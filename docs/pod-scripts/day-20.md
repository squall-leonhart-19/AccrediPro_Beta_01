## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

you guys Sarah's team just sent me a PREVIEW of my website and I'm literally crying 😭

it looks SO professional. like... this is ME? this is MY practice?

I can't believe 3 days ago I was crying over Squarespace and now I have an actual real website with my story, my services, my booking link all set up

I don't even know what to say. this is wild

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 1 hr 15 min

wait WHAT it's only been like 3 days?!

Denise that's amazing!! I'm so jealous lol

you already look like a legit practitioner and you literally just started

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 2 hr 30 min

not gonna lie this is making me seriously reconsider

I've been telling myself I can figure out the tech stuff on my own but watching Denise go from stressed to this in 3 days...

maybe I should stop being stubborn 😅

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 3 hr 50 min

Denise I remember that exact feeling when I saw my website for the first time

it made everything feel REAL you know? like "oh wow I'm actually doing this"

congrats!! you're gonna blow up 💕

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 5 hr

thank you everyone 🥹

Cheryl honestly I was stubborn too for like a month. wasted so much time

if you're thinking about it, just DM Sarah. at least hear what it's about

I'm so glad I stopped trying to do everything myself
