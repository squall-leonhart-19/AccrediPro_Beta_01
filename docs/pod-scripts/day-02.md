## FULL SCRIPTS:

okay maybe this is a dumb question but...

in the module about inflammation they talk about "chronic low-grade inflammation" being different from like normal inflammation when you get hurt

how do people even know if they have chronic inflammation? like is there a test or do you just guess based on symptoms?

sorry if this is basic I just want to make sure I understand it right

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 35 min

not a dumb question at all Lisa! this is actually one of the most important concepts to understand 💕

so yes there are tests:
- CRP (C-Reactive Protein) is the most common one
- ESR (sed rate) 
- sometimes homocysteine or ferritin can give clues too

but here's the thing... a lot of people with chronic low-grade inflammation have "normal" labs because the reference ranges are so wide

so we also look at symptoms:
- fatigue that doesn't go away with sleep
- brain fog
- joint pain that moves around
- skin issues
- digestive problems
- mood issues

when someone has several of these plus elevated markers, that's when we're pretty confident it's chronic inflammation

you'll learn more about this in the lab interpretation module but you're asking exactly the right questions! 🌿

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 1 hr 50 min

omg Lisa I had the same exact question when I went through that section

I literally wrote it down to ask Sarah and then kept reading and was like "wait maybe it's obvious and I'm just missing it" lol

so glad you asked because now I understand it better too!

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 3 hr 15 min

okay this makes so much more sense now thank you Sarah!! 

and Denise I felt the same way lol like maybe everyone else just gets it and I'm slow?? but apparently not haha

I love that we can just ask stuff here 💕
