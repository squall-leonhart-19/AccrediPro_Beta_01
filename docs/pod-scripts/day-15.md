## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

so the certification high is wearing off and now I'm like... what do I actually DO with this?? 😅

I have all this knowledge in my head but no idea how to turn it into an actual practice

like do I need a website? how do I get clients? what do I even charge?

feeling a little lost honestly. anyone else going through this or is it just me?

---

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 50 min

Denise this is EXACTLY what I'm worried about

like I'm still in the modules but I keep thinking "great I'll be certified but then what"

the clinical stuff I can learn. the business stuff scares me way more

---

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 5 min

you guys I felt the exact same way after I certified

honestly the business side is where most people get stuck. the certification gives you the knowledge but not really the "how to actually get clients" part

I ended up figuring it out but it took me way longer than it needed to because I had no clue what I was doing with marketing and tech stuff

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 3 hr 30 min

Denise and Lisa this is THE most common thing I hear 💕

and honestly... it's the biggest gap in most certifications. they teach you the clinical stuff but not how to build a business around it

here's the reality: the knowledge you have is valuable. but getting it in front of the right people requires a totally different skillset

the good news? it's not as complicated as it seems. there's a path to follow

I actually work with some students more closely on this part but we can talk about that another time. for now, just know you're not alone in feeling this way

you didn't come this far to stop now 🌿

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 5 hr

that actually makes me feel better

I kept thinking I was supposed to somehow just KNOW how to do the business stuff too

Sarah I'd love to hear more about what you mentioned whenever you have time 💕
