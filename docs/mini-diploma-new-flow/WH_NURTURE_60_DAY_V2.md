### Email 2 - Day 1: Sarah's Story
**Subject:** Re: my story (thought you'd relate)

```
{{firstName}},

Can I tell you a little bit of my story?

A few years ago, I was a single mom trying to keep everything together.

By day, I was working long hours, giving clients the same generic "eat better, drink water, exercise" advice I'd seen online. By night, I was collapsing on the couch, wondering how I could ever provide the kind of life my child deserved.

Inside, I felt like a fraud.

I loved helping people, but when clients came to me with real struggles - chronic fatigue, brain fog, hormonal chaos - I didn't know what to do. I could see the disappointment in their eyes when I said, "You should ask your doctor about that."

Meanwhile, my own health was unraveling. Stress, exhaustion, and the heavy weight of "doing it all" as a single mom.

I remember standing in the kitchen one night, staring at the bills, fighting back tears, and thinking: "There has to be more than this. There has to be a better way."

That's when I found root-cause health. That's when I got certified.

It was like someone handed me the missing puzzle pieces: finally understanding how to look at root causes, how to make sense of symptoms, how to design real protocols that worked.

But more than that - it gave me back my hope. And my identity.

I went from "Sarah who tries to help" to "Sarah, Certified Practitioner." The alphabet after my name changed everything. Clients trusted me. I trusted myself.

And now? I get to live what once felt impossible: helping women transform their health at the root level, while being present for my child and proud of the work I do.

That's why I'm so passionate about this path - because if I could step from survival into purpose, I know you can too.

So tell me, {{firstName}} - what made you curious about women's health? What's your story?

Hit reply. I want to hear it.

With love,

Sarah

### Email 17 - Day 36: The Credential That Changes Everything (NEW)
**Subject:** Re: the credential that changes everything

```
{{firstName}},

Can I show you something?

This is the transformation I see over and over:

BEFORE WH-FC Certification:
"{{firstName}} - Health Enthusiast"
- No title to use professionally
- Clients hesitate to pay
- Not listed anywhere
- Introduces herself as "interested in health"

AFTER WH-FC Certification:
"{{firstName}}, WH-FC - Certified Women's Health Practitioner"
- Professional credential recognized by CMA, CPD, IPHM
- Clients trust and pay immediately
- Listed in ASI Directory (clients find HER)
- Introduces herself as a certified professional

That little change - those letters after your name - it transforms EVERYTHING.

Here's what WH-FC gives you:

The Credential: "WH-FC" - Women's Health Foundation Certified
You can legally use this title. On your website. LinkedIn. Business cards. Email signature.

The Badge: Professional digital badge you can display anywhere
Shows you're verified. Links to your credential page.

The Directory Listing: You appear in ASI's public practitioner search
Women looking for "certified women's health practitioner near me" can FIND you.

The Verification Page: Anyone can verify your credential
https://accredipro.com/verify/[YOUR-ID]
Shows your name, credential, status, issue date.

The Identity: You become someone new
You're not "interested in women's health" anymore. You're a certified practitioner. The way you carry yourself changes. The way others see you changes.

Maria told me: "The day I updated my LinkedIn to show WH-FC was the day everything clicked. I wasn't 'trying to be' a practitioner anymore. I WAS one."

You're not buying a course.
You're becoming a new person with a new identity and a new career.

Ready to become {{firstName}}, WH-FC?

Just reply.

### Email 20 - Day 42: How Clients Find You (NEW)
**Subject:** Re: how clients find you

```
{{firstName}},

Can I tell you about the ASI Practitioner Directory?

Most certification programs teach you skills... then leave you to figure out how to get clients.

We do something different.

When you become WH-FC certified, you're automatically listed in our public Practitioner Directory.

Here's how it works:

1. A woman in Dallas searches Google for "certified women's health practitioner near me"

2. The ASI Directory ranks high (we've invested heavily in SEO)

3. She finds three WH-FC practitioners in the Dallas area

4. She clicks your profile, sees your credentials, and sends an inquiry

5. You get an email: "New client request from ASI Directory"

This isn't theoretical. Our practitioners report:

Diane: "3 of my first 5 clients came from directory searches"
Michelle: "I get 2-3 inquiries per week. I don't do any marketing."
Kelly: "I stopped running Facebook ads. The directory is enough."

Average certified practitioner: 4-7 directory inquiries per month

These are warm leads. Women actively searching for certified help.

No cold calling. No dancing on TikTok. No awkward networking.

Just your profile in the directory, and women finding YOU.

This alone - the passive client acquisition - is worth more than the investment.

P.S. Your directory listing goes live within 48 hours of certification. No extra fee. No annual cost. Included forever.
