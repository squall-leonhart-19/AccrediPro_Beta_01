REQUIREMENTS,Prerequisites,"What base level of education is required?","Great question! 💫 NO formal education is required! We've designed the curriculum to teach you everything from scratch - foundational anatomy all the way to advanced clinical protocols. Our 1,447+ graduates include former teachers, accountants, stay-at-home moms, nurses, and complete career changers. The key requirement is simply a genuine passion for helping people heal naturally. Our oldest graduate was 58! I'm Sarah, and I started at 47 after years of nursing burnout. If you have the desire to help people, you have what it takes. 💚","Hey! I'm so glad you reached out! 💚

This is exactly the question I had before I started my journey...

The beautiful truth? ZERO formal education required.

I'm Sarah - I was a burned-out nurse at 47, exhausted and feeling stuck. I thought I needed another degree. I was WRONG.

Our curriculum is designed from the ground up - you'll learn everything you need, whether you've never taken a science class or you're already a healthcare pro.

Here's the thing... we actually have a few spots open in our current enrollment window, and at $97 (normally $997), this pricing won't last.

I don't want you to miss this. I ALMOST didn't enroll myself because I had the same doubts. Now I make $135K working 20 hours/week from home.

Rooting for you! 💚

REQUIREMENTS,Nursing Question,"Do you need to be a nurse? Is this for RNs only?","Not at all! 💪 While so many nurses love this program (I was one!), it's completely open to EVERYONE. Some of our most successful graduates had zero medical background - former teachers, coaches, even artists! The magic is in the curriculum - it teaches you everything step by step. We have 1,447+ graduates from all walks of life building thriving practices. I'm Sarah, and I went from nursing burnout to running a $135K/year practice from home. Your background doesn't limit you - your commitment does! ✨","Hey there! 💚

I love this question because I get it - I was a nurse for years and thought that WAS my path.

But here's the truth: You absolutely do NOT need to be a nurse.

In fact, some of our TOP graduates were:
✓ A former special ed teacher (now earning $11K/month)
✓ A stay-at-home mom (now fully booked with a waitlist)
✓ A stressed-out executive (now helping others heal)

I'm Sarah - I happened to be a nurse, but that's not what made me successful in functional medicine. The TRAINING made me successful.

And right now, we have spots available at the special $97 rate (normally $997). This is the lowest price we've ever offered.

I saved a spot for you:

Don't let 'I'm not qualified enough' stop you. I felt that way too... now I'm living proof it was just fear talking.

Let's do this together 💪

REQUIREMENTS,Age Concern,"Am I too old to start this?","Oh my goodness, ABSOLUTELY NOT! 🌟 Can I be honest? Age is your SUPERPOWER. Clients want practitioners with life experience, wisdom, and understanding. They trust someone who has lived! Our oldest graduate was 58 and she's absolutely thriving with a waitlist. I started at 47 myself after years of nursing, and now I work 20 hours/week from home earning more than I ever did in the hospital. Many of our most successful graduates are in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Your life experience makes you MORE relatable, not less! 💚","Listen, I need to tell you something important... 💚

When I was 47, I asked myself the exact same question. 'Am I too old? Is it too late?'

I almost didn't enroll. I almost let that voice win.

Thank GOD I didn't listen.

Today I work 20 hours a week from home, earn $135K, and have a 3-month client waitlist. I have more energy, more purpose, and more freedom than I did in my 30s.

Here's what I've learned: CLIENTS PREFER practitioners with life experience. They want someone who GETS IT. Someone who's lived. Someone with wisdom.

Our oldest graduate was 58. She's one of our biggest success stories.

Your age isn't an obstacle. It's your competitive advantage.

I held a spot for you - this could be YOUR second chapter:

Don't wait another year wondering 'what if.' I almost made that mistake.

You've got this! 💚

COST,Price,"What is the cost? How much does this cost?","Great question! 💫 Right now we have a very special offer at $97 (normally $997) for the complete Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner program. That includes all 21 comprehensive modules, the certification exam, your official credentials, lifetime access, and practice-building resources. We made this accessible because we believe everyone deserves this knowledge - traditional programs charge $5,000-$15,000 for the same training. I'm Sarah, and this is honestly the most accessible path to a thriving functional medicine practice that I've ever seen! 🎉","Hey! Thanks for reaching out! 🙌

I'm about to tell you something that might sound too good to be true...

The complete Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner program is $97 right now.

Yes. Ninety-seven dollars. I'm not kidding.

Now here's the thing... it's normally $997. We have this special pricing because our mission is to make functional medicine ACCESSIBLE. We believe everyone deserves this knowledge.

But this price won't last. It can't. We've already had over 1,447 graduates at this rate and...

Okay, I need to be honest with you. I don't know exactly when it's going back to $997. It could be next week. I just don't want you to miss it.

COST,Value/Worth,"Is this legit? $97 seems too cheap.","I completely understand the skepticism - I felt it too! 💭 Here's the truth: traditional programs charge $5,000-$15,000 for this level of training. We made a conscious decision to make it accessible because we believe everyone deserves this knowledge. We have 1,447+ REAL graduates building thriving practices, 9 recognized accrediting bodies, and hundreds of verified reviews. I'm Sarah - I'm a real person with a real story. I was skeptical too when I enrolled, but it changed my life. Now I earn $135K working 20 hours/week from home. The curriculum is comprehensive - 21 modules of deep clinical training. It's 100% legit. ✨","I love that you're protecting yourself - that's smart! 💪

Let me be completely transparent with you...

Traditional functional medicine certifications cost $5,000 to $15,000. Some cost even MORE.

When I was looking to get certified, I almost couldn't afford it. I was a nurse making $68K with bills piling up. The $8,000 program I was looking at? Impossible.

That's exactly why AccrediPro exists.

We believe this knowledge changes lives - for practitioners AND for clients. So we made a decision: Go high-volume, low-price. Make it accessible to EVERYONE.

Is it legit? Here's your proof:
✓ 1,447+ graduates with real practices
✓ 9 recognized accrediting bodies you can Google
✓ Hundreds of verified 5-star reviews
✓ Real success stories you can verify
✓ Me - Sarah. Real person. Real story. Real results.

The curriculum is COMPREHENSIVE. I'm talking 21 modules of deep clinical training. Gut healing protocols. Hormone interpretation. Lab analysis. Everything.

Your risk? $97. Your potential upside? A six-figure career helping people actually heal.

I wouldn't steer you wrong:

COST,Refund,"Is there a refund policy?","Absolutely! 💯 We completely stand behind our program - yes, we have a satisfaction guarantee. We're confident you'll love it because over 1,447+ graduates have transformed their careers with this training. I'm Sarah, and I personally believe in this program - it changed MY life. The people who ask about refunds are usually the thorough, careful types - those same qualities make amazing practitioners! We want you to feel completely secure in your decision. 🙌","Great question - this tells me you're a smart decision-maker! 💚

Yes, we stand behind our program 100%.

But here's what I want you to know...

In my experience, the people who ask about refunds are usually the ones who DON'T need them. You're thorough. You're careful. Those same qualities make amazing practitioners.

Over 1,447 people have gone through this program. The overwhelming majority not only complete it - they come back raving about how it changed their lives.

I did. It gave me my freedom back.

That said - your peace of mind matters. If for any reason you're not satisfied, we've got you covered.

But honestly? I don't think you'll need it. I think you're going to watch the first few modules and think 'Why didn't I do this sooner?'

That's what happened to me.

CREDENTIALS,Accreditation,"What are your credentials? Who accredits this?","Such an important question! 🏆 Our program is recognized by 9 major accrediting bodies including CMA (Complementary Medical Association), IICT (International Institute of Complementary Therapists), CPD (Continuing Professional Development), IPHM (International Practitioners of Holistic Medicine), and more. These are the same organizations that credential professional coaches and practitioners globally - real accreditations you can verify.

CLIENTS,Getting Clients,"How do you get clients? Who hires you?","Such a smart business question! 💼 Most of our graduates build their own practice and work for themselves - that's the beauty of it! You can work virtually from home (most popular), open a local practice, partner with wellness clinics, or contract with integrative doctors. The demand is INCREDIBLE right now - functional medicine practitioners are in short supply. Our grads typically charge $150-300/hour and many have 2-6 month waitlists! I'm Sarah, and I have a 3-month waitlist working from my home office 20 hours/week. The key is: when you can actually help people heal root causes, word spreads FAST. 🚀","THIS is the question of a future business owner! I love it. 💼

Here's the reality that might surprise you...

Most Certified Functional Medicine Practitioners don't work FOR someone. They work for THEMSELVES.

And the demand? It's honestly overwhelming.

Here's what our graduates are doing:
✓ Virtual practice from home (most popular - this is what I do!)
✓ Local in-person practice
✓ Partnering with wellness clinics
✓ Contracting with integrative doctors

Here's the secret: When you can actually HELP people heal root causes, they tell EVERYONE. Word spreads. Referrals flood in. 

I have a 3-month waitlist right now. I could easily charge more than I do. The demand exists - you just need the skills to meet it.

That's exactly what this certification gives you.

CLIENTS,Marketing,"How do you market yourself?","Great entrepreneur mindset! 📈 Honestly, the best part? Your RESULTS market you. When clients actually heal, they tell everyone - that's how most successful practitioners build their practice. Common strategies include social media content (sharing tips), word-of-mouth referrals, local networking, and basic online presence. The program includes business-building modules, and our Pro bundle goes deep on client attraction. I'm Sarah, and I built my practice almost entirely on referrals because my clients were getting real results and couldn't stop telling people! 💫","I love that you're already thinking about the business side! 📈

Here's something that might surprise you...

Marketing as a functional medicine practitioner is actually EASY. Why? Because demand far exceeds supply.

People are DESPERATE for practitioners who actually listen and help.

What works for our graduates:
✓ Simple social media content (share tips, people find you)
✓ Word-of-mouth referrals (clients rave about results)
✓ Local networking (other practitioners refer to you)
✓ Basic online presence (website, Google Business)

But here's the real secret...

When you help someone heal - I mean REALLY heal - after doctors gave up on them? They become your biggest marketer. They tell everyone.

I built my practice almost entirely on referrals. I barely 'market' anymore. My calendar fills itself.

That can be you.

The base certification includes practice-building modules. The Pro bundle ($397) goes DEEP on client attraction.

SCOPE,State Regulations,"How many states allow this without a degree?","Perfect compliance question! 🗺️ Great news: This is HEALTH COACHING and wellness consulting - not practicing medicine. You're coaching clients on lifestyle, nutrition, supplements, and wellness protocols. You're NOT diagnosing, treating, or prescribing (that requires medical licensure). This scope of practice is 100% legal in ALL 50 states under health coaching/wellness consulting. Many of our grads actually partner WITH doctors to enhance patient care - doctors love having someone who can focus on the lifestyle piece! I'm Sarah, and I work alongside 3 different MDs. It's a beautiful collaboration. ✨","Smart question - you're already thinking like a professional! 👏

Let me clear this up because it's actually great news...

What we train is HEALTH COACHING / WELLNESS CONSULTING. Not practicing medicine.

You're NOT:
❌ Diagnosing diseases
❌ Prescribing medications
❌ Treating medical conditions

You ARE:
✅ Coaching clients on nutrition and lifestyle
✅ Interpreting functional lab patterns
✅ Designing wellness protocols
✅ Guiding holistic health decisions

This scope of practice is completely legal in ALL 50 states.

SCOPE,Medical Practice,"Can I prescribe? How do nurses get meds for clients?","Great clarification question! 🌿 This is wellness coaching and health consulting - you work on lifestyle, nutrition, supplements, and wellness protocols. You do NOT prescribe medications (that requires a medical license). For clients who need prescriptions, many practitioners partner with like-minded MDs, refer to integrative medicine doctors, or collaborate with the client's existing physician. I'm Sarah, and I personally work alongside 3 different doctors - they handle prescriptions when needed, I handle the lifestyle transformation. It's a powerful model that protects you legally while maximizing your impact! 💚","Great question for clarity! 💚

As a Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner, you work in the wellness/coaching space - you don't prescribe medications.

Your role is coaching clients on:
✓ Lifestyle changes
✓ Nutrition protocols
✓ Supplement recommendations
✓ Wellness optimization

For clients needing prescriptions, many practitioners:
1️⃣ Partner with like-minded MDs
2️⃣ Refer to integrative medicine doctors
3️⃣ Collaborate with client's existing physician

Coming home exhausted, giving patients surface-level advice that never actually fixed anything. One night I sat in my car and cried because I knew there had to be MORE.

At 47, I was done.

Exhausted from 12-hour hospital shifts. Making $68K that barely covered my bills. Coming home too tired to enjoy my family. Giving patients the same surface-level advice that never actually FIXED anything.

One night, I sat in my car in the hospital parking lot and cried.

I knew there had to be MORE. But I felt trapped. Too old for a career change. Too broke for more school. Too scared to try something new.

Then I discovered functional medicine.

At first, I was skeptical. '$97 for a certification? Has to be a scam.' But something made me enroll anyway.

That decision changed EVERYTHING.

Within 6 weeks, I had my first paying client.
By month 4, I'd replaced my nursing income.
Today? I work 20 hours/week from home.
I earn $135K/year.
I have a 3-month client waitlist.

INCOME,Income Potential,"How much can you really make?","Such a smart question! 💰 Here's the realistic breakdown: Starting practitioners typically charge $100-150/hour. Established practitioners charge $200-350/hour. Working 15-25 clients/week (very manageable), that's $100K-$200K+ annually. Many of our graduates replaced their full-time income within 4-6 months. Best part? You set your own hours from home, cash-pay clients (no insurance headaches), and clients willingly pay for practitioners who actually get results. I'm Sarah - went from $68K exhausted to $135K working 20 hours/week by month 12. It's real, and it's possible for you too! 🚀","Let's talk real numbers! 💰

Here's what I've seen across our 1,447+ graduates...

Starting practitioners: $100-150/hour
Established practitioners: $200-350/hour

Let's run simple math:

💫 15 clients/week at $150/hour = $117K/year
💫 20 clients/week at $200/hour = $208K/year

And here's the kicker: You set your OWN hours.

Want to work school hours only? ✓
Want to take summers off? ✓
Want to only see clients 3 days/week? ✓

Many of our graduates replaced their full-time income within 4-6 months of starting.

I went from $68K (working 50+ hours/week in a hospital) to $135K (working 20 hours/week from my home office).

The clients are out there. They're DESPERATE for help. They'll gladly pay for someone who actually listens and gets results.

You just need the skills. That's what this certification gives you.

DEMOGRAPHICS,Gender,"Says for women only, no men apparently.","Oh no, absolutely not! 💪 Our marketing tends to feature more women because they're our largest demographic (healthcare/nursing skews female), but men are 100% welcome! About 15% of our graduates are men and they're CRUSHING IT in their practices. No gender restrictions whatsoever. Men often stand OUT in this field because there are fewer of them - clients looking for a male practitioner will specifically seek you out! I'm Sarah, and I'd love to see more men in this field. You're not just welcome - you're needed! 🙌","Great catch on the marketing! 💪

You're right that our ads mostly feature women - they are our largest demographic (healthcare/nursing skews female).

But men are ABSOLUTELY welcome!

About 15% of our graduates are men, and honestly? Some of our most successful practitioners are guys.

There are NO gender restrictions whatsoever.

Men often stand OUT in this field because there are fewer of them. Clients looking for someone who 'gets' them might specifically WANT a male practitioner.

So if you're a guy reading this: You're not just welcome. You're NEEDED.
