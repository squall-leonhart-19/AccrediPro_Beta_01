## Just Certified Posts

### Jennifer Martinez (Austin, TX)
```
🎉 I DID IT!!!

Just got my Board Certification email and I literally cried.

6 months ago I was a burned-out nurse who thought "wellness coaching" was just for influencers. Now I have NINE international accreditations and a real path forward.

The DEPTH Method training was incredible. I finally understand root-cause thinking in a way nursing school never taught me.

To everyone still going through the modules - KEEP GOING. It's so worth it.

💛 Jennifer

Pharmacist for 18 years. Skeptic by nature.

I almost didn't sign up because I thought "another certification won't change anything."

I was wrong.

Just completed my Board Certification and the difference is... I actually understand WHY things work now. Not just what drug to dispense.

Already have 2 colleagues asking how they can do this too.

If you're a healthcare professional on the fence - this fills the gaps your degree left.

CERTIFIED!! 🎓

When I started, I couldn't even explain what functional medicine was to my husband. Now I just completed a 45-minute consultation framework presentation for my mentor call and Sarah said it was "practitioner-level."

ME. A former stay-at-home mom with zero health background.

If I can do this, literally anyone can.

Thank you Sarah and this incredible community!!

From yoga teacher to Board Certified Practitioner.

The journey took me 14 weeks (I went slow because life), but today I got the email.

What hit me hardest during the training: the "Clients From Scratch" module. I was so scared I'd never find clients. Now I have a waitlist.

Actually crying typing this.

## First Client Posts

### Lisa Chen (San Diego, CA)

🚨 FIRST CLIENT BOOKED!! 🚨

$200 for a 90-minute deep dive consultation.

She found me through my LinkedIn credential (thank you ASI verification!!) and said she'd been looking for someone who actually LISTENS.

I'm nervous and excited and I think I might throw up but THIS IS REAL.

Update coming after the session! 🙏

Update from yesterday's post...

MY FIRST CLIENT SIGNED A 3-MONTH PACKAGE!!

$1,800 total. She paid in full.

I used the pricing calculator Sarah gave us and almost chickened out because it felt "too expensive." But she didn't even blink.

Ladies... charge your worth. The training taught us things most practitioners never learn. OWN IT.

First client story time:

A friend of a friend heard I got certified. She's been dealing with chronic fatigue for 3 years. Doctors keep saying "your labs are normal."

Did a free discovery call using the template from Module 15.

She cried. Said no one had ever asked her those questions.

Signed up for my 12-week program on the spot.

This is why we do this. 💛

## Income Milestone Posts

### Rebecca Torres (Phoenix, AZ)
```
Month 3 income report (because transparency matters):

Week 1-4: $0 (building, learning, terrified)
Month 2: $1,200 (2 clients, finding my feet)
Month 3: $4,800 (4 clients, 2 package upgrades)

That's working 15 hours/week around my kids' school schedule.

For context: I'm 47, started with ZERO health background, and thought I was "too old" for a career change.

The mentorship calls with Sarah are everything. She literally walked me through my first sales conversation.

Six months certified. Here's what happened:

Month 1: $800
Month 2: $2,100
Month 3: $3,400
Month 4: $5,200
Month 5: $6,800
Month 6: $8,100

Total: $26,400 in 6 months. Part-time.

I quit my corporate job last month. Working from home. Making my own schedule.

This certification changed my life. That's not an exaggeration.

I need to share this because a year ago I wouldn't have believed it.

Just hit my first $10K month.

10 clients. Average package: $1,200. Working from my home office while my kids are at school.

I was a high school teacher making $52K/year, exhausted, and felt stuck.

Now I help women fix their gut health and hormones. And I make more in 2 months than I made in a semester.

If you're reading this and thinking "but I'm not special"... neither am I. I just decided.

## Transformation Story Posts

### Megan Davis (Philadelphia, PA)
```
One year ago today, I took the Mini Diploma quiz on a whim.

Today:
- Board Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner
- 12 active clients
- $6K+/month income
- Actually EXCITED to wake up and work

One year ago:
- Burned out nurse, 12-hour shifts
- Constant anxiety
- Felt like I was just surviving
- $0 side income, mountains of student debt

The certification cost me $297 on scholarship.
My first 3 clients paid that back in week one.

This community saved my career. Maybe my life.

Story time: How I went from "I can't afford this" to "I can't afford NOT to do this"

When I saw the scholarship offer, I had $312 in my checking account. The certification was $297.

I sat there for an hour, terrified.

Then I thought: "What's the cost of NOT doing this? Another year in a job I hate?"

I enrolled. Had $15 left.

That was 8 months ago.

This month I made $7,200 helping women with hormone health.

Sometimes the scariest decisions are the right ones. 💛

My husband thought I was crazy.

"Another certification? You already have a degree."

But this one was different. It wasn't just theory. It was:
- Real clinical training
- Business systems included
- Actual mentorship with Sarah
- A community that becomes family

Now he asks me for health advice. 😂

And my practice brings in more than his salary.

To everyone whose family doesn't "get it" yet... they will. Just keep going.

## Tips & Encouragement Posts

### Lauren Wallace (Detroit, MI)
```
PSA for everyone in the modules right now:

Take the assessments seriously.

I know it's tempting to rush through, but the case studies in Modules 12-15 are GOLD. I literally use those frameworks with every client now.

Also: don't skip the Business Accelerator content. That's where the real magic is.

You've got this! 💪

Tips from someone 9 months in:

1. Start your LinkedIn profile BEFORE you finish. The credential badge matters.

2. Use the "First 5 Clients" system exactly as taught. Don't reinvent.

3. Join EVERY mentorship call. Even if you're tired. Even if you "don't have questions."

4. Your first client will probably be someone you already know. That's okay.

5. Imposter syndrome is normal. Do it scared.

This community has your back. 💛

For the nurses, pharmacists, and healthcare workers in here:

I know it feels weird to "start over."

You already have letters after your name. You already "know" health.

But this certification fills the gaps. The root-cause thinking. The time with patients. The business skills.

It's not starting over. It's leveling up.

I went from pharmacist burnout to thriving practice owner. Same knowledge base, completely different impact.

You belong here. 💛

## Post Scheduling Notes

1. **New posts** - Add 2-3 new posts per week from different zombies
2. **Engagement** - Like/comment counts should slowly increase over time
3. **Timestamps** - Posts should be backdated realistically (oldest = 8-12 months ago)
