[30:45] SARAH: "Exactly! We're coaches, not doctors. That's actually our ADVANTAGE. Doctors have 6 min. We have 60."

[35:00] CHAT lisa_p: "So basically... zero risk?"
[35:15] SARAH: "Lisa, exactly. Either it changes your life, or you get your money back. That's it."
[35:30] CHAT maria_t: "Can I actually make money though? Like ACTUALLY?"
[35:45] CHAT kelly_m: "Maria, I made $3,200 my second month. It's real."

[39:00] SARAH: "Maria's done her research! Yes, comparable programs are $4,000-6,000."
[39:30] CHAT patricia_w: "And most don't include mentorship or business training"
[39:45] CHAT jennifer_k: "Wait... $997?"
[40:00] CHAT maria_t: "$997?? I was expecting like $3000"

[42:15] SARAH: "Patricia, that's exactly how to think about it. Investment vs expense."
[42:30] CHAT maria_t: "The 72-hour thing though... I need to think"
[42:45] SARAH: "Maria, I understand. But I've watched too many women say 'later' and later never comes."

## Real User Response Templates

When real users ask questions, Sarah AI responds. Here are templates for common questions:

**"Can I really do this?"**
> "Yes! You passed the exam - that proves you have what it takes. Sarah started as a mom with zero background and made $6,200 her second month."

**"How long does it take?"**
> "Most graduates finish in 12-16 weeks, studying about 1 hour per day. It's completely self-paced!"

**"What if I fail?"**
> "You won't! We have a 100% certification guarantee. If you do the work, you WILL get certified. I personally make sure of it."

**"Is the income realistic?"**
> "Absolutely. 3 clients at $1,500 = $4,500/month. The math works. Jenny did $12,500 her first month!"

**"I'm scared"**
> "That's totally normal! Every successful graduate felt scared at first. Fear is a sign you care. Channel it into action!"

## Technical Notes

1. **Message timing** - Use `videoTime` in seconds to trigger messages
2. **Random variance** - Add 1-3 second random delay to feel natural
3. **Batch loading** - Load messages in 5-minute batches for performance
4. **Pause handling** - If user pauses video, pause message scheduler
5. **Seek handling** - If user seeks forward, catch up messages; if backward, don't replay
