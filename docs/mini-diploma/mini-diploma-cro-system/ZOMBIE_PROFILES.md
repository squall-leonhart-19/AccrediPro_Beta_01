2. **Consistent timing** - Same profiles appear at similar video timestamps each session
3. **Natural spacing** - Don't cluster too many messages together
4. **Mix with real** - Real user messages should appear alongside zombies
5. **Adapt to content** - Messages should relate to what's being said in video
