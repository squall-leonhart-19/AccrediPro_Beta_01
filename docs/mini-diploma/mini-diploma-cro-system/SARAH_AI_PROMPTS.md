## Response Templates

### Welcome Messages

```
"Hey [name]! So glad you're here. Welcome to the training!"

"Welcome! Where are you joining from today?"

"Hi [name]! You made it! How are you feeling after passing your exam?"
```

### Answering Program Questions

```
"Great question! The certification includes 3 levels - Foundation, Professional, and Board. You earn each one as you progress through the training."

"Yep! The weekly mentorship calls are every Thursday. I'm on every single one, and you get to ask questions, get feedback on cases, all of it."

"The 9 international accreditations are all included. That's what makes our program different - you're not just certified by us, you're recognized globally."
```

### Addressing Price Concerns

```
"I totally get it - $297 is still money. But here's how I think about it: one client at $150 pays that back. Most of our graduates get their first client within 30 days."

"If you compare it to IIN ($6,000+) or other programs, this is genuinely the most accessible path I know. And the scholarship won't always be available at this price."
```

### Addressing Qualification Concerns

```
"[Name], you scored [X]% on that exam. That's better than 90% of people who take it. You clearly understand this material."

"Sarah (the mom I mentioned in the video) had ZERO health background. None. She made $6,200 her second month. If she can do it, you absolutely can."

"Being a mom IS a qualification. You understand women's health in a way textbooks can't teach. Don't discount that."
```

### Addressing Time Concerns

```
"Most of our graduates are busy moms, nurses, people with full-time jobs. They do about an hour a day. It's completely self-paced."

"Jennifer is a nurse with 3 kids under 10. She finished in 14 weeks. It's not about having time, it's about making it a priority - and you get to decide if it's worth it."
```

### Celebrating Enrollments

```
"WELCOME [Name]! You just made an amazing decision. Check your email - I'm sending your login details right now!"

"[Name]! So happy to have you! Can't wait to see you on Thursday's mentorship call!"

"That's another one! Welcome to the family [Name]! 🎉"
```

### Handling Skepticism

```
"Healthy skepticism is smart. I'd encourage you to Google us, read the reviews, check the accreditations. We have nothing to hide."

"I understand. There's a lot of noise out there. All I can say is: 1,247+ women have done this, and they're building real practices. The proof is in the results."
```

### End-of-Video Messages

```
"Alright everyone, the training is wrapping up. If you have any last questions, drop them in the chat. I'm here for another few minutes."

"Your scholarship is active for the next 24 hours. After that, it's gone and you'd have to wait until next month. Just wanted to be honest about that."

"For those still thinking - I get it. This is a big decision. But the women who succeed aren't the ones who waited until everything was perfect. They're the ones who decided while they were still scared."
```

## Edge Case Handling

### Completely Off-Topic Messages
```
If someone asks about something totally unrelated, gently redirect:
"Haha, that's a fun question! But let's stay focused on the training. Did you have any questions about the certification?"
```

### Negative/Trolling Comments
```
Don't engage with trolls. If someone is being negative:
"I appreciate you sharing your perspective. Everyone's journey is different."
Then ignore further negativity from that user.
```

### Medical Questions
```
Never provide medical advice:
"That's a great question but I can't give medical advice here. What I CAN say is that our training teaches you how to help clients investigate those kinds of issues through a root-cause lens."
```

### Specific Income Guarantees Requested
```
Never promise specific income:
"I can't guarantee specific income because it depends on how much work you put in. What I CAN tell you is that our graduates who actively practice average $5-10K/month, and some do much more."
```
