      "content": "I am a retired nurse who has experienced a lot of different types of nursing and all were good. Now retired I was looking for something to fill the void that was part of my life for 40 years. Whatever I was searching for was not to include a 5 AM alarm, a 2 hour a day commute, and no weekends or holidays. Don't misunderstand though, I do not mind putting my heart and soul into my work. At this point of my life I would like it to be on my terms not to be so selfish. I am a certified health coach. I passed the exam last year but have not worked at this yet. I put things in place but have not marketed and so on. Your introduction was very interesting. I am someone who loves to evaluate and analyze things. I love to problem solve. Although I love many aspects of nursing, I truly love working with behavioral health or women's health. I decided that this may be what I need to move forward, and am hoping that this will take me where I want to go. Unfortunately now older, I can see it is harder for me to learn than when younger. I will need to put in the extra but that is fine with me. With the holidays coming I may be limited on some time since we will be going away for a week and having family visit for another week but I will certainly do my best. Thank. you for letting me express myself. Diane",

I've worked in colleges, clinics and hospitals for 25+ years, educating people of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds on disease prevention and health promotion. Health and healing have always been my passion, so as I get older and realize that illnesses and diseases are more rampant than ever (mostly due to the health system being broken, plus the chemicals and hidden sugars in prepackaged foods and sedentarism) my desire is to serve those that have not found solutions in traditional medicine, so they can live healthier and happier lives. I'm also a Certified Life Coach, a T2 Diabetes Counselor, and I hold a diploma in Humanistic Psychology, which have helped me understand human behavior at a deeper level. I believe my combined education can greatly improve the lives of many.",

The curriculum emphasized the study of disease and dis-ease, and it was there that I discovered my fascination with anatomy, physiology, and the body’s remarkable capacity for healing. In 2023, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s, which deepened my commitment to understanding the body on a functional level. Through diet and lifestyle changes, I’ve been able to significantly improve my lab results, reinforcing my belief in a root-cause, whole-body approach to wellness. Since then, I have become increasingly drawn to functional medicine, mindfulness, and the integrative practices that help people reclaim health. I find myself continually listening to podcasts, learning from experts, and imagining how I might help others by evolving into a functional medicine practitioner. This program feels like the perfect next step—a structured way to expand my knowledge while allowing me to move at my own pace, which is essential as a business owner. I’m eager to build on my experience, deepen my understanding, and eventually support others on their healing journeys. Sarah, are you able to confirm that I will have lifetime access to the full course load I purchased? Thank you, Karyne",

After receiving my certification I trained harder than I ever had and ended up on a Bodybuilding stage as the 176lb class and overall winner of the Olympia Natural Classic in Olympia WA. After the win in Olympia people swarmed into my club and I spent the next five years helping others to realize their dreams of becoming something more! It was about that time I met this Woman. She was and still is drop dead gorgeous. I sold my club started a construction company and married a total knock out. 4 children and 10 Grandchildren later here I am! The things I believed to be true 40 years ago about fitness were not wrong they were just small pieces of a bigger truth that we are coming to realize. These are exciting times! My reason for being here is for my children and their children. You teach me I teach them and we all become something more!",

I know a lot more about online business and now I am ready to uplevel my health expertise. I have been focusing on women in perimenopause the past few months. I have had great success applying my systems to my own perimenopause symptoms. I work very intuitively so I have not relied on \"knowing\" all the protocols. I've had doctors send me their most difficult patients because I would \"do my magic\" and then would just get better. I am on this planet to awaken people to their Divine Healer within. I currently work with an amazing functional medicine practitioner for my own health support and I refer my clients to her regularly. I also have a 9 year old daughter with a brain injury and rare genetic mutation. I have spent her entire life learning about brain health and what it actually takes to heal the brain. I've been trained by IAHP.org to diagnose brain injury (not as a medical doctor so it's only to be used for my daughter). I look forward to learning from you, Sarah! Thank you.",

      "content": "I started having health issues at 32 years old after doing some painting in my first house I bought. The window were open while doing that. A week later,I started having dizzy spells,light headedness,sensitivity to fluorescent lights at home stores. I went to the dr. and he couldn't figure it out,giving me multiple prescriptions to try,that failed. I saw an ad in our local newspaper from a chiropractor who practice naturopathy modalities that was doing a seminar on finding out what is wrong with a person with ailments,naturally. I went to her for many years and she did some good things that helped,but still not to cure my illness. I became multiple chemical sensitive to everything with fragrances,gasoline,exhaust fumes,camp fires etc. I still have these symptoms and no one has been able to figure it out. Throughout the years since 2000,I became really intrigued to naturopathy and homeopathy alternative medicine and supplementation. From that point on,I had dreamed about becoming certified but didn't as prices were so high,that I could never afford it. So after caring for my elderly parents starting in 2012 and watching them deteriorate while the doctors give them all these toxic medications and misdiagnose,I knew someday I would turn to finding an opportunity like this. The final motivation was caring for my 88 year old mom at my home and having her live with me was a very life learning experience till she passed away this year on February 1st,2025. It was a super peaceful passing that I was so lucky to experience,just as my Dad's passing in September,2018 was also wonderful. Both did not show signs of pain or suffering. With my mom,I chose to not have any morphine paing meds of any kind and prayed that she would not need them and she didn't! The hospice team could not believe it,neither could I. It has been a trying time since her passing and I miss her dearly. I am healing little by little. I now know that I need purpose in my life to help educate others which I have been doing on a small level with friends and family. I always thought if I would of done this years ago and learned about functional medicine of how I could of helped both my mom and dad amongst many others. I have been out of work since my mom passed as I was her PCA and completed every single task for her to the end. So I know I have some knowledge,empathy more than anything to want to learn and get certified to help so many others along with my own health struggles that people don't teach or know. I have spent so much money over 25 years seeing many different practicioners which changed my life journey,but not to my expectations. With that being said,it is now my time to be the healer,life helper and make the money that I deserve!",

I have healed myself from depression with energy techniques. 3 years ago I woke up and couldn’t move from my neck down. Over the next 18 months the pain was excruciating and I lost so much weight. I was eventually diagnosed with PMR. I was put on steroids. They stopped the pain but I blotted out. My bloods always came back “ok”. I’m always tired, in pain and have zero motivation and the weight is upsetting me. I hardly eat because I’ve lost my appetite. I studied German New Medicine so I believe the body knows exactly what it’s doing. But I don’t have the confidence to get to the root quickly and help people out of pain quickly. I love learning about the body and why it does what it does. I believe this will give me more credibility and I also wanted to train to cure myself. I’m not spending another year like this. I’m trained in EFT, NLP, colour psychology, reiki, MetaHealth (GNM). I think they will enhance my approach. I love presenting and writing so I can see this is where I’ll expand. Also, doing research on supplements I’m shocked at all the crap out there! People deserve better. The only thing I’m concerned about is that your course is all US centric and I’m based in the UK. Do you have additional information for the legal requirements of UK people.? I’ve been useless at promoting what I do as it always comes across woo woo. With this I can see I’ll get more focused. I have several friends who are always tired and lack motivation. Maybe this is the route I am being guided down?",

Although I was able to “clear” the psoriasis, I knew I wasn’t healing myself. That is what led me to dive into holistic approaches. Fast forward to now, a mother of 2, a nurse with cardiac background currently working in GI, and still someone who feels a deep sacred and spiritual calling to heal. I have prayed for signs. I believe this is my answered peayer.",

I’ve spent years suffering with Lyme disease, going from doctor to doctor with no answers, and it took far too long to finally be diagnosed. Even after that, I had to go through multiple Lyme practitioners before finding the right one who could truly help me. Most of my healing has come from trusting my own intuition, muscle testing, and researching what my body actually needs. I’ve had to navigate mold, SIBO, and so many complications on my own because standard medical care failed me again and again. I’ve learned to dose my own supplements and medications more accurately than my doctors could because my body doesn’t fit into the “standard protocol” box. I know how terrifying it is to be sick and unsupported, and I know how life-changing it feels when someone finally understands the root causes and gives real guidance. Through all this suffering, something inside me keeps saying that none of this was for nothing—that my experience is meant to help others. I want to turn my pain into purpose. I know how lost and unsupported chronic illness can feel, and I want to guide others through the confusion with real understanding and compassion. I want to help people who are lost, overwhelmed, and dealing with chronic illness, and give them the clarity, validation, and direction I never had. This certification feels aligned, meaningful, and deeply important.",

I love the idea of functional nutrition and Medicine. I am a holistic nutrition consultant. I want to work with clients in a way to help them get to the root cause of their health challenges. Reading the description of this program I feel that this can give me the tools that I need to help my clients get there.",

I always felt disheartened knowing we'd be discharging them home to be right back from the root cause. Unfortunately this happened to my Nana. She came to my hospital, I reviewed her results begged them to be preventative when her results showed pulmonary hypertension and we ended up right back in the hospital 2 weeks later. She was lucky to make it back, but I know some people aren't. And that frustrated me immensely, especially since its my family they chose to send home not fully treated. I hate hospitals because many are money focused, the patients in our beds are dollar signs and us nurses are burnt out keeping up with corporate demands to make them more money. There's no heart behind corporate and it leads to tired, fatigued, angry, bitter nurses who do our best. I want to run a practice, do retreats for nurses in hospitals, and more. I also struggle with my own health ailments, and my mom recently is struggling with health ailments that are ruining her quality of life and the Dr's are just playing a guessing game. Im hoping to increase my knowledge to help the ones I love.",

I am in a full blown menopause and not enjoying anything anymore. I have every single symptom they listed and I’m in a process of getting an HRT. However, because of a suspicious mammogram result, they want to do a biopsy on a lump before they approve hormones. It will be at least another 2 months before I can start the therapy. So that course was for me. However, I always felt my calling was a psychotherapy, but I never finished school for it and now at 51 I feel like that is not something I can do. I’ve been searching for other ways I could have a similar practice, develop a specialty and hopefully build a successful practice with it. I’ve been practicing self-hypnosis for 35 yrs and I looked into getting a hypnotherapy certificate, but found out that in Florida, that school’s certificate would not allow me to practice professionally, because in FL to practice any type of therapy with the clients, you have to have a Masters degree in psychotherapy. The school itself did a research and informed me that I would not be able to make it a business in FL. So, I am looking to learn a bunch of new methods and practices on improving my own health and hopefully learn enough to be able to develop a successful business.",

Nobody in my family has such a thing and I knew this was lifestyle related. I had injured my tailbone about a decade before that. It had gotten so bad that it did not let me sleep at night because there was no position that was comfortable. I spent the entire decade before developing alopecia dreading nights because no position was comfortable to sleep in. That was a long and miserable life. It continued for another decade. I am much better right now and do get to sleep at night. I know that my lifestyle was not in alignment. I did not have the ability to seek help for my tailbone in time and I did not know that it would have such long-term consequences. This sparked my interest in Functional Medicine that takes care of the entire person as a whole unit, including their sleep, nutrition exercise, and whatever hormonally is going on inside the body. I have been to Functional Medicine doctors myself. My two kids have developed alopecia areata - one after Covid and one after some vaccines at the pediatric office. This again is very, very sad for me. My husband is a physician and he believes in diet and exercise, but he does not know much about Functional Medicine. Usually, I do not have a voice in these things because of his degree. I would like to learn more and have a voice in the house too on medical related things.",

People struggle with the finding root cause(s) to their problems and often times the western medical model does offer practical, simple solutions because they are not asking the right questions. What happened in my life that lead me to this moment? I have been repeatedly asking the questions in terms of myself and everyone else: \"Have you experienced a significant loss? In what ways has that loss and grief shaped and influenced your life? How do you think your life would be different if you had not had that experience? What choices have you made as a result of that loss? Has it affected your health in ways you are aware of? If you wanted your life and health to be different than it currently is, what would you change? What would you like to look like?\" This is the short answer.",

I am all about preventative medicine, supplements, and working out to build muscle, bone density and strength. I am a 2x cancer survivor (cervical and breast) with surgeries only...no chemo or radiation 🙌🙏 This new career path really excites me as I love to help my patients now by sharing what has helped me with supplements, food choices etc. So I can only imagine where all this wealth of information will take me with my caring, serving heart ❤️",

      "content": "I struggled with nerve pain for 6 years, started before I hit 30. I have seen at least 20 different doctors, and had multiple spinal injections. I was told that my nerve pain is caused by inflammation but no one seems to be interested in figuring out why my nerves are inflamed. They stated it was caused by narrowing space between L4-L5, L5-S1. But my image honestly did not look that bad. I keep taking pain killers, sugary food. At the worse, I can only work 5 hours a day and then needs to stay in bed for the rest of day. I put on weight, lost my ability to dance, eventually I started having insomnia before my period. And that is when a very knowledgeable pelvic floor specialist that I have been working with suggested me to see a functional medicine doctor. I did not like the doctor’s sales strategy, and found a coach instead. After getting my food sensitivity test result, my nerve pain disappeared within 2 months. I am on the fourth month of my gut healing journey. And know I can dance and weight lift again. My TSH is still high at 6.75. And it probably will take a while for my body to be ready for pregnancy. I forgot to mention know I understand why I keep miscarrying. Luckily at the moment, i can mostly function during the day without too much brain fog. (I feel like I have a brain again!!) I’m a licensed psychotherapist. So I am sensitive to mood changes. I stopped having mood swings around my period. And I realized lots of my patients can also benefit from functional medicine. (although I like to call them my clients, but I want to distinguish my clients from my therapy business and coaching business. ) I want to learn this for my self, my family, and my future coaching clients. I have been doing readings on functional medicine but it really was not enough. So I need to learn in a more systematic way. And I love systems and ways to organize stuff as well as knowledge. I just registered a coaching business, because I know it is good to learn while working under supervision, the same way I got trained as a psychotherapist. I am very excited to start this journey. Btw, I am from China. And functional medicine basically does not exist there. So I also want to be able to bring it to people in China someday.",

Having this knowledge will empower me to make healthier choices and improve my quality of life. Second, I see this course as an opportunity to create additional income. Since my recent separation, I’ve been working overtime at a blood banking job, but despite the long hours, the pay is not enough to cover my needs. I often come home exhausted, and I know I need a path that can provide both financial stability and personal fulfillment. Functional medicine offers me a chance to build a new skill set that can support me professionally while also helping others. This course is not just an educational step, it’s an investment in my health, my future, and my independence.",

My health over the years has been good and bad, my weight vacillating up and down with having children, going through divorce, stress, etc. I became a Certified Nurse Midwife/Nurse Practitioner in 2009 and found so many women suffering and complaining about fatigue, brain fog, stomach issues, weight gain, depression... I am a part of a wellness supplement company that focuses on use of adaptogens and detox support and went through a 30 day detox a few years ago and felt so much better. I have listened to podcasts and love learning how giving your body what it needs, it can be a miracle healing itself. I have been working so hard in a very busy practice and don't get much sleep throughout the week and feel I can't live my life and take time for my family like I need to. I already do a lot of teaching and recommendations to patients in the clinic I work in, however it is an employer situation and I do not have the freedom to say as much as I would like or recommend the supplements these people need. I am about to be 60 and need to convert my income from being employed to owning my own business that I can work from anywhere, help more people, and be able to still pay my bills. I need to help myself through this, and want to truly impact others by getting them on the right tract and prevent chronic disease in their lives. My plans are to obtain the knowledge and certification here, incorporate this into my wellness company with Quantum scan analysis. I am also working on 3-D OB Ultrasound training, and plan to open a boutique practice performing 3-D OB Ultrasounds as well, however that will take money that I do not have at this time. Building my wellness company will help fund the other. I feel that once I open the boutique, I can have a place for in person visits or online, but separate from my home. Both of these are my desire...being able to see my pregnant moms in a fun, happy experience, and helping both men and women get their health back. This is the way I would like to go out :)",

      "content": "Sarah, Where do i start.. I have already shared with you some things about me but that just skimmed the surface. LOL in addition to what i shared initially… I also am a c diff survivor, (not from taking antibiotics, and since i rarely leave my home.. not sure where i contacted it, but also i have a history of chronic gut infections, so who knows.) Always on guard for the next pathogen. Hence one of the reasons why i monitor my gut via Vibrant America labs a few times a year. Their “gut zoomer” test is approx 20+ page report, which gets a bit overwhelming to interpret, but thankfully i have Dr. Betty to assist in reviewing the results. I understand most of it by now though, without much of her help. Been doing them for 10 years. One of several markers i have been working on is butyrate. Finally got my deficient butyrate levels into range last year. It took several years of commitment to fix it, but i kept chiseling away at it and finally succeeded. Just when i was about to throw up the white towel.. my levels reached in range. But still trying to resolve the inflammation and lowered immune markers, that the jabs caused. Persistence is key. 5 years ago, i made the biggest mistake of my life and let “fake news” fear mongers scare me into getting 2 moderna covid shots. It nearly took my life. I am lucky to be alive. Hence why i am still pretty much homebound and still trying to survive and recover every day. It has been the most difficult 5 years of my life. Very isolating situation. But which made me step up my game on my research in attempt to help my body heal. thank God i like to research. LOL.🤓I have learned a tremendous amount and discovered that i am stronger than i think, and given the right tools, our bodies are designed to heal.. Thanks to Our almighty God. The shots did, neurological damage, vascular damage, gut damage, and immune damage, for starters. The remorse i live with every day is a heavy weight to bare. But with the grace of God, i am still here and still hoping for more healing. It also affected my brain, and made my “managable add”, a lot worse. I have good days and bad days with all the above, so some days i have to take mental and physical breaks. So, i am glad to know that there is no timeline to finish the 3 courses i purchased. 🤓 All that said.. This too, is my motivation to help others like myself who have been injured. And believe me.. there are more folks who were damaged than anyone is talking about. My only sister got lymphoma after her 5th booster. Thankfully she caught it pretty early via annual mammogram, and it is in remission currently, but like so many.. she has not connected the dots to the covid shots. No matter how much i preach about it. My 89 year old Mother, is dying, and currently in the hospital after collapsing last week again. (Not surprised since she opted for her 8th booster less than a month ago). She had a stroke in March from taking the shots, and although she was rallying like a champion.. i knew if she opted for another booster, it would be the nail in her coffin. So sad. She was a walker most of her adult life.. walked 2 miles a day until her the stroke. Then had a second stroke a few months ago. Then got another covid booster and now she can’t walk at all. I share this story, to explain how frustrating it is to KNOW what is causing all this damage in people,(that are brainwashed by big pharma docs), and not be “heard” when i shout it from the roof tops to run the other way from the “genocide jabs”. My Mother for example is influenced heavily by her husband (who faithfully gets his flu and covid shots every year ), and influenced by her standard of care Dr’s. Heck.. even though the jabs nearly killed me (her own daughter)..she still chooses to inject the poison anyway. Here we are again at the “no respect” topic. If only i would have persued getting my medical degree, with an MD on my name.. then she MIGHT have listened to my advise. And sadly i doubt she will be alive when i finally get certified health coach status. But even that.. so many people are in denial about the covid shots, that what i say, goes in one ear and out the other.🧐 On a more positive note.lol…I look forward to helping others recover and others live a healthier, happier life. And i hope my story will help others in their healing journey. Most Dr’s just gas light folks like me, more so with the jab injuries, but even before that, because of the complicated nature of my case, with genetic snips etc etc.. So i want to educate and empower others to be their own health advocate, and to have the confidence to do so. I often reflect on the pain and suffering i have endured for the past 5 years, and i can’t help but think, there is a reason i was spared. I strongly feel that it is my responsibly educate others with the knowledge i can share, for anything pertaining longevity and vitality. This nightmare i have lived thru has strengthened me in ways i never knew possible. Even with ongoing health challenges .. i refuse to quit. If i quit.. they win. Talking about longevity.. i am a big fan high quality supplements, to include the use of stacking peptides . I trust Integrative Peptides brand, for oral, sublingual, application. Peptides are amazing. But i need more knowledge on them. It is challenging to gather science backed data on them. Glad to see they are starting to be talked about a little more recently, but wishing i had a reliable source to educate me on peptides more indepth. I know there are a few Dr’s out there using them, few and far between still. Also.. i do testing annually, and recommend it to others, for heavy meta; panels, and what i call “stealth virus panel”. Especially in more complicated cases, such as mine. Lyme testing etc.. The problem with getting others to get their Dr to order these test, is that most Dr’s don’t have clue how to “manage” these complicated topics. I am blessed to of had a very knowledgable functional medicine doc for 14 years. He taught me a lot, to include lots of blood work at least twice a year. I keep track of my “stealth viruses”, and take Valgancyclovir to suppress them. Yes.. on occasion.. big pharma has it’s place. It truly is a great feeling to have the knowledge and tools to address complex health issues, that most Dr’s are not familiar with. Funny story.. I often am sharing info with my current function med doc (semi retired), it is fun to teach my Dr. LOl🤓 He is a super nice person, and always receptive to my input. I dread when he retires because i will never find another Dr. that trust me enough to let me fill out my own lab req’s. 😳. Love it! But he knows i will order way more test than he ever would, so we cover everything he usually runs and a lot more. LOL. Have to schedule extra time with him to review my results, because i order so many. 🤓 Anyway.. enough for now.. your head is probably spinning , so don’t want to overwhelm. But you seem perfectly capable of handling so much info. Hoping i can focus long enough to finish the 3 courses, and get my certs. Question: are there any future “hidden cost” that i should be aware of moving forward. Don’t like surprises. LOL I ask, with all due respect, because of how you have your check out set up, with add on this and that. Just needing transparency thru this certification process. i believe i have filled out everything that you need to proceed with level 1 course. I will likely need you to “hold my hand” thru this process. Do you strictly communicate via e mails? I would guess the answer is yes, since you have so many clients to assist. Looking forward to this next chapter in my life journey, and glad to have you by my side coaching me along the way. Please be patient with me. i have no timeline to finish. And hoping i can pass the exams etc. TBD Kindest Regards",

We got together and formed an idea to open up a functional clinic. Upon looking at all of the information, I just couldn’t take the risk and I had no money to buy the certification to be a health coach. My friend is an APRN and she had the knowledge, the faith and the resources to build her practice. I was her first client and she is now my primary care physician. I have Hashimoto thyroiditis and I have figured out that doctors are stupid and they don’t listen. I have tried to change diets, do food sensitivity tests and all of it and with the help of my friend, I am finally feeling better. BUT…I’m not where I want to be. I am also type II diabetic and there is just so much. I have helped many many friends with complications, but I want to learn and know more. So this is a huge blessing for me. I literally bought everything and it is still less than the lowest price program I have seen. I’m excited to jump in with both feet in January!",

I want to be someone people can put their trust into bc I've had a lot of doctors over the years not seem to care (but maybe their burnt out) or help me or push my \"feelings\" aside -- I think maybe it's called gaslight me. I want to also learn this info for myself to help me get healthier. I struggle immensely with mental health over the last decade and am finally feeling better to take on a task like this and make it flourish into what I need and want it to be. I also plan to get a nutrition certification to assist in my work and offer more help bc the nutrition industry can be consuming. I want to work mostly with women who are in perimenopause and menopause because we should really have more practitioners in that area. Pretty much ready to quit this job but I have no interest in looking for a new job and feel if I can do something on my own, I'll be happier.",

I tried looking for answers and relief in the world of western medicine, only to be pay out thousands of dollars to be told over and over again that \"they didn't know what was causing xyz\", or my favorite was \"you'll just have to live with it\". Every visit to a supposed medical professional/expert, left me with zero answers, less and less trust in Doctors/our sick-care system, and with a deeper burning desire/need to find my own answers + heal myself. The last decade has been a journey of doing just that. I have healed decades worth of chronic shoulder pain, IBS / Severe gastrointestinal issues, hormone imbalances + cycle irregularities, among other things in my body - mostly through intuitive body awareness, deep emotional + energetic healing, holistic practices and lifestyle shifts of course. TRUE heath & wellness have become my passion and I feel it's my mission to help as many people as I can heal their own bodies, and experience true and lasting wellness and vitality! I have a health coaching certification already (since about 5 years ago) but I'm feeling called to go deeper and get more in depth training and education regarding the body and integrative/functional medicine so I can help people on a deeper level (with the credentials to back up what I know).",

I love talking to others and sharing health information. I am getting older and due to stressful living, I have some of my own health issues. My husband is now retiring and I can pursue some education for myself now. I still need to earn a living, but it doesn't have to be huge numbers. I think our health system is broken, and would love to help people navigate their health, working with their own body's God-given ability to heal itself and addressing the cause of the problem, and not just treat symptoms.",

I even lived in Africa for 11 years doing community health and development. However, for about the last 8 years, I’ve grown unhappy with the way we do “healthcare” and have found that it no longer aligns with my values and beliefs. Around 2019, I began to wake up to the realization that our healthcare system is so broken, we don’t cure anything, and people are sicker now more than ever. I want to help people live the way God intended humans to live…healthy, vibrant, happy. I am no longer happy with bedside nursing. I can’t bring myself to do the things to newborns that I’m required to do because it violates my beliefs (vaccines at 1 hour old). Honestly, I’ve already taken a course in functional medicine for nurses. It was good. I just need more help in getting an actually profitable business off the ground as soon as possible. My goal is January. Is that too ambitious? I already have my LLC but have never done anything with it. Too scared? Don’t know where to actually start? Imposter syndrome? Never owned my own business? Yes to all of it. But I’m tired of not taking action. People in my life and my community are asking for this and now is the time to take action.",

It wasn't until after I gave my payment information that I was told that the $97 was only for level 1, which doesn't deal with the more involved cases. One of the main reasons why I'm wanting to do this is that I have a daughter suffering with a pretty debilitating autoimmune disease, and I want to help her in any way I can; and as an RN, I've felt frustrated not being able to really help her, and witnessing doctors dismissing her symptoms. Apparently, I had to spend $397 extra in order to deal with illnesses on that level. I felt this a bit deceptive. But, I went along with it and am praying this whole program isn't a scam. That's how my heart is feeling right now. This played out like a typical marketing ploy that, unfortunately, I am very familiar with. Now, with that off my chest, I will share a little about me that brought me here. I am a BSN nurse of 32 years who has worked in adult cardiac, neonatal intensive care, longterm care, and hospice care. Due to my heart for the elderly, I left hospice to open my own private senior care home. We ran that for 9 yrs and sold a year and a half ago due to staffing issues after COVID. I was working on starting a senior care management business when I started to learn more and more about functional medicine in looking for answers for my daughter. My Mom also suffers with some chronic issues, as well. I'm looking to start a new chapter in using my nursing skills and desire to help people to make a difference.",

Got married then she divorced me 6 years later. Was diagnosed with MDD and had 2 attempts in 2012 when I was 24. And have struggled with depression and SI nonstop. I wanted to be a HS music teacher. And so since I loved teaching merit badges at BSA summer camps, I got into being a paraprofessional. With Autistic students. 2 years in the para position, I was desperate for any relief from the MDD and was on Medi-Cal and was approved for Electroconvulsive Therapy, (ECT … same as in “the one who flew over the cuckoo’s nest”) and did over 60 treatments. Later that year I met my the love of my life (now my wife) and got married once things started opening up after Covid, in 2021. Two years ago I finally made I breakthrough with my SI and started addressing that. Then last year I started my spiritual healing when going through the 3 levels of becoming a prayer Minister. Then This year has been shocking because I found out I have 2 gene mutations with my MTHFR and really want everyone to know about it and the solution with Enlyte and how it is possible and helping me. I love teaching people and love seeing that lightbulb go off in their heads when they understand it. I enjoy helping people and have always been fascinated with the medical field. I have always enjoyed Math and Science. And ELA has been my biggest struggle. Why I chose this because currently working with the current charter school that my job feels boring. (there are a few times where I feel like I get to teach and help a student, though to far separated from each other.) currently I’m getting treatment for MDD / treatment resistant depression with an integrated Treatment Doctor and am fascinated by her approach and how much it has helped me in this short 5 months vs. the 13 years from 2012-2025. Hopefully this gives a good snapshot of me. I also am a husband and Father of 5 kids (15,13,11,5,3.5 years old) I also married into the 3 older boys. So my life is chaotic with lots to do and not enough time.",

Earned my RN in 2013 (36 yo), then in 2014, God said I would have a Global Dementia Biz - that Freaked me out!!! I worried about licenses and buildings and international laws, and it caused A-fib one night actually, for about 15 minutes, until I used breathwork to revert back to the parasympathic nervous system. A telehealth nurse said I should have a full cardiac workup and that I was putting my life in danger by not going to the ER. That infuriated me. I know how to handle my body, I was just overwhelmed with God's vision. This was all before Online Courses and Coaching was popular. In 2022, I finally figured out how to create and online course, with Kajabi, and recorded videos and learned how to write an eBook (all without AI...lol) for my \"Decrease Dementia - Naturally and without pharmaceuticals\". I had been researching holistic/whole body health, like they teach in RN school, and truly fell in love with teaching people about reducing the chronic inflammation in their body to reverse and prevent: dementia (type 3 diabetes now), diabetes, congestive heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and alllllll the side effects of those major diseases - all due to inflammation and adrenal fatigue. (tried to promote my course on YouTube and Instagram, not a single client or eBook sale yet. So, I inform the church ladies and they listen, but don't apply - so I knew I needed to learn how to coach effectively for transformation and to have the patient want to do this, instead of have to do this. I've been praying in November of 2025 - what God wants me to do, since I was not able to make any of these business ideas work. Then your $97 ad came up on Instagram - thank you Sarah and God!!! Finally, a course where I can get the certifications (even International - so I can have a Global Business, like God said!!!) and the Coaching Training - to learn How to be an effective coach for client's transformation (what I had been looking for!), and the business skills - set up, Bookkeeping, Legal for scope of practice, and how to market, scale, and exit - this is an Extraordinary Course!!!! Others only sell pieces of this for $2000-$8000 - none of which I could afford, since I have no credit cards with my Bankruptcy. I am truly blown away by your course - I've opened all the modules to see the section titles, and I'm so blown away. This is what I've been looking for!!! Thank you soooo much Sarah!!!",

More recently, I’ve moved closer to the integration of mental health and behavioral health, and I see how critical this is for whole-person care. Investing in this certification felt right because it aligns with my lifelong commitment to making a tangible difference in people’s lives. It’s not just about advancing my career; it’s about equipping myself with the tools to serve patients more fully, with compassion, evidence, and impact. I am also on my way to completing my PMHNP, expect to graduate early in 2027.",

I believe this program can bridge the disconnect. This program seems to be just what I have been searching for (for a long time), that will help me feel like I'm helping my patients, rather than just throwing pills, ordered by doctors who may not even have listened closely enough to get it right, at my patients.

      "content": "All my life I’ve always wanted to be a doctor, particularly a surgeon what time and money lead me to take prerequisites for nursing instead. I completed my prerequisites and received an associates of arts in 2007 and was on the nursing program waitlist at the time I was living back in Michigan, which is where my family is originally from but I moved back to Arizona joined a nursing program waitlist and then in 2010 I moved to California and also joined a nursing program waitlist. In 2015 I moved back to Arizona to help my parents care for my grandmother who suffered from dementia, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. I joined a nursing waiting program again when I moved back. Job wise in between these times I was and still in a licensed cosmetologist and like the Salon being my mother owned one and also was an insurance I’ve done both property and casualty and in most recent years life and health selling Medicare but none of these jobs are fulfilling for me. I still have always wanted to be in the medical. It took a course starting on clinical research to finally start with the Pima medical Institute nursing program in September 2020. However, from the little had already learned from my clinical research class I knew the way things were being handled during Covid were unethical. I had started having more interest and coming across more of those into holistic practices, which definitely aligns more with desire of helping people to be able to get to the root of the problem. I truly feel our medical system. Here has failed many and is greedy in our adjusting to managing and having sick care. Don’t get me wrong definitely we do need telepathic medicine sometimes, but I truly want to help people by getting to the root cause of the issues and also because so many people in my family have been hurt through medical malpractice. I have two beautiful nephews who turned autistic after two I have another one who had H5. A doctor ripped off all of his toenails because he said he had a fungus when he didn’t, and now he has severe psoriasis on his feet & legs. My mother has always had a edema in her legs and weeklong who catches pneumonia like a cold. My father, who has always been a perfect picture of health, but during Covid times and the fear mongering the way things represented in the media. He was always click to roll the sleeves and get every shot and booster and now all of a sudden, I don’t know where he has a heart problem and they were unsure if he would live Pass the next two years, but he did respond well to medication and they said he’s a poster child but now my father, who’s never had to be on medication for anything is on medication right now for life and I really don’t feel he needs to be. I myself have PCOS and I have a friend who was in NATURAL PATH, who has helped me and getting my period back regulated so that my husband and I can realize our dream of becoming parents in the near future hopefully. I have a uncle who’s had diabetes and cancer and Aunt with MS that came out of nowhere. and as time has gone on, I do know a lot of things go back to parasites. Besides all these medical issues that I have seen personally touch my family even within the African-American community autism is now an epidemic and that’s not coincidental. Literally every family within my circle that has a son that is two years old that was on the American vaccine schedule ended up being autistic after their two year-old vaccines and it is just truly heartbreaking seeing families trying to navigate And get assistance that they need from a healthcare system that has failed them . These are the things that drive me to want to assist others. This is my Y really wanting to help my family and others get rid of these terrible issues once and for all or at least get it to a place where they can manage and be functional. My nephews are definitely a prime concern for me. I am grateful that my family have tried things that I have just learned throughout the years through personal research of things to do and we have seen some improvements, but it is my mission to get down to the bottom of this and help my babies be able to be functioning members of society by helping them heal their gut… I also didn’t end up starting the nursing program that I was accepted to in September 2020 because at the time I did not want to be forced to take a vaccine nor be in a mass 12+ hours a day I felt there were other ways. There were no improving natural ways, but without side effects that have helped people beat Covid. If that was something I was going to even catch, and I was confident at the naturopathic protocols of an illness that only had a .01% death rate.. I did unfortunately have to get the vaccine though to be able to travel so in November 2021 I caved and I went into the office bawling my eyes out because I did not want to take it and they had to watch me for 30 minutes after giving it to me because the left side of my face started to numb up For about five minutes after they gave me the J&J shot. I did follow some protocols. I came across from some natural communities and I do know a couple of naturopathic doctors and nurses to try and help get rid of some of that stuff for my sister…. In May 2023 I’m at the love of my life and have been living over in West Africa, traveling back-and-forth between the states, but the first seven months of my marriage when me and my husband temporarily stayed in Ghana before returning to his homeland, Nigeria, I started having issues with my cycle And I had diarrhea for six months straight. Thanks for the help of my friend who is a holistic nurse practitioner I realize, and I was heavenly infested with parasites, and so I started doing some cleanses, but it has really disrupted my gut of which I am still working with, but it has improved so and things finally seem to be getting back on track after two years, so I’m really hoping to be able to become a mother and get pregnant in 2026 as these issues have definitely affected my Fertility. I still am currently back-and-forth between the United States of Nigeria due to the ridiculous immigration system here going on 2 1/2 years still waiting. So I come back work a little bit then go back to Nigeria so I really wanna take this time while I’m back in Nigeria to focus completely on my holistic courses because I love being able to work remote and help people to achieve results from any corner of the world….So that’s just a little bit about me and my whys. Sorry I know it’s a long read, but I am so excited to be able to do something that I truly believe I have a calling for. I look forward to meeting you or speaking with you one of these days in the near future Sarah.",

I felt it was a great certification that ad to my current bio and would support my work tremendously. I have a life time passion of helping people live a healthier, more harmonious life. My dedication to this passion began at age 16 when I began my nursing career. It was things i noticed about the way patients were not getting better, and when 4 patient in the same room had the same diagnosis on the same treatment yet they did not fully recover. I was intrigued and when an opportunity to be a seniour scrub nurse in the operating theatres presented itself I jumped at it. i wanted to know what we look like inside and what disease looks like. It was a profound experience in with a patient that changed my acceptance of sickness and disease. We opened her up to remove an abdominal tumour, when we got to the augmentum it was grey and lumpy. The surgeon said \"Suture up\" we had not done anything. he saw my quizzical look and said \"Well nurse, you can see the same as me. This lady has 14 days to live\" he asked that I go with him to deliver the news, which to this day is not protocol. She was not fully conscious when we went to her bedside. He spoke to her, she smiled until he said \"When you are awake I want your husband to take you home. In 8 days you will return to the hospital as you will be very unwell. Enjoy the days at home with your family. You have 14 days to live\" We walked away leaving her in tears. On the 8th day I admitted her to the ward, she was very unwell. I laid her out on the 14th day. I cried as I did and I made a pledge to her, I wanted her life to mean more than \"14 days\" I said I would go on a quest to know more of what is illness, disease and dying is, in her honour. And I have been on that quest for over 36 years. I have a natural ability to see into the body and energy fields like an MRI machine only I am more precise. The different studies/certificates I have done have provided a foundation that I unite with that natural ability for me to help clients. I am thrilled and deeply grateful to take up this course with you Sarah.",

However, just to take my word for it and not have \"facts, figures, data\" to back it up what I \"say\" it falls flat and nothing happens. Mean time I am a busy girl so if you want it, you will have to actively seek me out. I am over trying to convince anyone of a better method. Too many times I hear, my insurance covers it so I will go this other route. Overall in would say I am in excellent health and over 60 people usually think I am in my 40's. Plus I have a lot of energy, more than most. And I have many people I know with various health issues that I would like to help.",

Now my children are grown ups, and I try to find a job since 5 years now, with absolutely no success. Ageism is a thing in Switzerland, which I was not aware of but I can see that now.

I've considered taking personal training qualifications and moving towards supporting people with optimizing mobility but I've been putting that off for over 2 years. I guess that was the Universe telling me something more effective was on its way. The variety of specialist options intrigues me and I know the investment is worth just wanting to fix things for myself. From my over 4 years as a meditation and breathwork facilitator and my interest in finding root causes to better understand myself and others my curiosity can be a little insatiable but I truly feel this is the \"title\" I've been desiring.",

      "content": "Honestly, I became aware of functional medicine a few years ago, when my husband and I were drinking heavily and both experiencing health issues. I had gained about 30 lbs, had no energy, and eventually had a stroke-like migraine followed by an intense catharsis, deep crying. My husband was at least 70lbs over weight, and suffered with arthritis, chronic inflammation and stress, as well as intense muscle cramps. I found us a functional medicine practitioner and she changed our lives. We lost all the weight, gained all the energy, most of our symptoms disappeared, quit drinking, and life became fun and manageable again. I've always been excited about science and became even more passionate about biochemistry during the rollout of covid and the vaccines along with our learning and healing journey with our practitioner. I've always loved helping people and feeling my best, but it hasn't been something I've been able to stick to easily. My husband and I did (and still do) tremendous research into world affairs such as the bio-cyber interface, digital ID's and digital prisons, the inhumane \"health\" care system, government corruption, power hungry corporations etc. While I feel it's extremely important to stay abreast of what's transpiring on our planet and to all of us as humans, I became stuck in a really dark depression and overall anxiety in dealing with the world and being a part of it, so I turned to drinking yet again. My husband and I eventually separated because things got so bad between us, and both of us fell back into ill health all the way around. Functional Medicine is my calling, I can feel it in my heart. I believe the best way for me to live is empowered by the changes I can make in my own life, and to assist others in defending their health and their rights. I'm proud to say I have 2 months sober, just landed a full time job at a holistic animal vet, and am finally taking the wisdom I already have and applying it to myself again. I'm feeling energized, motivated, clear headed, and losing weight. I absolutely love learning about the human body and biochemistry, and I'm more excited than I've ever been about starting my own business and creating a life of time and financial freedom. I love that your course incorporates all aspects of this, and I'm truly excited to be learning with you!",

I took all my prerequisites and received my associates of arts degree while being put on eternal waitlist for the programs since 2007. I had moved back to Arizona from Michigan to California and back to Arizona again From 2008-2023. Of Course I joined the waitlist whenever I moved. I had moved from Cali back to Arizona in 2015 to help my parents in caregiving for my grandmother that suffered from Parkinson's, Alzheimers and Dementia heart breaking to watch her deteriorate. I peered into other medical career options as well such as clinical research. I took a brief course on that which really helped raise my antennas when covid came on the scene. I very quick realized the game being played and how unethically things were being handled. Over the years I noticed how they try to discredit or keep hidden those helping people heal naturally since of course big Pharma doesn't want to get to the root. Don't get me wrong there are absolutely times when we need allopathic care but the healthcare system here in America is driven by greed instead of really helping people. I've seen this too many times and with medical Mal practiced that has happened to my close family members. I had 2 nephews that went autistic around 2 years of age post vaccines. As an African American woman I have seen this in our community with those who have sons that were on todays vaccine schedule which has at least doubled since the 80's. It's an epidemic within the black community and its heart breaking seeing the families of such ones navigate to get healing for a system that has failed them. a seem this in pretty much ever In Sept of 2020 I was finally supposed to start a nursing course at Pima medical institute However the way covid was being handled and the vaccines they were forcing people to take didn't sit with well me, nor did being in a mask 12+ hours a day if I declined the vaccine. I realized the terrible state our healthcare is in and know I will have to serve my purpose of helping people to heal in a natural way. So many have been failed by the system that more and more people are looking for an alternative route. With the rising cost of premiums and medications I believe people will have no choice but to return to the natural route and want tube able to be a part of that change and make a true difference. Cant wait to get started. Looking forward to meeting or speaking with you.",

      "content": "Hi Sarah :) Honestly, I am 47 years old and I am a healer by nature and find immense joy in helping people live their best quality of life, but in the last couple years I have felt more drained than joyous. I'm going through perimenopause, raising a teen that deals with some huge life struggles, cared for a sick parent for 2 years before he passed a year ago this last Monday, worrying about a mother whose now alone and too far from me to watch over.......and running a full time business that feels like its sucking the life out of my husband and I. Kind of wondering what door Joy left from? lol. I used to do one on one sessions with Nutrition clients, and I loved it but there were two issues, one is that I couldn't earn what I needed to support our family and lifestyle, and two.....although I believe nutrition is so important, I wished I could offer people more. My husband and I happened to get involved with an amazing health technology 10 years ago that led to a career in sales. Very rewarding as I was helping people while also being rewarded financially. Unfortunately, that job we had created has taken a turn and is no longer feeling the same and certainly is not producing the same financial freedom as it was. It's been two years of feeling drained and not feeling less secure financially. I want to return to my work with clients but in a wy that allows me more time with my family and supports me financially. I saw your program for a few months and it just resonated with me and so here I am :) I am ready to work smarter and really enjoy my job, find my joy again......and makes some money doing it!!! lol. This won't be shared anywhere will it? lol. As I was writing, I thought I really hope this is just a private convo . lol. Looking forward to I'm doing this part time so might take a little longer than others.",

As you can guess, my work always starts with the mom or grandmom – they want to help their kids, but they need to help themselves first. I am a bit of a neuroscience geek, so I always use science-backed facts in my methods, including some NLP. My work has pivoted due to need and my own passion, to teaching these moms how to teach their kids to use AI safely with EI and EF, so they can feel secure that they are Future Ready. The first problem is that they are not ready to help their kids. Some realize this, others are resistant to say the least. I want to feel more qualified to guide them. My passion for this comes from my personal experience. I struggled for many years with ignoring my own feelings and instincts to go with the flow. This led me to literally waste years going through the motions until I finally woke up and realized that I was not living my life, I was merely surviving. I don't want others to have to waste years when they don't have to.",
