Sarah Mitchell - Your Personal Mentor
Hi, I'm Sarah - Your Personal Mentor 💕
Let's take a breath and figure this out together. I've been exactly where you are — staring at lab results you don't fully understand, feeling frustrated when clients have complex health issues beyond basic nutrition advice, wondering if you'll ever have the confidence to work with hormone imbalances or autoimmune conditions.

Twenty years ago, I was a basic health coach giving the same generic advice everyone else gave: "eat more vegetables, drink more water, reduce stress." And you know what? My clients stayed sick.

That changed when I discovered functional medicine — the systematic approach to finding root causes instead of managing symptoms. Suddenly I could help clients who'd been struggling for years because I finally understood how to connect the dots between their gut, hormones, thyroid, and chronic symptoms.

Here's what I know for sure after training 1247 coaches:

Your desire to help people goes deeper than surface-level wellness tips
You're tired of referring out every complex case because you don't have the clinical depth
You CAN master functional medicine principles without going back to school for 4+ years
Clients WILL pay $75-200/hour when you can solve problems other coaches can't
Working 15-20 hours a week from home is completely possible with the right clinical skills
My promise: I'll personally walk beside you through every step of this certification. Daily check-ins. Answering your questions. Reviewing your practice cases. Celebrating when you interpret your first thyroid panel or design your first gut healing protocol. You'll never feel alone or overwhelmed.

This isn't just about certification. It's about becoming the practitioner who can finally give clients the root cause answers they've been desperately seeking. Let's do this together. 🌿

The Client Who Changed Everything (And Why Basic Health Coaching Isn't Enough)
Last month, Jennifer (one of my students) texted our community group:

"I just got off a call with a client who's been to 6 doctors in 2 years. Her thyroid numbers are 'normal' but she's exhausted, gaining weight, losing hair. I KNEW what to look for in her labs because of your training. We found subclinical hypothyroidism everyone else missed. She cried happy tears. THIS is why I became a coach."

But let me tell you how we BOTH got here...

When "Eat Better and Exercise" Stopped Working
Eight years ago, I had a client named Rebecca. She came to me after gaining 40 pounds in one year despite "doing everything right."

I gave her what I'd been trained to give:

"Cut processed foods and sugar."
"Try meal prepping on Sundays."
"Walk 30 minutes daily."
"Reduce stress with meditation."
She did ALL of it. For three months. And gained 5 more pounds.

I felt like a fraud. She'd trusted me with her health and I had nothing else to offer.

The Day Everything Changed
Rebecca showed me her recent bloodwork. Her doctor said "everything looks fine" but I noticed something odd — her TSH was 3.8 (within "normal" range of 0.5-5.0).

I didn't know then what I know now: functional ranges are different from standard lab ranges.

Out of desperation, I called a functional medicine doctor friend. She looked at Rebecca's labs and said:

"Her TSH is technically normal but functionally elevated. Plus her reverse T3 is high and her ferritin is low. This is textbook subclinical hypothyroidism with poor thyroid conversion. No wonder she can't lose weight — her metabolism is crawling."

I had NO IDEA what any of that meant.

The Moment I Realized I Needed Real Training
That conversation haunted me. I'd been giving Rebecca generic wellness advice while her REAL problem was a dysfunctional thyroid that everyone missed because they only looked at TSH.

I started researching functional medicine. The more I learned, the more I realized:

"I've been treating symptoms while completely missing root causes. My clients deserve better. I need to learn how to ACTUALLY help them — not just give them meal plans and motivational quotes."

That's when I committed to becoming a REAL functional medicine practitioner.

What Actually Works: The DEPTH Method™ For Root Cause Analysis
The Framework That Changed My Practice
After spending years (and tens of thousands of dollars) on functional medicine training, I discovered something crucial:

Most health coaches fail with complex cases because they skip critical steps:

They don't know HOW to systematically assess clients beyond basic intake forms
They can't interpret functional labs or understand optimal ranges
They miss connections between gut dysfunction, hormone imbalances, and chronic symptoms
They give generic protocols instead of personalized, root-cause interventions
They don't know how to monitor progress or adjust protocols when something isn't working
That's why I created the DEPTH Method™ — a systematic approach to functional medicine coaching that gives you clinical confidence without requiring you to become a doctor.

The Transformation Was Immediate
Once I started using this framework:

I could confidently assess clients and spot red flags other coaches missed
I learned to interpret thyroid panels, gut tests, hormone labs, and more
I understood how to connect symptoms across body systems (gut-brain-hormone axis)
I designed evidence-based protocols that actually got results
I could handle autoimmune conditions, chronic fatigue, and complex cases
But here's what shocked me most:

Clients started SEEKING ME OUT specifically. They'd say: "My doctor said my labs are normal but I feel terrible. Can you look at them?"

That's when I realized: This systematic approach is what separates wellness coaches from functional medicine practitioners. And I could teach it.

From Frustrated Coach to Functional Medicine Expert: Your Path Forward
Why Generic Health Coaching Is Failing Your Clients
As I started helping more coaches make this transformation, I saw the same pattern everywhere:

❌ The Problem:

Basic health coach training teaches meal planning and lifestyle habits
But doesn't teach lab interpretation, systems analysis, or clinical reasoning
Coaches feel stuck referring out thyroid issues, gut problems, hormone imbalances
Clients with complex cases get generic advice that doesn't address root causes
Coaches can't command premium fees because they lack specialized clinical depth
✅ What Clients Actually Need:

Someone who can interpret their "normal" labs and spot subclinical dysfunction
Root cause analysis that connects gut health to brain fog to hormone problems
Evidence-based protocols for autoimmune conditions, thyroid dysfunction, chronic fatigue
A practitioner who understands HOW to sequence healing (gut first, then detox, etc.)
Systematic progress monitoring and protocol adjustments
The Clients Who Are Desperately Searching For You
Every week I hear stories like:

"I've seen 8 doctors. They all say my labs are fine but I'm exhausted, can't lose weight, and my hair is falling out."

"My doctor wants to put me on antidepressants but I KNOW something else is wrong. Can you help me figure out what's really going on?"

"I've spent $10,000 on supplements that didn't work because nobody actually tested what I needed."

These clients don't need another nutritionist telling them to eat more vegetables. They need a functional medicine coach who can find root causes.

That's Why I Created the DEPTH Method™
A systematic framework that transforms health coaches into functional medicine practitioners:

D - Discover: Master comprehensive client assessment, intake systems, and clinical questioning that reveals what traditional health history forms miss

E - Evaluate: Learn to confidently interpret functional labs — thyroid panels, gut tests, hormone workups, nutrient markers — using optimal ranges, not just "normal"

P - Pinpoint: Develop systems thinking to connect symptoms across body systems and identify root causes using the functional medicine matrix

T - Transform: Design evidence-based protocols for therapeutic nutrition, targeted supplementation, detox support, and complex cases like autoimmune conditions

H - Heal: Implement sophisticated progress monitoring, protocol refinement, and the psychology of lasting behavior change

This isn't theory. This is the exact framework I use with every client — and what I've taught 1,247+ coaches who now confidently handle complex cases.

The Part Where I Get Real With You
Listen. Somewhere right now, a client is sitting in their doctor's office being told "your labs are normal" even though they're exhausted, gaining weight, and losing hair.

A health coach is staring at thyroid results they don't understand, wishing they could help instead of just saying "ask your doctor."

A nutritionist is giving their 47th client the same generic meal plan, knowing it won't address their gut dysfunction or hormone imbalances.

A wellness practitioner is about to refer out another complex case because they don't have the clinical depth to handle it themselves.

They need YOU. The version of you who has systematic frameworks for root cause analysis.

Not surface-level wellness advice. Not generic meal plans.

The clinical depth to interpret labs, identify root causes, design evidence-based protocols, and solve complex cases that transform lives.

You know you're meant for deeper work than basic health coaching.

When do you finally give yourself permission to become the practitioner you're capable of being?

Picture This...
Tomorrow morning: You wake up knowing you FINALLY invested in clinical-depth functional medicine training.

Next week: You're learning the DEPTH Method™, interpreting your first thyroid panel, feeling capable and excited.

Next month: You're certified, confidently discussing lab results with clients, designing evidence-based protocols.

Three months: You have 8 regular clients at $125/hour. They're getting results doctors couldn't achieve because you found root causes.

Next year: You're the functional medicine coach people wait months to see. The practitioner doctors refer to. The specialist in your community.

P.S. - Let's Take a Breath and Figure This Out Together
I almost didn't create this program. I thought, "Who am I to teach functional medicine? I'm not a doctor. Maybe I'm not qualified."

Then Jennifer sent me a screenshot. A client's thyroid labs that three doctors said were "normal" — but Jennifer spotted the subclinical hypothyroidism using what I taught her.

The caption: "She's been exhausted for 2 years. Finally someone actually LOOKED at her numbers. Thank you for teaching me to see what others miss."

That's when I remembered: Clients don't need more doctors telling them everything's fine when they feel terrible. They need practitioners who understand functional ranges, root causes, and systematic analysis.

You deserve to do this work confidently. Clients deserve your clinical depth and root-cause focus.

P.P.S. - Join Our Community Today

One Last Thing (I Promise)
There's a client out there right now.

They just left another doctor who dismissed their concerns about fatigue, weight gain, brain fog.

They're exhausted. Their lab results say "normal" but they feel terrible.

They need someone who understands functional medicine and root cause analysis.

They need YOU. The version of you who learned the DEPTH Method™.
