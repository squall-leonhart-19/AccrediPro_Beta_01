                "The supervisor and practitioner using the exact same somatic tools simultaneously.",
                "When the dynamics occurring between the practitioner and client are unconsciously mirrored in the relationship between the supervisor and practitioner.",
                "A requirement that the supervisor sees the same client as the practitioner to ensure accuracy.",
                "The process of aligning the practitioner's breathing rate with the supervisor's breathing rate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel process is a clinical phenomenon where the relational dynamics, emotional states, or 'stuckness' of the client-practitioner relationship manifest within the supervision session itself, providing valuable diagnostic data."

            "question": "A supervisor notices a sudden, sharp constriction in their own chest while a practitioner describes a client's history of domestic 'walk-on-eggshells' environment. This is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic countertransference occurs when the supervisor physically feels the physiological states or 'somatic markers' of the client's trauma or the practitioner's reaction to it through resonance."

            "id": "q25_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The inherent power imbalance in mentorship can lead practitioners to ignore their own somatic 'gut' feelings in favor of following the mentor's directives, which stunts the development of practitioner intuition."

                "It allows the supervisor to take a break while the group talks.",
                "It creates a 'larger container' that can hold and process more intense traumatic material than an individual session.",
                "It reduces the cost of supervision for the practitioner.",
                "It ensures that everyone in the group has the same political views on trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group supervision leverages the combined nervous systems of multiple practitioners to create a more robust 'relational container,' facilitating the processing of high-charge cases through co-regulation."

                "The practitioner's ability to recite the names of all 12 cranial nerves."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic competency is measured by 'embodied presence' and the ability to remain regulated (the 'Window of Tolerance') during high-arousal client states, rather than just academic knowledge or years of experience."

                "A legal term for the supervisor's liability in a malpractice suit."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vicarious resilience is the 'flip side' of vicarious trauma; it is the inspiration and empowerment a supervisor gains from seeing the human capacity for healing and recovery."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "In a Case Review, a practitioner reports feeling 'bored' and 'sleepy' every time a specific client talks about their childhood. As a supervisor, you should first explore this as:",
            "options": [
                "A lack of sleep on the practitioner's part.",
                "A somatic marker of 'Functional Freeze' or dissociation being projected by the client.",
                "A sign that the client is cured and there is nothing left to work on.",
                "The practitioner's lack of interest in developmental trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In somatic work, practitioner boredom or sleepiness is often a countertransferential response to a client's dorsal vagal (freeze/shutdown) state or a dissociative defense mechanism."

                "Avoiding all social contact with the practitioner.",
                "Maintaining clear 'Role Clarity' and discussing how dual dynamics (e.g., being both a supervisor and a colleague) will be managed.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In somatic communities, dual relationships are often unavoidable. The ethical priority is 'Role Clarity'—explicitly naming and navigating the different roles to prevent power abuses or boundary blurring."
