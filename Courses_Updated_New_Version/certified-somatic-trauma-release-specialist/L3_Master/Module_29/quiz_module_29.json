            "id": "q29_1",
            "question": "In the context of Master-Level Integration (L1), which neurobiological shift is most indicative of successful trauma resolution?",
            "options": [
                "Increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system during recall",
                "Enhanced functional connectivity between the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) and the Amygdala",
                "Complete suppression of the Limbic System's response to triggers",
                "A shift from Right-Brain dominance to Left-Brain dominance during somatic processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level integration is characterized by 'top-down' modulation, where the mPFC effectively regulates the amygdala, allowing for emotional processing without flooding."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "During Advanced Titration (L2), what is the primary clinical indicator that a client is nearing their 'Pendulation Threshold'?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to describe a vivid narrative of the trauma",
                "A sudden increase in heart rate variability (HRV) and deep breathing",
                "A loss of 'Dual Awareness' where the client becomes fully consumed by the somatic sensation",
                "The appearance of minor motor tremors in the extremities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dual awareness is the hallmark of safe integration; losing the connection to the 'here and now' indicates the titration has failed and the client is moving into re-traumatization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "The R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Framework™ is described as 'Non-Linear' (L3). How should a Master Practitioner apply this in session?",
            "options": [
                "By strictly following the steps from R to E in every single session",
                "By skipping the 'Establish' phase if the client seems ready for 'Release'",
                "By fluidly cycling between phases based on the client's real-time somatic feedback and nervous system capacity",
                "By focusing exclusively on the 'Somatic' phase to ensure physical discharge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves the ability to synthesize the framework non-linearly, recognizing that integration often requires returning to 'Establish' or 'Listen' even during a 'Release' phase."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "When working with Pre-Verbal or Developmental Trauma imprints (L4), why is 'Right-Brain to Right-Brain' communication essential?",
            "options": [
                "Because pre-verbal trauma is stored in the Left-Brain's Broca’s area",
                "Because these imprints were formed before the development of linear language and are stored as implicit, somatic memories",
                "Because the Right-Brain is responsible for logical sequencing of events",
                "Because the practitioner must use complex metaphors to reach the client's subconscious"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pre-verbal trauma is stored in implicit memory systems (Right-Brain/Limbic) that lack a narrative structure, requiring a somatic, prosodic, and relational approach rather than a cognitive one."

            "options": [
                "The total absence of any future triggering or somatic activation",
                "A return to the client's exact level of functioning prior to the trauma",
                "The development of new perspectives, increased personal strength, and a deeper sense of meaning that exceeds the pre-trauma baseline",
                "The client's ability to forget the traumatic event entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PTG is defined by growth that takes the individual beyond their previous baseline, involving a fundamental shift in schema and resilience."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "Which mechanism is primarily responsible for the transmission of Transgenerational Trauma (L6) at a biological level?",
            "options": [
                "Spontaneous genetic mutations in the DNA sequence",
                "Epigenetic 'tags' such as DNA methylation that alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence",
                "Direct memory transfer through mitochondrial DNA",
                "The conscious storytelling of family history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics explains how environmental stress and trauma can leave 'tags' on the genome that influence how genes are expressed in subsequent generations."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is the practitioner's 'Self-Regulation Capacity' (SRC) primarily used for during a high-intensity release?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress the practitioner's own emotions so they remain a 'blank slate'",
                "To provide a stable 'Limbic Anchor' that the client's nervous system can co-regulate with",
                "To analyze the client's movements for diagnostic coding",
                "To ensure the practitioner does not feel any empathy for the client's pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The practitioner's SRC allows them to remain grounded and regulated, providing a safe container and a 'biological model' for the client's nervous system to follow via co-regulation."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "In Master Case Conceptualization (L8), a 'Longitudinal Integration' plan should prioritize which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Rapidly clearing as many traumatic memories as possible in the shortest time",
                "Tracking the client's increasing ability to self-titrate and return to a Ventral Vagal state independently",
                "Ensuring the client remains in a state of high-arousal to 'burn out' the trauma",
                "Focusing exclusively on the client's childhood history while ignoring current symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal success is measured by the client's 'Integration Maturity'—their growing capacity to manage their own nervous system states and maintain stability over time."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Global High Intensity Activation' but no clear memory of a trauma. Based on Module 29, this most likely represents:",
            "options": [
                "A lack of motivation for the somatic process",
                "A transgenerational or pre-verbal imprint stored in implicit memory",
                "A typical sympathetic response to a recent minor stressor",
                "A cognitive refusal to engage with the R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Framework™"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High activation without narrative (L4 & L6) is a classic sign of trauma that occurred before language development or was inherited through ancestral patterns."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "Ethical Mastery (L7) suggests that 'Countertransference' in somatic work is:",
            "options": [
                "A sign of practitioner incompetence that should be avoided at all costs",
                "Purely a psychological phenomenon with no somatic basis",
                "Valuable 'Somatic Information' that can be used to understand the client's unspoken internal state, provided the practitioner remains regulated",
                "Only relevant when working with developmental trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In somatic mastery, the practitioner uses their own body as a resonant instrument. Somatic countertransference provides deep insights into the client’s state if the practitioner has the SRC to process it."
