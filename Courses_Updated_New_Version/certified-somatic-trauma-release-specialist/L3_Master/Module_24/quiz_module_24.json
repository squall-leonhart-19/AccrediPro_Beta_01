            "question": "In the context of Somatic Resonance (L1), what is the primary neurobiological mechanism that allows a Master Practitioner to 'track' a client's internal state through their own body?",
            "options": [
                "The activation of the Prefrontal Cortex to analyze facial expressions",
                "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS) and the Insula providing interoceptive maps",
                "The sympathetic nervous system's 'fight' response",
                "Cognitive empathy derived from narrative history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners utilize the Mirror Neuron System and the Insula to create a 'somatic echo' of the client's state, allowing for intuitive tracking through their own interoceptive experience."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "When navigating 'High-Intensity Survival Energy' (L2), what is the primary indicator that titration is not precise enough?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to cry softly",
                "The client reports feeling 'relaxed' but looks pale",
                "The client experiences 'flooding' or rapid movement into a dissociative 'freeze' state",
                "The client asks to stop the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Precision titration aims to keep the client at the 'growing edge' of their window of tolerance. Flooding or a sudden drop into freeze indicates the titration was too large, overwhelming the nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A practitioner suddenly feels a sharp, localized pain in their solar plexus while a client describes a childhood memory. According to L3, how should a Master Practitioner first utilize this 'Somatic Countertransference'?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately tell the client they are causing the practitioner pain",
                "Ignore the sensation as it is likely the practitioner's own unrelated issue",
                "Use it as an internal 'compass' to hypothesize about the client's unspoken somatic experience while maintaining boundaries",
                "End the session to seek supervision for their own trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic countertransference acts as an internal compass. The practitioner tracks the sensation internally to gain insight into the client's field without prematurely projecting it back onto the client."

        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "Why does pre-verbal trauma (L4) typically manifest as 'global' somatic states rather than specific narrative memories?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client is choosing to repress the memories",
                "Because the hippocampus (responsible for narrative memory) is not yet fully developed in early infancy",
                "Because pre-verbal trauma is less significant than adult trauma",
                "Because infants do not have a nervous system capable of recording stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma occurring before age 2-3 (pre-verbal) is stored as 'implicit' memory. Since the hippocampus is not fully online, these experiences lack narrative structure and manifest as global body sensations or 'felt senses'."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "During a session, a client's index finger begins to twitch rhythmically. According to the study of Micro-Movements (L5), this likely represents:",
            "options": [
                "A sign of neurological disorder that requires medical referral",
                "A 'thwarted' or truncated motor pattern attempting to complete its discharge",
                "A conscious attempt by the client to get attention",
                "General muscle fatigue from sitting still"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-movements are often the 'seeds' of larger survival actions (like pushing away or running) that were frozen during the original trauma. Allowing these to complete slowly facilitates discharge."

        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "In the Theory of Structural Dissociation (L6), what is the primary function of the 'Apparently Normal Part' (ANP)?",
            "options": [
                "To hold the intense emotions and sensory memories of the trauma",
                "To sabotage the therapeutic process",
                "To handle the tasks of daily living and avoid the intrusion of traumatic memories",
                "To facilitate the final discharge of survival energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ANP is the part of the personality dedicated to 'getting on with life.' It typically avoids traumatic triggers and may be phobic of the 'Emotional Parts' (EPs) that carry the trauma."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of 'Somatic Inquiry' (L7) that bypasses the cognitive mind?",
            "options": [
                "'Why do you think your mother treated you that way?'",
                "'Can you explain the logic behind your anxiety?'",
                "'As you notice that tightness in your chest, what is its texture or temperature?'",
                "'How long have you felt this way about your job?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic inquiry focuses on the 'How' and the direct sensory experience (texture, temperature, shape) rather than the 'Why' or the narrative story."

        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "According to L8, 'Master Presence' is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner being perfectly calm and never feeling the client's distress",
                "Maintaining a 'Holding Environment' that is both regulated and deeply attuned to the client's shifts",
                "Providing the client with all the answers to their problems",
                "Using complex technical jargon to establish authority"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Presence involves creating a safe, regulated 'holding environment' where the practitioner's nervous system acts as a co-regulator for the client's exploration."

        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client in a session begins to shake violently after touching upon a high-intensity memory. A Master Practitioner (L2/L5) should:",
            "options": [
                "Immediately tell the client to stop shaking to prevent re-traumatization",
                "Encourage the client to shake harder to 'get it all out' quickly",
                "Slow the process down, asking the client to notice the edges of the shaking to ensure it remains a 'controlled' discharge",
                "Leave the room to give the client privacy for their release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-intensity discharge must be titrated. If the shaking becomes too chaotic or fast, it can lead to 'catharsis' without integration. Slowing it down ensures the nervous system can process the energy."

        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "When working with 'Somatic Parts' (L6), a practitioner notices a client's shoulder hiking up toward their ear every time they talk about work. This is best addressed by:",
            "options": [
                "Telling the client to relax their shoulder",
                "Asking the 'shoulder' what it is trying to protect or communicate in that moment",
                "Massaging the shoulder to release the tension manually",
                "Ignoring it, as it is just a physical habit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Somatic Parts work, physical contractions are viewed as 'parts' with protective intentions. Inquiring into the 'part's' purpose allows for somatic integration and resolution of the underlying conflict."
