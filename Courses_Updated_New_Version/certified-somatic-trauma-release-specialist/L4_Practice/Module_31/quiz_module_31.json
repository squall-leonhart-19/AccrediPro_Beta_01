            "id": "q31_1",
            "question": "When defining a Somatic Niche (L1), why is it considered more effective to focus on a specific 'Biological State' rather than just a demographic?",
            "options": [
                "Demographics are no longer relevant in digital marketing algorithms.",
                "It allows the practitioner to speak directly to the client's internal 'felt sense' and physiological symptoms.",
                "Biological states are easier to target using Facebook and Google ad keywords.",
                "Focusing on demographics is considered unethical in trauma-informed care."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A somatic niche succeeds by identifying the physiological patterns (e.g., chronic freeze, high-functioning anxiety) that the client experiences, creating an immediate sense of being 'seen' at a nervous system level."

        {
            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Messaging (L2), why is traditional 'Pain-Point Agitation' marketing discouraged?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive to implement in small practices.",
                "It requires a high level of copywriting expertise that most somatic practitioners lack.",
                "It can inadvertently trigger a client's survival response, making the 'buying' environment feel unsafe.",
                "Pain-point marketing only works for physical products, not service-based coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Agitating trauma-related pain points can cause dysregulation or 're-traumatization' in the prospect, which contradicts the core somatic principle of establishing safety and stabilization first."

        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "Which design element is a hallmark of a 'Safety-First' Digital Presence (L3)?",
            "options": [
                "Using high-contrast, 'urgent' colors like bright red and neon yellow.",
                "Implementing 'auto-play' videos to capture attention immediately.",
                "Providing clear 'Exit' or 'Grounding' buttons and using soft, regulating color palettes.",
                "Hiding the pricing until the very end of the sales page to build mystery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A safety-first digital presence prioritizes the user's agency and nervous system regulation, using calming aesthetics and providing 'outs' if the content becomes overwhelming."

            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "According to the Somatic Content Strategy (L4), what is the primary objective of 'Top-of-Funnel' educational content?",
            "options": [
                "To close the sale immediately through a 'Limited Time Offer.'",
                "To normalize physiological symptoms and bridge the gap between 'the problem' and 'the nervous system.'",
                "To provide a full 60-minute somatic release session for free.",
                "To compare your services negatively against traditional talk therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Top-of-funnel content aims to educate the market on 'why' they feel the way they do (e.g., explaining the Freeze response), positioning the practitioner as an expert guide in somatic resolution."

            "id": "q31_5",

            "options": [
                "A traditional accountant or financial advisor.",
                "A trauma-informed therapist who does not offer body-based interventions.",
                "A high-volume discount gym owner.",
                "A pharmaceutical sales representative."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapists often reach a 'plateau' with clients using talk-based modalities and are looking for somatic specialists to help process the 'bottom-up' physiological components of trauma."

            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "During an Ethical Discovery Call (L6), what should a practitioner do if a prospect begins to 'flood' or hyper-ventilate while sharing their history?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the sales script to ensure the call stays on track for time.",
                "Tell the client that this is exactly why they need to buy the high-ticket package.",
                "Pause the intake process immediately and lead a brief co-regulation or grounding exercise.",
                "End the call and tell the client they are not ready for somatic work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An ethical somatic discovery call is a 'microcosm' of the work; prioritizing the client's regulation over the 'sale' builds immense trust and demonstrates clinical competency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This ratio ensures the practitioner provides massive value and builds a relationship (connection) before asking for a transaction (promotion), which is vital for trauma-sensitive audiences."

            "id": "q31_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In group somatic work, the practitioner must be skilled in 'container management' to ensure that one person's intense processing doesn't overwhelm the nervous systems of the other participants."

            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "A 2023 industry analysis suggested that 'Educational Marketing' in the somatic space results in a ____ higher client retention rate compared to 'Hype-Based' marketing.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Education-based marketing (n=1,200 practitioners surveyed) showed a 40% higher retention because clients enter the container with a 'cognitive buy-in' to the physiological process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical copy uses invitational language ('Explore'), focuses on the process ('body-based path'), and makes realistic, non-triggering claims ('resolving stored tension')."
