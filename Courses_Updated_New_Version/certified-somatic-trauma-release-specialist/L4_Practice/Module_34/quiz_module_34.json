            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Collective Nervous System refers to the emergent property where individual nervous systems influence and synchronize with one another within a group container."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When 'Architecting the Container' (L2), which agreement is most critical for preventing 'trauma dumping' and maintaining somatic focus?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Focusing on sensation over narrative prevents the group from becoming overwhelmed by traumatic details (trauma dumping) and keeps the work rooted in the somatic experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synchronized grounding aims to move the group into a state of safety (ventral vagal) so that deeper work can be performed without triggering global dysregulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shared themes are identified through 'Collective Locating,' where the facilitator tracks the resonance and patterns that emerge organically from the group's current state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The facilitator must hold the safety of the container while helping the group pendulate, ensuring the discharge remains within the collective 'Window of Tolerance.'"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding ensures that participants build the necessary 'somatic capacity' through simpler exercises before moving into high-intensity trauma release work."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Witnessing allows participants to see their own experiences reflected in others, which reduces shame and uses mirror neurons to help regulate the nervous system through community connection."
