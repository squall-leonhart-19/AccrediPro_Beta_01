            "question": "A client begins describing severe clinical depression and active suicidal ideation during a session. According to the L4 Scope of Practice, what is the practitioner's immediate legal and ethical obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Attempt to regulate the client's nervous system using advanced breathwork",
                "Diagnose the client with Major Depressive Disorder to facilitate a referral",
                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional or emergency services immediately",
                "Continue the somatic release work but increase the frequency of sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Trauma Release Specialists must operate within their scope, which excludes diagnosing mental illness or treating acute psychiatric crises. Immediate referral is mandatory for client safety and legal compliance."

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "In the context of somatic trauma work, how is 'Informed Consent' legally defined compared to traditional coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It is a one-time signature obtained during the initial intake process",
                "It is a dynamic, ongoing process that must be renegotiated, especially during 'state shifts' or when introducing touch",
                "It is only required if the practitioner plans to use physical touch",
                "It is a verbal agreement that does not require written documentation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because somatic work involves the nervous system and potentially physical touch, consent is considered 'dynamic.' It must be revisited as the client's physiological state changes to ensure autonomy is maintained."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "A practitioner is sued by a client who claims a specific somatic technique caused a physical injury. Which type of insurance is designed to cover this 'errors and omissions' claim?",

                "General Liability Insurance",
                "Professional Liability Insurance (Malpractice)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional Liability Insurance (also known as Malpractice or E&O) covers claims arising from the specific professional services and techniques provided by the specialist."

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on the Ethics of Touch, what is the 'Right of Refusal' requirement for somatic practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner must allow the client to refuse touch at any time without penalty or explanation",
                "The client must provide a written reason if they wish to stop a touch-based intervention",
                "The practitioner can override a refusal if they believe it is a 'trauma response' that needs to be worked through",
                "The right of refusal only applies to the first 15 minutes of a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Right of Refusal' is absolute. Clients must feel safe to withdraw consent at any moment, and practitioners must respect this immediately to avoid ethical violations or legal battery charges."

            "id": "q33_5",

            "options": [
                "In a locked filing cabinet or an encrypted, password-protected digital environment",
                "On a personal laptop as long as the laptop has a login password",
                "In a shared Google Doc for easy access by the client and practitioner",
                "Data storage is not regulated for somatic specialists, only for medical doctors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Both HIPAA and GDPR require high-level security for health-related data, including encryption for digital files and physical locks for paper records to prevent unauthorized access."

            "id": "q33_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mandatory reporting laws vary by state and country. Practitioners must know if their specific certification or local laws classify them as a 'mandated reporter' for child or elder abuse."

            "options": [
                "The jurisdiction where the practitioner is physically located",
                "The jurisdiction where the client is physically located at the time of the session",
                "Federal law only, regardless of state or provincial boundaries",
                "International maritime law for all internet-based services"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In most regions, professional services are considered to occur where the 'client' is located. Practitioners must ensure they are compliant with the laws of the client's state or country."

                "'I am a Certified Somatic Trauma Release Specialist through AccrediPro Academy.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Claiming to 'cure' a clinical diagnosis like PTSD is a violation of ethics and consumer protection laws. Practitioners must avoid making 'medical claims' and use language focused on support and regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "A practitioner is asked by a current client to enter into a joint business venture. Why is this considered a 'Dual Relationship' risk?",
            "options": [
                "It is only a risk if the business loses money",
                "It creates a conflict of interest and may lead to exploitation or impaired professional judgment",
                "It is actually encouraged as a way to build 'community' in somatic work",
                "It is only a risk if the practitioner is the minority shareholder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships (being both a practitioner and a business partner) blur boundaries, making it difficult to maintain the objectivity and safety required for trauma-informed work."

            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "Does a 'Hold Harmless' clause or Liability Waiver protect a practitioner from claims of 'Gross Negligence'?",
            "options": [
                "Yes, a signed waiver is a total defense against all legal claims",
                "No, courts generally hold that one cannot waive their right to sue for gross negligence or intentional harm",
                "Only if the waiver was signed in the presence of a notary public",
                "Only if the client is over the age of 21"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While waivers are essential for managing 'ordinary risk,' they do not protect practitioners from 'gross negligence' (extreme lack of care) or intentional misconduct. High standards of care must always be maintained."
