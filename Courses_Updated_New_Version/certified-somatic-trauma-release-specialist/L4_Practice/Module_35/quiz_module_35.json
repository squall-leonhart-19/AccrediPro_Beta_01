            "question": "In the transition from 'Practitioner' to 'Somatic CEO,' what is the primary shift required in how value is perceived?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from valuing 'hours worked' to valuing 'systematized transformation'",
                "Increasing the hourly rate for 1:1 sessions until demand drops",
                "Focusing exclusively on marketing rather than clinical outcomes",
                "Delegating all client interactions to junior staff immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The CEO mindset shift involves moving away from the 'time-for-money' trap and toward creating scalable systems that deliver transformation without the founder's constant presence in every interaction."

            "id": "q35_2",
            "question": "When scaling the R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Framework™ for group dynamics, what is the recommended 'Safety Ratio' for high-intensity somatic release work?",
            "options": [
                "1 lead facilitator for every 30 participants",
                "1 trained facilitator or assistant for every 8-10 participants",
                "1 lead facilitator for every 50 participants if using video",
                "No ratio is required if the lead facilitator is highly experienced"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain the 'Containment Field' and ensure individual safety during group somatic releases, a ratio of 1:8 or 1:10 is the industry standard for high-touch trauma work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, why is a 'Drip-Feed' content strategy preferred over 'All-Access' for digital somatic courses?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to finish recording the content later",
                "It increases the total duration of the subscription",
                "It prevents 'Somatic Overwhelm' and ensures the nervous system can integrate each module",
                "It is a requirement for most Learning Management Systems (LMS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic work requires neural integration; dumping 20 hours of trauma-release content at once can trigger a 'freeze' response or overwhelm the student's capacity to process the work."

            "id": "q35_4",
            "question": "What is the primary psychological purpose of the 'Integration Phase' (Post-Retreat) in a high-ticket somatic immersion?",
            "options": [
                "To upsell the client into a more expensive 1:1 program",
                "To collect testimonials while the client is still in a 'high' state",
                "To bridge the 'liminal space' of the retreat back to the client's daily environment to prevent relapse",
                "To ensure the client pays their final remaining balance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Without a structured integration phase, clients often experience 'Retreat Blues' or a 'Crash' when their newly regulated state meets their old, unregulated environment."

            "id": "q35_5",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional Medicine and Psychotherapy offer complementary 'Top-Down' and 'Bottom-Up' approaches, creating a holistic referral ecosystem that benefits the client's biology and psychology."

            "id": "q35_6",
            "question": "In the context of Somatic Supervision (Lesson 6), what does the term 'Parallel Process' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "When a practitioner and client both experience a release at the exact same time",
                "Running two group programs simultaneously to increase revenue",
                "When the dynamics between the practitioner and client are mirrored in the relationship between the supervisor and practitioner",
                "Using two different somatic modalities on the same client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel process is a clinical phenomenon where the practitioner unconsciously recreates the client's relational patterns within the supervision session, providing key insights into the case."

                "A Non-Compete clause lasting at least 10 years",
                "A 'Work-for-Hire' provision with an express assignment of IP rights",
                "A verbal agreement of mutual respect",
                "A clause that prevents the contractor from using any somatic techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Work-for-Hire' provision ensures that any materials or modifications created by a contractor for your business are legally owned by the business, not the individual creator."

        {
            "id": "q35_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Sustainable Mastery.' What is the 'Upper Limit Problem' in the context of scaling a somatic practice?",
            "options": [
                "The maximum amount of money a practitioner is legally allowed to earn",
                "The point where a practitioner's nervous system triggers self-sabotage because the level of success feels 'unsafe'",
                "Running out of physical space in a clinic or studio",
                "The maximum number of clients a human can physically see in a week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Upper Limit Problem' (Gay Hendricks) suggests that if our capacity for expansion exceeds our nervous system's 'Window of Tolerance' for success, we will unconsciously self-sabotage to return to a familiar level of 'safety'."

            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "When facilitating the R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Framework™ in a group, why is the 'R' (Recognize Arousal) stage more complex than in 1:1 work?",
            "options": [
                "Because participants are more likely to lie about their feelings in a group",
                "Due to 'Emotional Contagion,' where one participant's sympathetic arousal can trigger a chain reaction in the room",
                "Because the facilitator cannot see everyone at once",
                "Because group work is inherently less effective for arousal recognition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In group settings, the 'Somatic Field' is shared; the facilitator must manage the collective arousal to ensure one person's intense release doesn't retraumatize others who are not yet regulated."

            "id": "q35_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 3 suggests that digital somatic programs see a significantly higher completion rate (approx. 40% higher) when they include:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Community and social regulation (Co-regulation) are primary drivers of engagement in somatic work; isolation often leads to 'freeze' or abandonment of the practice."
