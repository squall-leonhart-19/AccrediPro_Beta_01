            "question": "Which of the following best defines the 'Scope of Practice' boundary for a Somatic Trauma Release Specialist compared to a Licensed Clinical Psychotherapist?",
            "options": [
                "Coaches focus on physiological regulation and present-moment integration, while therapists diagnose and treat DSM-5 mental disorders.",
                "Coaches can treat PTSD as long as they do not use manual touch or bodywork.",
                "There is no legal difference between the two as long as the practitioner is certified by a private board.",
                "Coaches focus on the past (childhood trauma) while therapists focus exclusively on future-oriented goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Somatic Specialist operates in the realm of nervous system education and regulation. Diagnosing or treating clinical mental health disorders (like MDD or PTSD) is the exclusive domain of licensed clinical professionals."

            "question": "Lesson 2 discusses the 'Generalist Paradox.' Why is being a 'generalist' often detrimental to a somatic practice's growth?",
            "options": [
                "It requires too many different types of equipment.",
                "It makes the specialist appear less authoritative and makes 'Bridge Language' marketing nearly impossible to target effectively.",
                "Generalists are legally required to have higher insurance premiums.",
                "A generalist cannot ethically use the title 'Specialist' under ASI standards."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Generalist Paradox suggests that by trying to help everyone with everything, your message becomes diluted, making it harder for specific clients to recognize you as the solution to their unique somatic needs."

            "question": "When 'Designing the Somatic Container' for virtual sessions (Lesson 3), what is the primary purpose of the 'Pre-Session Environment Audit'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client has the fastest possible internet connection for video clarity.",
                "To verify the client is in a private, safe space where they can express vocalizations or movement without fear of being overheard.",
                "To make sure the client's background looks professional for the recording.",
                "To confirm the client has purchased the specific props recommended by the specialist."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In somatic work, the 'container' must be physically and psychologically safe. If a client is worried about a roommate or spouse hearing them, they will remain in a state of high-tone sympathetic arousal, preventing deep release."

            "id": "q30_4",
            "question": "Marketing somatic work is often called 'Marketing the Invisible.' What does Lesson 4 suggest is the most effective way to communicate value to a traumatized lead?",
            "options": [
                "Using complex neurological terms like 'neuro-visceral integration' to show expertise.",
                "Showing graphic 'before and after' photos of clients having emotional releases.",
                "Using 'Bridge Language' that connects their current somatic symptoms (e.g., tight chest, insomnia) to their desired felt-state (e.g., easy breathing, deep rest).",
                "Offering a 100% guarantee that their trauma will be 'healed' in a specific number of sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bridge Language meets the client where they are, using their own internal experience and symptoms to explain the benefits of somatic work without relying on confusing jargon or making unethical 'cure' claims."

            "id": "q30_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Value-Based Pricing' is recommended over 'Hourly Billing.' What is a primary psychological benefit of package-based pricing for the client?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the client to pay less per hour than they would otherwise.",
                "It creates a 'financial container' that fosters commitment and reduces the 'flight' response when difficult somatic material arises.",
                "It ensures the specialist gets paid even if the client cancels at the last minute.",
                "It simplifies the specialist's bookkeeping and tax preparation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client commits to a package (a container), they are less likely to quit when the work gets 'messy' or uncomfortable, which is a common occurrence in trauma release work."

            "id": "q30_6",
            "question": "During a 'Trauma-Informed Discovery Call' (Lesson 6), if a potential client begins to hyperventilate while recounting their history, what is the specialist's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "To continue the intake to ensure all medical history is captured.",
                "To pivot immediately to the 'closing' part of the sales script to secure the client.",
                "To pause the 'sales' process and use a grounding resource to help the client stabilize.",
                "To end the call immediately and refer them to an emergency room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A trauma-informed specialist prioritizes the client's current state of regulation over the sales outcome. Stabilizing the lead demonstrates the specialist's competence and creates immediate trust."

            "id": "q30_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is a major ethical pitfall for somatic specialists building a social media presence?",
            "options": [
                "Using too many hashtags, which triggers the algorithm's 'spam' filter.",
                "Posting 'Trauma Porn' or overly evocative content that may dysregulate the audience's nervous systems without providing a resource for stabilization.",
                "Failing to post at least three times per day to maintain visibility.",
                "Sharing educational content that is too easy for the general public to understand."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialists must be mindful that their audience likely has sensitized nervous systems. Content that is too graphic or intense can cause vicarious trauma or dysregulation in the viewer, which is antithetical to somatic safety."

        {
            "id": "q30_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 defines 'Vicarious Trauma' (VT). How does VT differ from standard 'Burnout'?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is only physical, while VT is only psychological.",
                "VT involves a fundamental shift in the practitioner’s world-view and sense of safety due to repeated exposure to client trauma stories.",
                "Burnout is caused by clients, while VT is caused by the specialist's own past.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in the somatic field."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout is often about exhaustion and workload, Vicarious Trauma is a 'cost of caring' that changes how the practitioner perceives the world (e.g., feeling that the world is no longer safe)."

            "id": "q30_9",
            "question": "A practitioner is calculating their 'Sustainable Capacity.' If they want to avoid burnout and maintain high-quality presence, what is the recommended range of 'Direct Client Hours' per week for a full-time somatic specialist?",

                "5–8 hours per week."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the intense emotional and energetic demands of somatic trauma work, most experts recommend 15–22 direct client hours per week as the 'sweet spot' for professional longevity."

            "id": "q30_10",

            "options": [
                "To learn new marketing tactics from more successful practitioners.",
                "To provide a space for 'metabolizing' the energetic and emotional residue of client sessions and checking for countertransference.",
                "To split the cost of expensive office space or software.",
                "To ensure all practitioners are charging the same rates to avoid price wars."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervision is essential for somatic specialists to process the 'residue' of the work, ensure they aren't projecting their own trauma onto clients (countertransference), and maintain ethical boundaries."
