            "question": "What is the primary physiological objective of 'Titration' within the Evoke phase of somatic release?",
            "options": [
                "To encourage a full cathartic discharge as quickly as possible.",
                "To break down traumatic charge into 'bite-sized' pieces to prevent nervous system flooding.",
                "To keep the client focused exclusively on positive resources to avoid activation.",
                "To induce a state of deep hypnotic trance for memory retrieval."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the processing of trauma by working with very small amounts of sensory information at a time, ensuring the nervous system stays within the window of tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the context of Pendulation, what are the two 'poles' the practitioner helps the client navigate between?",
            "options": [
                "The past and the future.",
                "The sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems.",
                "A state of resource (safety/calm) and a state of activation (sensation/tension).",
                "Cognitive thoughts and emotional feelings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is the rhythmic shifting of attention between a 'resource' (a place of relative ease or safety) and the 'vortex' of traumatic activation or sensation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark of 'Clean Language' in somatic verbal inquiry, as discussed in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Asking 'Why do you think you feel that way?'",
                "Using metaphors provided by the practitioner to explain the client's experience.",
                "Asking 'And what kind of [client's word] is that [client's word]?'",
                "Directing the client to ignore physical sensations and focus on the narrative."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clean Language uses the client's exact words and avoids introducing the practitioner's biases or interpretations, which helps 'unlock' the somatic experience without leading the client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "How is 'The Somatic Edge' defined in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "The point where a client completely dissociates from the body.",
                "The boundary between the Window of Tolerance and the beginning of sympathetic flooding or dorsal collapse.",
                "The final stage of a session where the client feels total relief.",
                "A physical barrier in the fascia that requires deep tissue manipulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Edge is the threshold where the charge is high enough to facilitate change but low enough to maintain safety and awareness; it is the boundary of the Window of Tolerance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A client reports a 'tight knot' in their solar plexus. Using the '50/50 Rule' of Dual Awareness, how should the practitioner guide them?",
            "options": [
                "Guide them to put 100% of their focus into the knot to 'burn it out.'",
                "Ask them to ignore the knot and focus entirely on the sound of the practitioner's voice.",
                "Encourage them to feel the knot while simultaneously noticing the support of the chair beneath them.",
                "Suggest they visualize the knot dissolving into water."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dual Awareness (the 50/50 rule) involves maintaining a connection to the present-moment safety (the chair) while observing the internal activation (the knot)."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which physiological sign most likely indicates a shift toward Parasympathetic 'Rest and Digest' during the evocation process?",
            "options": [
                "Dilated pupils and rapid, shallow breathing.",
                "Spontaneous deep sighing, stomach gurgling, or softening of the jaw.",
                "Increased muscle tone and cold extremities.",
                "A sudden increase in heart rate and darting eye movements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep sighs, digestive sounds (borborygmus), and muscle softening are classic indicators of the parasympathetic nervous system coming back online."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses evoking the Sympathetic response. When is this appropriate in a Somatic Release session?",
            "options": [
                "Never; the goal is always to stay in the parasympathetic state.",
                "When a client is stuck in 'freeze' (dorsal vagal) and needs mobilized energy to move toward completion.",
                "Only when the client requests a high-intensity emotional release.",
                "At the very beginning of every session to 'wake up' the body."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients in a 'freeze' or 'shutdown' state, carefully evoking a small amount of sympathetic (mobilizing) energy is necessary to move them back through the arousal curve toward completion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, what is the primary indicator that the practitioner should transition from 'Evoke' to 'Alchemize'?",
            "options": [
                "The session time is running out.",
                "The client has stopped talking.",
                "The emergence of 'biological completion' signals like involuntary trembling or heat discharge.",
                "The client reports feeling 'bored' with the current sensation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The transition to Alchemize occurs when the evoked energy begins to move or discharge through the body's natural completion mechanisms, such as neurogenic tremors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 2 suggests that Titration reduces the risk of 'Kindling.' What is Kindling in a somatic context?",
            "options": [
                "The process of building a fire for a ritual.",
                "The sensitization of the nervous system where smaller triggers cause increasingly larger traumatic reactions.",
                "A method of using touch to warm up the muscles.",
                "The positive reinforcement of healthy habits."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kindling refers to the process where the nervous system becomes hyper-sensitized to stress; titration prevents this by ensuring the system is never overwhelmed during the release process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client begins to shake uncontrollably and expresses fear that they are 'losing it.' What is the most 'Somatic Edge' appropriate response?",
            "options": [
                "Tell them to stop shaking immediately to regain control.",
                "Encourage them to shake harder to get it all out.",
                "Validate the shaking as a natural release and use pendulation to ground them in a resource.",
                "Leave the room to give them private space for the release."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The practitioner should normalize the discharge (neurogenic tremors) while ensuring the client stays 'on the edge' rather than falling into 'the abyss' of fear by using pendulation/grounding."
