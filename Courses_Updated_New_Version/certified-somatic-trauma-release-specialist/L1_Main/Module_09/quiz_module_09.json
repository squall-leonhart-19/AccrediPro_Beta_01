            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "Which specific brain region is primarily responsible for 'Interoceptive Awareness,' allowing a client to sense the internal visceral 'gut feeling' of a boundary violation?",
            "options": [
                "The Insula",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Corpus Callosum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Insula acts as the primary hub for interoception, mapping the internal state of the body and providing the 'felt sense' of boundary comfort or intrusion."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Skin Armor'—a chronic, rigid tension in the superficial muscle layers. According to Lesson 2, this somatic marker most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "A state of total dorsal vagal collapse",
                "A hyper-vigilant, protective boundary response to prevent external intrusion",
                "A healthy, flexible social engagement system",
                "A lack of muscle tone due to sedentary lifestyle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Skin armor is a somatic defense mechanism where the body creates a literal 'shield' of tension to compensate for porous or previously ruptured psychological boundaries."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the 'No Reflex' training (Lesson 3), what is the primary purpose of the 'Somatic Push' exercise?",
            "options": [
                "To build upper body strength for physical combat",
                "To induce a state of therapeutic exhaustion",
                "To re-establish the neuro-motor pathway of agency and self-protection",
                "To test the practitioner's physical resistance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Push exercise uses physical resistance to help the client reclaim the 'No' reflex, re-coupling the intent to protect oneself with the motor action of doing so."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Somatic Compliance' (The Fawn Response) as discussed in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "A conscious decision to be polite to the practitioner",
                "A biological 'appeasement' strategy used to survive a perceived threat by abandoning one's own needs",
                "A sign of high-level spiritual enlightenment and ego-death",
                "A voluntary relaxation technique used in yoga"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic compliance or 'fawning' is a survival-based nervous system state where the individual prioritizes the needs of the 'aggressor' or 'authority' to maintain safety, often at the cost of their own boundaries."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "During the 'Settle & Shield' phase of post-conflict recovery, which physiological sign suggests the client is successfully discharging sympathetic arousal?",
            "options": [
                "Pupillary dilation and increased heart rate",
                "Breath holding and muscle bracing",
                "Spontaneous shivering, trembling, or a deep 'cleansing' sigh",
                "A sudden onset of sleepiness or 'checking out'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trembling and deep sighs are hallmark signs of the nervous system completing a stress cycle and returning to the ventral vagal state (the Window of Tolerance)."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "The Social Engagement System (Lesson 6) is primarily mediated by which branch of the nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) of the Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC)",
                "The Sympathetic Adrenal-Medullary (SAM) axis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) facilitates social bonding, facial expression, and vocal prosody, which are the foundations of the Social Engagement System."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "If a practitioner begins to feel an intense, localized pressure in their chest that mirrors the client's described history of 'heartbreak,' this is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Dissonance",
                "Somatic Countertransference",
                "A heart attack (always)",
                "Anterior Cingulate dysfunction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Countertransference occurs when the practitioner's body picks up on and mirrors the client's internal states or 'unspoken' trauma through somatic empathy."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Within the R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Protocol, why is 'Establishing Boundaries' (Phase 2) critical before the 'Release' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the session stays within the 60-minute timeframe",
                "To create a 'Containment Field' that prevents the client's nervous system from flooding or re-traumatization",
                "Because the law requires a signed boundary agreement",
                "To prove the practitioner is in charge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without established boundaries and a sense of containment, the 'Release' phase can lead to overwhelm (flooding) rather than therapeutic integration."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client named Marcus freezes and loses eye contact whenever he is asked to set a verbal boundary. Which 'Micro-Movement' intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Asking Marcus to shout 'NO' as loud as possible immediately",
                "Gently inviting Marcus to notice the sensation in his feet and press them into the floor",
                "Ending the session because he is 'uncooperative'",
                "Telling him a joke to lighten the mood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding through the feet provides the 'biological support' needed to move out of a freeze state before attempting more complex boundary work like verbalizing 'No'."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "Research on interpersonal trauma suggests that individuals with chronic boundary ruptures often have a 'muted' response in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). This results in:",
            "options": [
                "Improved mathematical abilities",
                "Difficulty distinguishing between their own emotions and the emotions of others",
                "An inability to see the color red",
                "Enhanced physical balance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ACC is involved in social evaluation and self-other differentiation; when muted by trauma, the 'boundary' between self and other becomes neurobiologically blurred."
