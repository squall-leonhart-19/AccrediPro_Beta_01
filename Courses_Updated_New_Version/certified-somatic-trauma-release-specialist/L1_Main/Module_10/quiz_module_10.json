            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which brain structure is primarily responsible for the storage of 'implicit' somatic memories that lack a narrative or time stamp?",
            "options": [
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The amygdala stores implicit, emotional, and procedural memories, often without the context of time or narrative, which is why somatic trauma can feel like it is happening in the 'now.' The hippocampus handles explicit, declarative memory."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'The Practitioner as the Anchor,' what is the primary mechanism by which a practitioner's regulated state influences the client?",
            "options": [
                "Verbal reassurance and cognitive reframing",
                "Mirror neurons and biological co-regulation",
                "Direct energetic transfer through touch",
                "Advanced hypnotic suggestion techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Through mirror neurons, the client's nervous system 'reads' the practitioner's regulated state, facilitating co-regulation and providing a safe container for the client to explore their own activation."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "During Somatic Mapping, chronic tension in the suboccipital muscles (base of the skull) is most frequently correlated with which survival state?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-vigilance and the 'scanning' response",
                "Deep dorsal vagal collapse",
                "The 'Fawn' response and people-pleasing",
                "Lower body bracing for flight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The suboccipital muscles are closely linked to the visual system and the 'orienting' response; chronic tension here often indicates a state of persistent hyper-vigilance or 'scanning' for threats."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In the 'Evoke' methodology of titration, what does the practitioner do to ensure the client does not bypass their window of tolerance?",
            "options": [
                "Encourages the client to 'push through' the discomfort",
                "Focuses exclusively on the most traumatic part of the memory",
                "Slows the process down to work with the smallest 'beads' of sensation",
                "Uses rapid eye movements to distract the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration (the 'Evoke' phase) involves breaking down the traumatic material into manageable 'beads' or increments, ensuring the nervous system can process the energy without becoming overwhelmed."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a physiological sign of 'Discharge' (Lesson 5) rather than 'Settle' (Lesson 6)?",
            "options": [
                "A deep, spontaneous sigh",
                "Softening of the muscle tissue",
                "Involuntary neurogenic tremors or shaking",
                "Lowering of the heart rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Discharge involves the release of bound survival energy, often manifesting as tremors, heat, or crying. Settling is the subsequent recalibration into a parasympathetic state, characterized by sighs and softening."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Art of Settle,' what is the significance of a client experiencing 'peristalsis' (stomach gurgling) during a session?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates the client is hungry and the session should end",
                "It is a sign of sympathetic nervous system activation",
                "It indicates a shift into the ventral vagal/parasympathetic state",
                "It is a sign of an adverse reaction to the somatic work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Peristalsis is a clear indicator that the body is shifting out of a 'fight-or-flight' (sympathetic) state and into 'rest-and-digest' (parasympathetic), signaling a successful settle."

            "id": "q10_7",

            "options": [
                "Re-triggering the trauma to ensure it is gone",
                "Meaning-making and bridging the somatic shift to daily life",
                "Performing deep tissue manipulation on the psoas",
                "Remaining in a state of deep meditation for 30 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Emerge phase (Integration) helps the client consolidate the somatic release into their cognitive narrative, allowing them to carry the new state of regulation into their environment and relationships."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A practitioner notices they are feeling irritable, exhausted, and 'taking home' the clients' trauma. According to Lesson 8, this is a hallmark of:",
            "options": [
                "Counter-transference",
                "Vicarious traumatization",
                "Professional detachment",
                "Advanced empathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious traumatization (or compassion fatigue) occurs when the practitioner's own nervous system becomes dysregulated by the cumulative impact of witnessing others' trauma."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Titration' and 'Pendulation'?",
            "options": [
                "Titration is about intensity; Pendulation is about moving between resources and activation",
                "Titration is top-down; Pendulation is bottom-up",
                "There is no difference; they are synonymous",
                "Titration is used for shock trauma; Pendulation is used for developmental trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Titration refers to the 'slowing down' and breaking apart of the traumatic energy. Pendulation is the rhythmic movement between a state of activation (the trauma) and a state of resource (safety/comfort)."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "If a client begins to 'loop' in a traumatic narrative during a session, which somatic intervention is most appropriate for 'The Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client to provide more details about the event",
                "Interrupting the narrative and redirecting focus to a neutral body sensation",
                "Letting the client finish the story to ensure they feel heard",
                "Closing the session immediately to prevent further looping"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client 'loops' in narrative, they are often bypassing the body. The practitioner (The Anchor) should gently interrupt the cognitive loop and bring the client back to the present moment through somatic sensing."
