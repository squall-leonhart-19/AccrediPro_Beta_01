            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which specific brain region is considered the 'primary interoceptive cortex,' responsible for mapping the internal physiological state of the body?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Insular Cortex (Insula)",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex is the primary hub for interoception, processing signals from the viscera and internal organs to create a sense of the body's internal state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the shift from 'Narrative to Sensation' is described as moving from 'Top-Down' processing to 'Bottom-Up' processing. What does this mean in a clinical context?",
            "options": [
                "Prioritizing the client's cognitive story over their physical reactions",
                "Focusing on the client's childhood memories to explain current pain",
                "Prioritizing direct sensory experience over the mental interpretation of events",
                "Using logic and reasoning to talk the body out of a stress response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing starts with the sensory input (sensation) and moves toward the brain's interpretation, rather than starting with thoughts (top-down) to control the body."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to Eugene Gendlin's research on the 'Felt Sense,' how is a felt sense typically characterized when it first emerges?",
            "options": [
                "As a clear, distinct, and easily labeled emotion like 'anger'",
                "As a sharp, localized physical pain with a known medical cause",
                "As a murky, indistinct, and 'more than words' bodily sensation",
                "As a visual hallucination or flashback of a specific event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gendlin described the felt sense as initially murky and vague—a holistic 'body sense' of a situation that is more complex than a simple emotion."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A client describes a sensation as 'annoying' or 'bad.' According to Lesson 5 on Somatic Vocabulary, why is the practitioner encouraged to help the client find 'descriptive' rather than 'evaluative' words?",
            "options": [
                "Evaluative words trigger the 'judging' mind, whereas descriptive words (e.g., 'tight', 'warm') facilitate neutral observation",
                "Descriptive words are more scientific and easier to document in medical records",
                "Evaluative words are always inaccurate representations of trauma",
                "Descriptive words prevent the client from feeling any emotion during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Descriptive language (tingling, heavy, pulsing) allows for 'dual awareness' and neutral observation, while evaluative language (bad, scary) tends to keep the client stuck in a reactive emotional loop."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Research discussed in Lesson 2 suggests that trauma survivors often exhibit a specific interoceptive profile. Which of the following best describes it?",
            "options": [
                "Low interoceptive sensibility and high interoceptive accuracy",
                "High interoceptive sensibility (feeling 'too much') but low interoceptive accuracy (misinterpreting signals)",
                "Complete absence of interoceptive signals",
                "Perfect alignment between physical signals and cognitive interpretation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma survivors often have high sensibility (intense awareness of internal signals) but low accuracy (difficulty accurately identifying or localizing what those signals mean)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client in a session reports feeling 'fuzzy,' 'numb,' and as if they are 'looking at the room from a distance.' Which state of the autonomic nervous system are they likely entering?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Hyper-arousal (Fight/Flight)",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "Dorsal Vagal Hypo-arousal (Dissociation)",
                "The Flow State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Numbness, fuzziness, and a sense of distance are hallmark signs of dissociation and the dorsal vagal 'shutdown' response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which technique involves shifting the client's attention between a 'somatic resource' (an area of ease) and a 'somatic challenge' (an area of tension) to build the internal container?",
            "options": [
                "Titration",
                "Pendulation",
                "Spatial Mapping",
                "Narrative Reframing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is the process of swinging attention between a place of safety/resource and a place of activation to prevent overwhelm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, Proprioception is defined as the 'sixth sense.' How does trauma specifically impact a client's proprioceptive map?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the client to become hyper-aware of their exact location in space",
                "It can lead to 'body schema' distortions, where a person feels smaller, larger, or 'clumsy' in their environment",
                "It eliminates the ability to feel gravity",
                "It has no impact on proprioception, only on emotions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma can disrupt the body schema, leading to a distorted sense of the body's boundaries, size, and relationship to the physical environment."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "When working with a client who is 'numb' (Lesson 6), what is the most effective somatic intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Force the client to describe the numbness until they cry",
                "Use high-intensity stimuli to 'break through' the numbness",
                "Titrate the awareness, treating the numbness itself as a physical sensation to be observed with curiosity",
                "Tell the client the session cannot continue until they feel something"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Numbness is a sensation in itself. By treating it with curiosity and 'titrating' awareness (focusing on small edges of it), the practitioner helps the client safely reconnect without re-traumatization."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Embody' phase within the RELEASE Framework™?",
            "options": [
                "To achieve an immediate emotional catharsis",
                "To establish a baseline of somatic awareness and create the 'internal container' necessary for safe release",
                "To explain the neuroscience of trauma to the client using diagrams",
                "To perform deep tissue manipulation to release muscle knots"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' (Embody) phase is about preparation and stabilization; it builds the capacity (the container) to sense the body so that the subsequent 'Release' phase is safe and effective."
