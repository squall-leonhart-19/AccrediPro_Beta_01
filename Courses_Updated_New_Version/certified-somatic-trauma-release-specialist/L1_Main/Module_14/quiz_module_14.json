            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of somatic storage (L1), where is traumatic 'memory' primarily held when it cannot be processed into a narrative form?",
            "options": [
                "The prefrontal cortex as a logical sequence",
                "The hippocampus as a time-stamped event",

                "Broca's area as a linguistic representation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Traumatic memories are often stored as implicit, non-declarative procedural memories in the body's tissues and nervous system, rather than explicit narrative memories in the hippocampus or cortex."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Framework™, what is the primary objective of the first 'E' (Cultivating Somatic Presence & Interoception)?",
            "options": [
                "To force an immediate emotional catharsis",
                "To develop the client's ability to track internal sensations without being overwhelmed",
                "To analyze the childhood origins of the trauma",
                "To perform deep tissue manipulation on holding patterns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first 'E' focuses on interoception, which is the capacity to sense and track internal physiological states, providing the necessary foundation for safe processing."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "During the 'R' phase (Foundations of Autonomic Regulation), which state must be established before moving toward discharge?",
            "options": [
                "A state of high sympathetic arousal",
                "A state of functional freeze or dissociation",
                "Sufficient 'biological capacity' within the Window of Tolerance",
                "Complete absence of all somatic sensations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regulation (R) ensures the client has the biological capacity and stability within their Window of Tolerance to handle the energy that will be released later in the process."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "When mapping somatic holding patterns (L5), what does a 'bracing' pattern typically signify?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of muscle tone due to exhaustion",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bracing is a somatic holding pattern where the body chronically contracts muscles to create 'armoring' against physical or emotional impact."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Successful discharge of survival energy is typically marked by involuntary movements (tremors), temperature changes (heat), or respiratory shifts (sighing/yawning)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Settling allows the nervous system to integrate the changes and find a more regulated, higher-functioning baseline after the activation has subsided."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client practicing pendulation (L6) is focused on a 'tightness' in their throat. If they begin to feel overwhelmed, where should the practitioner guide their attention?",
            "options": [
                "Deeper into the tightness to 'break it open'",
                "To a 'resource' or neutral area of the body, such as the feet or a calm breath",
                "To the most painful memory they have",
                "To the practitioner's own face for co-regulation only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation involves moving between the 'trauma vortex' (tightness) and a 'resource vortex' (neutral or pleasant sensation) to build resiliency and prevent overwhelm."

            "options": [
                "It makes people more prone to anxiety attacks",
                "It has no measurable effect on emotional health",
                "It is correlated with better emotional regulation and greater resilience",
                "It decreases the ability to feel empathy for others"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High interoceptive accuracy allows individuals to detect physiological shifts early, enabling more effective emotional regulation and resilience."
