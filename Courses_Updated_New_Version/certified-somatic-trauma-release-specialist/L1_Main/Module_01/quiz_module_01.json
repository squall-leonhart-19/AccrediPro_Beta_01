            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is the 'freeze' or 'shut down' state characterized by Dorsal Vagal activation, leading to numbness, dissociation, and reduced physiological activity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system by slowing the heart rate (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia), signaling the brain to move toward a state of regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation relies on the practitioner's ability to maintain a regulated state, which the client's nervous system 'tunes' into via mirror neurons and neuroception of safety."

            "id": "q1_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orienting involves using the senses (sight, sound, smell) to connect with the external environment, confirming to the nervous system that the person is safe in the present moment."

                "To break down overwhelming sensations into small, manageable 'drops' of experience",
                "To measure the exact acidity level of the client's saliva"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is a core somatic principle that involves slowing down the processing of trauma into small increments to prevent the nervous system from becoming overwhelmed or re-traumatized."
