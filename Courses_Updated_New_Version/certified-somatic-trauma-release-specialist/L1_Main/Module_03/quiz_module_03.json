            "question": "The 'Architecture of Somatic Holding' (Lesson 1) emphasizes that trauma is not just a psychological state but is physically stored in which biological network?",
            "options": [
                "The endocrine system",
                "The fascial and connective tissue system",
                "The lymphatic drainage system",
                "The digestive tract exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 explains that the fascial system acts as a biological record-keeper, where chronic tension patterns create 'armoring' that stores the physical memory of traumatic events."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which neurobiological anchor is responsible for 'procedural memory,' explaining why a client's body reacts to a trigger before the conscious mind can process it?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum",
                "The Corpus Callosum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Procedural memory (the 'how-to' of survival) is stored in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, allowing the body to execute 'fight-flight' movements without conscious thought."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'completely disconnected from their legs' while discussing a stressful event. According to the Three Domains of Somatic Location, this is a failure of:",
            "options": [
                "Exteroception",
                "Interoception",
                "Proprioception",
                "Vestibular processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Feeling disconnected or 'numb' internally indicates a disruption in interoceptive processing."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Why is the Psoas muscle considered the primary 'Somatic Anchor' for the fight-or-flight response?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only muscle connected to the heart",
                "It is directly linked to the reptilian brain via the medial arcuate ligament of the diaphragm",
                "It controls the production of cortisol in the kidneys",
                "It is the largest muscle in the human body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The psoas is anatomically linked to the diaphragm and the reptilian brain, making it the first muscle to contract during a startle or threat response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "In the 'Somatic Vocabulary' (Lesson 5), which of the following words is a 'pure sensation' rather than an 'interpreted emotion'?",
            "options": [
                "Anxious",
                "Vulnerable",
                "Tight",
                "Betrayed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic release requires 'pure sensation' words like 'tight,' 'warm,' or 'heavy' rather than interpreted emotions like 'anxious,' which are cognitive labels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "While tracking a client, you notice their skin becomes flushed and their pupils dilate. According to Lesson 6, these micro-movements indicate:",
            "options": [
                "Parasympathetic activation (Rest and Digest)",
                "Sympathetic nervous system arousal",
                "A state of deep clinical hypnosis",
                "The client is falling asleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pupillary dilation and skin flushing (vasodilation/constriction) are autonomic signals of sympathetic nervous system activation, indicating the body is 'locating' a stressor."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, an 'Energetic Void' or area of numbness in the body is usually a somatic representation of:",
            "options": [
                "A lack of physical exercise in that specific limb",
                "Functional dissociation or a 'freeze' response to overwhelm",
                "A permanent loss of nerve function",
                "The client's lack of interest in the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Numbness is an active biological process of 'tuning out' a body part that was too painful or overwhelming to feel during the original trauma."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of creating a 'Somatic Blueprint' (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the client with a specific mental health disorder",
                "To create a visual map of the client's holding patterns, resources, and 'no-go' zones",
                "To provide a list of exercises for the client to do at the gym",
                "To document the client's family medical history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Blueprint is a synthesis tool used to map where a client stores tension, where they feel safe (resources), and which areas are currently dissociated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Chronic 'chest breathing' and a frozen diaphragm are often linked to the inhibition of which nerve, which is essential for the 'Social Engagement System'?",
            "options": [
                "The Sciatic Nerve",
                "The Vagus Nerve",
                "The Trigeminal Nerve",
                "The Ulnar Nerve"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The diaphragm and the Vagus nerve are intimately connected; a restricted diaphragm can 'lock' the Vagus nerve, preventing the body from moving into a state of safety and social engagement."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A client's hand begins to twitch in a 'pushing' motion while they recount a boundary violation. As a Specialist, you recognize this micro-movement as:",
            "options": [
                "A sign of neurological pathology that requires a doctor",
                "A random muscle spasm due to caffeine intake",
                "A 'thwarted' or incomplete survival impulse seeking completion",
                "A sign that the client is lying"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 teaches that micro-movements are often the body's attempt to complete a survival action (like pushing away an attacker) that was suppressed at the time of the trauma."
