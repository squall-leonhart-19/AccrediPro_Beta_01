            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "In the R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Framework™, what is the primary physiological objective of Step 1: Regulate?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client into a state of deep meditation",
                "To establish the 'Vagal Brake' and ensure the client is in a Ventral Vagal state of safety",
                "To immediately begin the discharge of sympathetic energy",
                "To map the specific locations of somatic armor in the body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Step 1 (Regulate) focuses on establishing physiological safety by engaging the Ventral Vagal Complex, often referred to as the 'Vagal Brake,' which allows the nervous system to remain present without being overwhelmed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the neuro-somatic foundations discussed in L1, what occurs when the 'Vagal Brake' is inhibited or released?",
            "options": [
                "The heart rate immediately slows down via the Dorsal Vagal pathway",
                "The client enters a state of 'Social Engagement'",
                "The heart rate increases rapidly as the sympathetic nervous system takes over",
                "The client experiences a 'Freeze' response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagal Brake (Ventral Vagal influence) keeps the heart rate slow. When it is inhibited, the heart rate increases, facilitating a sympathetic mobilization (fight/flight) response."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In Step 2: Embody, which brain region is most associated with 'Interoceptive Awareness'—the ability to sense the internal state of the body?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Insular Cortex (Insula)",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Basal Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex is the primary brain region responsible for processing interoceptive signals, allowing individuals to feel their 'felt sense' and internal physiological states."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Step 3: Locate involves mapping 'Somatic Armor.' According to the Reichian segments mentioned in the lesson, which segment is often associated with the suppression of crying and social 'masking'?",
            "options": [
                "The Pelvic Segment",
                "The Diaphragmatic Segment",
                "The Ocular and Oral Segments",
                "The Thoracic Segment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ocular and Oral segments (the face and jaw) are primary sites for somatic armor related to social masking, holding back tears, and suppressing vocal expressions of grief or anger."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "What is the critical difference between Titration and Pendulation in Step 4: Evoke?",
            "options": [
                "Titration is the movement between safety and activation, while Pendulation is the slowing down of the process",
                "Titration is breaking the trauma into 'micro-doses,' while Pendulation is the rhythmic shift between a resource and the activation",
                "Titration is only used for physical pain, while Pendulation is only used for emotional pain",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable in the R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Framework™"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration refers to processing trauma in the smallest manageable pieces (micro-doses). Pendulation is the technique of moving the client's attention between a 'resource' (place of safety) and the 'activation' (traumatic charge)."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "During Step 5: Alchemize, a client begins to experience involuntary trembling and a sudden increase in body temperature. What does this typically signify?",
            "options": [
                "The client is having a panic attack and the session should be stopped immediately",
                "The client is entering a 'Freeze' response and needs more regulation",
                "The successful discharge of stored sympathetic survival energy",
                "The client is experiencing a 'Dorsal Vagal' collapse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-genic tremors (shaking), heat, and yawning are classic biological signs of 'Alchemizing' or discharging the survival energy that was previously 'trapped' in the nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In Step 6: Settle, why is 'Neuro-Recalibration' essential after a discharge has occurred?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client can immediately return to work",
                "To allow the nervous system to integrate the shift and prevent the 're-pooling' of survival energy",
                "To force the client to remember the traumatic event more clearly",
                "To increase the client's heart rate back to sympathetic levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Settle phase is crucial for integration; it allows the nervous system to recalibrate to a new, lower baseline of arousal and prevents the system from immediately seeking a new source of stress."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Step 7: Emerge focuses on Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG). According to research cited in L8, what is a key indicator of PTG?",
            "options": [
                "The complete absence of any future stress or triggers",
                "The ability to forget the traumatic event entirely",
                "A shift from an 'External' to an 'Internal' Locus of Control and increased personal agency",
                "A decrease in interoceptive awareness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-Traumatic Growth is characterized by an increased sense of agency, an internal locus of control, and the ability to derive new meaning and purpose from one's experiences."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client in Step 4 (Locate) suddenly becomes 'checked out,' glassy-eyed, and unable to feel their feet. What is the most appropriate somatic intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Push further into the somatic mapping to break through the resistance",
                "Pause and return to Step 1: Regulate to re-establish the Vagal Brake and ground the client",
                "Immediately move to Step 5: Alchemize to force a discharge",
                "Ask the client to describe the trauma in high detail to bring them back to the present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation (checking out) indicates that the client has moved out of their 'Window of Tolerance.' The practitioner must pause and return to Step 1 (Regulate) to re-establish safety and grounding."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Statistics in L1 suggest that approximately what percentage of individuals will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, necessitating frameworks like R.E.L.E.A.S.E.?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "30-40%",
                "Around 70% or higher",
                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Epidemiological data (such as the CDC-ACE study and WHO surveys) suggests that approximately 70% of the global population will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime."
