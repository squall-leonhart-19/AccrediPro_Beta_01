            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "A dynamic, ongoing process that is renegotiated as the session evolves.",
                "Only necessary if the touch involves the head, hands, or feet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical somatic work requires 'dynamic consent,' meaning the practitioner checks in frequently and respects that a client may withdraw or change their consent for touch at any moment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Ignore the message entirely and block the client.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
