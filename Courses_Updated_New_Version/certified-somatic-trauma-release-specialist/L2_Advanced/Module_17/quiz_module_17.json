            "question": "When working with a client exhibiting 'Structural Fragmentation' (L1), what is the primary indicator that the practitioner should shift from direct release to containment?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to yawn and report sleepiness.",
                "The client experiences sudden, rapid shifts in personality or voice tone (switching).",
                "The client reports a mild tingling sensation in their hands.",
                "The client expresses a desire to talk about their childhood memories."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid shifts in personality or tone indicate structural dissociation/fragmentation. In these cases, 'parts' are present, and direct release can be destabilizing; focus must shift to containment and establishing an 'observing self' to maintain safety."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Chronic Pain, what is 'Central Sensitization' in the context of somatic trauma release?",
            "options": [
                "A localized injury that has not yet healed at the tissue level.",
                "A psychological refusal to acknowledge physical health.",
                "A state where the nervous system stays in high reactivity, magnifying pain signals even after tissue healing.",
                "The process of the brain shutting down pain signals through dissociation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Central Sensitization occurs when the nervous system remains in a state of 'high alert,' amplifying sensory input into pain signals long after the original injury has healed, often linked to unresolved survival energy."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, 'Advanced Titration' is defined as the process of:",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to release as much energy as possible in one session.",
                "Breaking down high-intensity survival energy into small, manageable 'drops' to avoid flooding.",
                "Using cognitive behavioral techniques to ignore physical sensations.",
                "Inducing a cathartic emotional outburst to clear the nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the 'slowing down' of the release process. By breaking high-intensity energy into small drops, the practitioner ensures the client's window of tolerance is not overwhelmed, preventing re-traumatization."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Why is 'Pre-Verbal Somatic Imprinting' (L4) particularly challenging for traditional talk therapy?",
            "options": [
                "The trauma is stored in the prefrontal cortex where language is processed.",
                "The client is usually choosing to withhold information about their infancy.",
                "The trauma occurred before the development of the hippocampus and language, storing it as implicit, felt-sense memory.",
                "Pre-verbal trauma is generally not significant enough to impact adult life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pre-verbal trauma is stored as implicit memory in the brainstem and limbic system. Because it occurred before the hippocampus (narrative memory) and Broca's area (language) were fully functional, it cannot be 'talked through' and must be accessed somatically."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Which somatic marker is most indicative of a 'Fawn Response' (L5) during a session?",
            "options": [
                "Clenched fists and an aggressive forward lean.",
                "Complete physical immobility and a drop in heart rate (Dorsal Vagal).",
                "Excessive nodding, over-compliance, and hyper-vigilance to the practitioner's facial expressions.",
                "A complete lack of eye contact and a flat affect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response is a survival strategy based on appeasement. Somatically, this manifests as being 'too good' of a client, over-complying, and constantly scanning the practitioner for cues of approval or safety."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Systemic and Generational Trauma.' What does the concept of 'Epigenetic Transmission' suggest about somatic symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Trauma symptoms are strictly learned through observation of parents.",
                "Environmental stress can alter gene expression that is passed down, manifesting as hyper-arousal in descendants.",
                "Generational trauma can only be healed if the client knows the specific history of their ancestors.",
                "Systemic trauma is purely social and has no impact on the individual's physiology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics shows that trauma-induced changes in gene expression (not the DNA sequence itself) can be passed to offspring, meaning a client may carry a 'survival-oriented' nervous system without having experienced the original trauma themselves."

        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "When working with Neurodivergent clients (L7), why might traditional 'interoceptive' cues (e.g., 'What do you feel in your stomach?') be counterproductive?",
            "options": [
                "Neurodivergent clients are usually uninterested in their bodies.",
                "Many neurodivergent individuals experience interoceptive hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity, making these cues overwhelming or confusing.",
                "The practitioner should only use cognitive-based interventions for ADHD and Autism.",
                "Neurodivergent clients do not experience the 'fight or flight' response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many Autistic or ADHD individuals have differences in interoception (sensing internal states). Asking for direct internal sensations can cause anxiety or 'blanking.' Practitioners should use external anchors (exteroception) or specific, concrete descriptors."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Integration and Relapse Prevention' (L8), what is the purpose of 'Somatic Resource Anchoring'?",
            "options": [
                "To remind the client of how much pain they used to be in.",
                "To create a specific physical 'anchor' or movement that triggers a state of safety and regulation in the real world.",
                "To ensure the client remains dependent on the practitioner for regulation.",
                "To force the nervous system to stay in a sympathetic state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resource anchoring involves identifying a movement, touch, or sensation that the client can use outside of the session to return to their Window of Tolerance when they feel triggered, promoting long-term integration."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client with chronic migraines (L2) reports that whenever they try to relax, the pain intensifies. This is likely due to:",
            "options": [
                "The client's imagination.",
                "A lack of commitment to the process.",
                "The 'Unmasking' of survival energy that was previously suppressed by the symptom.",
                "The practitioner using the wrong type of essential oil."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Often, chronic pain acts as a 'lid' on high-intensity survival energy. When the client begins to relax or release, the underlying charge (fight/flight) surfaces, which can temporarily increase the symptom intensity before it resolves."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "Which 'Complex Scenario' requires the practitioner to prioritize 'Pendulation' above all else?",
            "options": [
                "A client who is bored and wants to end the session early.",
                "A client dealing with high-intensity survival energy (L3) who is on the verge of a 'global high-intensity discharge.'",
                "A client who is talking too much about their daily schedule.",
                "A client who has already achieved full integration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-intensity scenarios, Pendulation (swinging between a resource/safety and the traumatic charge) is vital to ensure the nervous system can digest the energy without becoming overwhelmed or entering a freeze state."
