            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the R.E.L.E.A.S.E. Framework™, what is the primary clinical objective of the 'Regulate' phase before moving into deeper somatic work?",
            "options": [
                "To establish a physiological foundation of safety and stabilize the autonomic nervous system.",
                "To identify the specific childhood memory associated with the trauma.",
                "To encourage the client to discharge survival energy through vigorous movement.",
                "To map the client's internal 'felt sense' using interoceptive tracking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Regulate' phase (R) focuses on establishing safety and stabilizing the ANS, which is a prerequisite for any trauma processing to prevent re-traumatization."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which state of the nervous system must be active for a client to successfully 'Embody' (the second 'E' in the framework) and process interoceptive data?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Adrenal Medullary (SAM) activation",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",

                "Freeze Response (High-Arousal Immobility)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Embodiment requires a 'safe' state. The Ventral Vagal Complex allows for the social engagement and physiological calm necessary to turn attention inward without triggering a threat response."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During the 'Locate' phase, a practitioner notices a client has 'frozen' shoulders and a constricted throat. These are examples of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Locate' phase (L) involves identifying specific areas where trauma is somatically stored or 'held' in the body's tissues and musculature."

                "Exposing the client to the full intensity of the trauma to 'break through' the blockage.",
                "Breaking down traumatic charge into small, manageable pieces to stay within the window of tolerance.",
                "Using pharmacological interventions to lower the client's heart rate.",
                "Ignoring the trauma and focusing only on positive resources."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the processing of trauma into 'tiny drops' so the nervous system isn't overwhelmed."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "In the 'Alchemize' phase, a client begins to shake involuntarily and experience a change in body temperature. This is scientifically interpreted as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alchemize (A) facilitates the discharge of trapped energy. Shaking (neurogenic tremors) is a biological mechanism for completing the 'fight-or-flight' cycle."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",

            "options": [
                "To move immediately into the next traumatic memory.",
                "To allow the nervous system to recalibrate and return to homeostasis after a discharge.",
                "To analyze the session's meaning through cognitive behavioral therapy.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Settle (S) is crucial for integration; it allows the ANS to 'digest' the release and find a new, higher baseline of calm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Complex cases require extreme care with pacing (titration) and containment to ensure the client doesn't move into a state of 'flooding' or total shutdown."

            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis of somatic interventions (referenced in Module 19) showed that somatic tracking increased interoceptive accuracy by what average percentage in chronic pain patients?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates moderate but significant increases in interoceptive accuracy (approx. 22-30%) through consistent somatic tracking and embodiment practices."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Legal safety requires a clear 'Scope of Practice' statement, distinguishing somatic coaching/release from licensed psychotherapy or medical practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The amygdala is responsible for threat detection. In trauma, it becomes hyper-sensitized, triggering the 'Regulate' phase's necessity."

                "Only when the client is in a state of active crisis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
