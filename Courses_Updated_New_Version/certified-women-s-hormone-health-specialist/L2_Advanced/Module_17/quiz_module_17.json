            "question": "In the 'Multi-Glandular Puzzle' (L1), why is addressing subclinical hypothyroidism often prioritized over direct PCOS interventions for a client presenting with both?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid hormone is required for the synthesis of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), and low levels exacerbate hyperandrogenism.",
                "Hypothyroidism is the primary cause of insulin resistance in 95% of PCOS cases.",
                "Thyroid medication directly lowers Luteinizing Hormone (LH) pulses.",
                "Metformin is contraindicated in patients with elevated TSH levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormones stimulate the hepatic production of SHBG. In hypothyroidism, SHBG levels drop, leading to higher levels of free testosterone, which worsens PCOS symptoms like hirsutism and acne."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Which diagnostic criteria specifically distinguish Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) from the natural transition of perimenopause in a woman under age 40 (L2)?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated FSH (>40 mIU/mL) recorded on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart.",
                "A single high reading of Estradiol (>200 pg/mL).",
                "The presence of night sweats and irregular cycles for at least 3 months.",
                "Low Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) regardless of FSH levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "POI is defined by the loss of ovarian function before age 40, characterized by amenorrhea and the specific diagnostic marker of FSH levels in the menopausal range (typically >40 mIU/mL) on two separate tests."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the 'vicious cycle' of Histamine Intolerance and Endometriosis is explained. What is the biochemical relationship between estrogen and mast cells?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen inhibits mast cell degranulation, reducing histamine levels.",
                "Estrogen stimulates mast cells to release histamine, and histamine in turn stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen.",
                "Histamine degrades estrogen in the gut through the DAO enzyme.",
                "Progesterone and estrogen both trigger histamine release equally."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen can trigger mast cells to release histamine. Histamine then stimulates the H1 receptors in the ovaries to produce more estrogen, creating a self-perpetuating cycle that worsens estrogen-dominant conditions like endometriosis."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client with Post-Hormonal Contraceptive Syndrome (PHCS) and secondary amenorrhea (L4) shows low LH and FSH. What is the most likely physiological cause?",
            "options": [
                "Permanent ovarian failure caused by synthetic progestins.",
                "A 'communication gap' or suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis signaling after long-term suppression.",
                "Excessive production of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) binding all available hormones.",
                "Acute toxicity from residual synthetic hormones in adipose tissue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PHCS with secondary amenorrhea is often a result of the HPO axis remaining in a suppressed state after the cessation of exogenous hormones, requiring nutritional and lifestyle support to 're-awaken' the signaling."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, how does Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) contribute to the severity of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)?",
            "options": [
                "SIBO bacteria consume all available Vitamin B6, preventing serotonin synthesis.",
                "SIBO causes a direct drop in progesterone during the follicular phase.",
                "SIBO can lead to increased beta-glucuronidase activity, deconjugating estrogen and causing its recirculation, which alters the estrogen-to-progesterone ratio.",
                "SIBO prevents the absorption of dietary cholesterol, the precursor to all steroid hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dysbiosis (like SIBO) can increase the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which 'unclips' estrogen that was destined for excretion, allowing it to be reabsorbed. This excess estrogen can worsen the neuro-sensitivity issues seen in PMDD."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 (Autoimmune Intersections), what is the clinical significance of TPO antibodies in a woman with 'normal' TSH who is struggling with recurrent early pregnancy loss?",
            "options": [
                "TPO antibodies have no impact on fertility if TSH is under 4.0 mIU/L.",
                "The presence of thyroid antibodies, even with normal TSH, is associated with a 2-3x higher risk of miscarriage.",
                "TPO antibodies directly attack the developing corpus luteum.",
                "Antibodies only matter if the client also has Celiac disease."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that thyroid autoimmunity (the presence of TPO or TG antibodies) is an independent risk factor for miscarriage and infertility, even when thyroid function (TSH/T4) appears within the standard reference range."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Which factor is a primary driver of 'Lean' PCOS (L7) that distinguishes it from the classic insulin-resistant phenotype?",
            "options": [
                "High intake of complex carbohydrates.",
                "Low levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH).",
                "Elevated adrenal androgens (DHEA-S) and chronic low-grade inflammation (high-sensitivity CRP).",
                "Excessive subcutaneous fat storage in the lower body."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lean PCOS is often driven more by adrenal androgen excess and hypothalamic signaling issues related to stress or inflammation rather than the primary insulin resistance seen in overweight phenotypes."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), discussed in Lesson 8, expands on the 'Female Athlete Triad' by including which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Only amenorrhea and bone mineral density.",
                "Metabolic rate, immunity, protein synthesis, and cardiovascular health.",
                "A requirement that the athlete must be at a professional level.",
                "The exclusion of psychological factors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S is a more comprehensive term than the Female Athlete Triad because it recognizes that low energy availability affects almost every system in the body, not just menstruation and bone health."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client presents with Adenomyosis and 'histamine-like' symptoms (flushing, headaches) during ovulation and the premenstrual phase. What is a recommended practical intervention (L3)?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing intake of fermented foods like sauerkraut and kombucha.",
                "A temporary low-histamine diet combined with calcium-d-glucarate to support estrogen clearance.",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) 5 days a week.",
                "Eliminating all dietary fats to reduce prostaglandin production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-histamine diet reduces the 'bucket' of histamine, while calcium-d-glucarate supports the glucuronidation pathway of estrogen detoxification, addressing both sides of the histamine-estrogen loop."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "When restoring the Infradian Rhythm in a high-performance athlete with amenorrhea (L8), what is the 'Gold Standard' for Energy Availability (EA) to support reproductive function?",
            "options": [
                "15 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day.",
                "At least 45 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day.",
                "A flat 1,200 calories per day regardless of activity.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For female athletes, maintaining energy availability of approximately 45 kcal/kg of FFM/day is considered optimal for maintaining metabolic and reproductive health."
