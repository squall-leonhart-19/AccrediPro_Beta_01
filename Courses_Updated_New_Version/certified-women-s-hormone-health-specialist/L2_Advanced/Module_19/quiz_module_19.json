                "Peer-reviewed research, clinical expertise, and patient values/preferences",
                "Laboratory data, pharmaceutical guidelines, and historical medical texts",

            "question": "Modern re-analysis of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data led to the 'Timing Hypothesis.' What does this hypothesis propose regarding Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)?",
            "options": [
                "HRT should only be used for a maximum of 24 months regardless of age.",
                "HRT is most effective and carries lower cardiovascular risk when initiated within 10 years of menopause onset.",
                "The time of day HRT is administered is the primary factor in bone density retention.",
                "HRT is only safe for women over the age of 75 who have never used hormones before."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Timing Hypothesis suggests that the cardiovascular benefits of HRT are observed when therapy is started close to the onset of menopause (under age 60 or within 10 years of onset), whereas starting it much later may carry higher risks."

            "question": "Research on the HPA-HPO-HPT cross-talk indicates that chronic activation of the stress response (HPA axis) can lead to 'Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea' primarily by inhibiting which signaling molecule?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic HPA axis activation increases cortisol, which inhibits the secretion of Kisspeptin in the hypothalamus, the master regulator of GnRH and the entire reproductive axis."

            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to the collection of gut bacteria capable of metabolizing estrogens. Which enzyme produced by these bacteria can deconjugate estrogen, leading to its reabsorption into the bloodstream?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",

                "Pepsin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the enzyme produced by specific gut microbes that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the hormone to be reabsorbed (enterohepatic circulation) instead of excreted."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myo-inositol (often in a 40:1 ratio with D-chiro-inositol) has extensive clinical evidence for improving insulin signaling and promoting regular ovulation in PCOS populations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low HRV is a clinical indicator of a reduced parasympathetic response and a state of chronic sympathetic nervous system dominance, which negatively impacts the neuroendocrine system."

            "question": "Regarding Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) and 'Emerging Science,' what does the term 'non-monotonic dose-response' imply?",
            "options": [
                "The higher the dose, the more toxic the effect always is.",
                "The chemical only has an effect if taken at exactly 12:00 PM.",
                "Low doses can sometimes cause more significant endocrine disruption than higher doses.",
                "The chemical has no effect on the body until a threshold of 10 years of exposure is met."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EDCs often follow a non-monotonic dose-response curve, meaning they do not follow the traditional toxicological rule that 'the dose makes the poison'; very low levels can interfere with hormone receptors more than high levels."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The long-term follow-up of the WHI showed that women in the Estrogen-only group (typically those without a uterus) actually had a significant reduction in breast cancer incidence and mortality compared to placebo."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Light exposure at night suppresses melatonin production by the pineal gland (governed by the SCN). Melatonin is neuroprotective to the ovaries and helps regulate the timing of LH surges."
