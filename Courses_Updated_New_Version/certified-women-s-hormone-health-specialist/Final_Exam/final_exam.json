            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Endocrine Synergy Evaluation focuses on the TAO axis (Thyroid-Adrenal-Ovarian interplay), recognizing that dysfunction in one gland often cascades into the others."

        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "According to the 'S' (Stabilizing Metabolic Foundations) pillar, what percentage of women with PCOS are estimated to have underlying insulin resistance, regardless of body weight?",

                "Exactly 50%",
                "Approximately 70-80%",
                "Over 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 70-80% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance, making metabolic stabilization a primary clinical priority in the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During Phase II liver detoxification (Optimizing Metabolic Clearance), which pathway is primarily responsible for the neutralization of estrogen metabolites before excretion?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methylation, mediated by the COMT enzyme, is a critical Phase II pathway that converts potentially DNA-damaging estrogen metabolites (like 4-OH) into stable, water-soluble forms."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Regulating the Nervous System' (R), how does chronic HPA-axis activation typically affect progesterone production in the luteal phase?",
            "options": [
                "It increases progesterone to counteract cortisol",
                "It has no direct effect on progesterone levels",
                "It may lead to 'progesterone resistance' or lower production by inhibiting GnRH pulsatility",
                "It stimulates the corpus luteum to extend its lifespan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and elevated cortisol can disrupt the GnRH pulse generator, leading to suboptimal LH surges and subsequent low progesterone production or 'luteal phase defect.'"

                "It decreases by 5% to conserve energy",
                "It increases by approximately 5-10% (roughly 100-300 calories)",
                "It remains stagnant throughout all four phases",
                "It increases by 25% due to the thermogenic effect of estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone is thermogenic, raising the basal body temperature and increasing metabolic demand by 5-10% during the luteal phase, necessitating caloric adjustments."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "When performing 'Root Cause Discovery' (R) for a client with secondary dysmenorrhea, which clinical 'red flag' most strongly suggests Endometriosis rather than simple primary cramping?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Endometriosis often presents with pain outside of just the menstrual flow (dyschezia, dyspareunia, or ovulatory pain) and is frequently resistant to standard NSAID therapy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is produced by certain gut bacteria; when elevated, it 'unclips' the glucuronic acid from estrogen, allowing the hormone to be reabsorbed (enterohepatic circulation) rather than excreted."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'wired but tired' energy, mid-section weight gain, and salt cravings. Within the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework, which stage of HPA-axis dysfunction is most likely?",

        {
            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "During the perimenopausal transition, what is the primary reason for the dramatic fluctuations in estrogen levels?",

                "Insulin levels drop significantly, causing an estrogen spike"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As ovarian reserve declines, the brain sends higher levels of FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) to the ovaries. The remaining follicles may over-respond, creating 'estrogen surges' followed by sharp drops."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_11",
            "question": "In the 'Targeted Nutritional Support' (T) protocol for the Follicular Phase, why is the inclusion of phytoestrogens like flaxseeds recommended?",
            "options": [
                "To completely block all estrogen receptors",

                "To increase testosterone levels for better libido"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lignans in flaxseeds act as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), providing a buffering effect that can help balance estrogen levels during the follicular phase."
        },

                "Respiratory Rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats; a higher HRV generally indicates better parasympathetic 'brake' function and nervous system resilience."

                "An early morning surge in melatonin",
                "A rise in blood sugar in the early morning caused by the natural release of cortisol and growth hormone",
                "The drop in progesterone that triggers menstruation",
                "The peak of LH during the ovulatory window"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dawn Phenomenon is a natural rise in blood glucose as the body prepares for wakefulness by releasing cortisol, which triggers the liver to release stored glucose."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs are exogenous substances that interfere with any aspect of endogenous hormones, often by binding to receptors (like estrogen receptors) and sending 'false signals'."

            "id": "final_17",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' theory has been largely updated in modern endocrinology to focus more on:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'steal' is a common term, modern science shows it's less about 'running out' of pregnenolone and more about the brain signaling the adrenals to prioritize cortisol production over sex hormones during stress."
