            "question": "The 'R' in the RESTORE™ Framework stands for 'Replenish.' What is the primary clinical focus during this initial phase of program development?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive detoxification of endocrine disruptors",
                "Restoring micronutrient status, caloric sufficiency, and mineral balance",

                "Advanced cycle syncing for athletic performance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Replenish phase focuses on building the physiological 'floor' by ensuring the body has the raw materials (nutrients and calories) required for hormone synthesis and HPA-axis stability."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Strategic Sequencing' principle, why is it considered a clinical error to implement intensive 'Optimization' protocols (like fasting or heavy HIIT) before 'Foundations' are established?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the client to lose interest in the program",
                "It is too expensive for the average client to maintain",
                "The body lacks the metabolic resources to adapt, often leading to 'Biological Redlining' and HPA-axis depletion",
                "Optimization protocols only work if the client is already at 100% health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Foundations provide the resilience needed to handle the stress of optimization; without them, the body perceives optimization protocols as additional stressors, worsening hormonal imbalances."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "When customizing protocols for the 'Hyper-Androgenic' clinical phenotype (PCOS-type), which physiological mechanism should be prioritized first in the RESTORE™ sequence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In most hyper-androgenic phenotypes, hyperinsulinemia is the primary driver of ovarian androgen production; therefore, insulin sensitization is the foundational priority."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ringelmann Effect describes the tendency for individual effort to decrease as group size increases; individual accountability and visibility help maintain engagement."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fasting and caloric restriction are metabolic stressors that can further deplete a client in a low-cortisol/burnout state and should be avoided or introduced only after full recovery."
