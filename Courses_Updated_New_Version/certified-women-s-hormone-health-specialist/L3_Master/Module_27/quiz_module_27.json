            "question": "In the context of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) in elite female athletes, what is the primary physiological mechanism leading to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive production of prolactin from high-intensity training",
                "Suppression of GnRH pulsatility due to low energy availability",
                "Direct inhibition of the ovaries by elevated cortisol levels",
                "Increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen in muscle tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S occurs when energy intake is insufficient to support physiological functions. This energy deficit suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, specifically inhibiting the pulsatile release of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)."

            "question": "A client with ADHD reports a significant 'brain fog' and a total loss of medication efficacy during the 5-7 days prior to menstruation. Based on neuroendocrine integration, what is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone's sedative effect on the prefrontal cortex",
                "The drop in estrogen, which reduces dopamine receptor sensitivity and synthesis",
                "Excessive testosterone levels during the late luteal phase",
                "A spike in GABA production that interferes with stimulant medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen modulates dopamine signaling. When estrogen levels drop during the late luteal phase, dopamine availability and receptor sensitivity decrease, often exacerbating ADHD symptoms and reducing the effectiveness of stimulant medications."

            "question": "Surgical menopause (bilateral oophorectomy) differs from natural menopause primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "It results in a 50% decline in circulating testosterone levels overnight",
                "The adrenal glands immediately compensate for the loss of ovarian hormones",
                "Symptoms are generally milder due to the removal of the uterus",
                "FSH levels remain low because the ovaries are no longer present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Unlike natural menopause where the ovaries continue to produce small amounts of androgens, surgical removal of the ovaries causes an immediate and permanent 50% drop in circulating testosterone, contributing to more severe vasomotor symptoms and sexual dysfunction."

            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Estrogen Paradox' in autoimmune disease management?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen always suppresses the immune system regardless of the disease type",
                "Low estrogen levels are required to put Rheumatoid Arthritis into remission",
                "Estrogen can stimulate B-cell responses (bad for Lupus) but suppress Th1 responses (good for MS)",
                "Estrogen has no effect on the immune system; only progesterone is immunomodulatory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is immunomodulatory. It generally enhances B-cell activity (which can flare Th2-dominant diseases like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) but suppresses Th1-mediated inflammation (which can improve conditions like Multiple Sclerosis or Rheumatoid Arthritis)."

            "question": "Post-bariatric surgery clients are at an increased risk for 'malabsorptive hormonal disruption.' Which nutrient deficiency is most critical to monitor for thyroid hormone conversion?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Selenium and Zinc",
                "Calcium",
                "Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bariatric procedures often lead to malabsorption of trace minerals. Selenium and Zinc are essential cofactors for the deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 (inactive) to T3 (active thyroid hormone)."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "For a high-stress executive, a 'blunted' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) on a functional salivary test typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Acute, high-level stress that is currently manageable",
                "Hyper-functioning adrenal glands producing excess DHEA",
                "HPA axis exhaustion or burnout, where the body can no longer mount an appropriate morning stress response",
                "Optimal circadian rhythm regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 50-75% rise in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A 'blunted' or flat CAR is a hallmark of HPA axis dysregulation and chronic burnout, reflecting a failure of the system to 'prime' the body for the day."

            "question": "How do Phthalates, a common Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC), primarily affect female reproductive health?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the half-life of progesterone in the blood",
                "By acting as anti-androgens and interfering with follicle maturation",
                "By permanently destroying the thyroid gland",
                "By preventing the liver from processing any fat-soluble vitamins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are known to interfere with steroidogenesis. In women, they can act as anti-androgens and disrupt the delicate balance of hormones required for healthy follicular development and ovulation."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "When optimizing egg quality for reproductive longevity, why is a 90-day protocol recommended?",
            "options": [
                "Because that is how long it takes for the liver to detoxify estrogen",
                "It takes approximately 90 days for a primordial follicle to reach the pre-ovulatory stage, during which it is sensitive to the environment",
                "It takes 90 days for progesterone receptors to reset",
                "The uterine lining requires 3 full cycles to thicken adequately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'recruitment' and maturation process of an egg (folliculogenesis) takes about 3-4 months. During this 90-120 day window, the oocyte is highly susceptible to oxidative stress, nutrient availability, and hormonal balance."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Which clinical intervention is most appropriate for a client with 'Executive Burnout' showing high evening cortisol and low secretory IgA (sIgA)?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) at 8:00 PM",
                "Intermittent fasting with a 20-hour fasting window",
                "Phosphatidylserine in the evening and stress-reduction techniques to support mucosal immunity",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to boost morning energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phosphatidylserine helps dampen inappropriate evening cortisol spikes. Low sIgA indicates that chronic stress has suppressed the first line of immune defense (mucosal immunity), making stress reduction and gut support vital."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the course suggests that women with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) may have a cellular hypersensitivity to:",

                "Total absence of estrogen",
                "Synthetic progestins found in all birth control"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that PMDD is not typically caused by 'abnormal' hormone levels, but rather a genetic/cellular hypersensitivity to normal fluctuations of allopregnanolone, which affects the GABA-A receptors in the brain."
