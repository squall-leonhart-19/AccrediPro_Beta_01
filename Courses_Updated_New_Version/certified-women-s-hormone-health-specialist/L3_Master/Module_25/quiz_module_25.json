                "To ensure the practitioner is following exact dosing protocols for bioidentical hormones.",
                "To provide emotional support and prevent compassion fatigue or burnout in the practitioner.",
                "To audit the financial performance and client retention rates of the specialist.",
                "To teach new scientific concepts that the practitioner may have missed in initial training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The restorative function (Proctor’s Model) focuses on the well-being of the practitioner, helping them process the emotional impact of clinical work to prevent burnout and maintain high-quality care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Endocrine Synergy requires understanding how different glands interact. Treating the thyroid in isolation without considering the HPA axis (cortisol) is a common clinical oversight that 'E' auditing aims to correct."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormone specialists must never direct a client to discontinue or alter physician-prescribed medication; this is a major scope of practice violation and a significant legal risk."
