            "question": "A client with a known history of Graves' disease presents with a heart rate of 145 bpm, a temperature of 103.5°F, and acute delirium. Which endocrine emergency must be suspected immediately?",
            "options": [
                "Severe Estrogen Dominance",
                "Thyroid Storm",
                "Myxedema Coma",
                "Acute Adrenal Insufficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid Storm is a life-threatening hypermetabolic state characterized by tachycardia, hyperpyrexia (high fever), and central nervous system dysfunction (delirium/agitation)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "When troubleshooting a 'Stagnant Client' who has failed to respond to standard hormone balancing protocols, which 'Hidden Root Cause' is most likely to trigger a persistent Cell Danger Response (CDR)?",
            "options": [
                "Biotoxin illness (e.g., Mold/CIRS)",
                "Occasional sleep deprivation",
                "Low dietary fiber intake",
                "Mild Vitamin D deficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Biotoxin illness, such as mold exposure or Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), keeps the mitochondria in a defensive state (CDR), preventing hormonal and metabolic recovery despite proper nutrition."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Hashitoxicosis is clinically distinguished from permanent Graves' disease by which of the following mechanisms?",
            "options": [
                "It is caused by TSH-receptor stimulating antibodies",
                "It results in permanent hyperthyroidism",
                "It is a transient leak of thyroid hormone caused by autoimmune follicle destruction",
                "It requires lifelong anti-thyroid medication (Methimazole)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hashitoxicosis is a temporary thyrotoxic state that occurs when the immune system attacks thyroid follicles, causing stored hormone to 'leak' into the bloodstream before the client eventually returns to a hypothyroid state."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "In cases of Recalcitrant Metabolic Dysfunction, a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score above which level indicates severe, systemic resistance requiring advanced intervention?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While a HOMA-IR > 1.9 indicates early resistance, a score > 5.0 represents severe, recalcitrant insulin resistance often seen in complex metabolic cases."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "What is the primary clinical difference between PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) and PME (Premenstrual Exacerbation)?",
            "options": [
                "PMDD is purely physical, whereas PME is purely psychological",
                "PME involves the cyclical worsening of an underlying disorder (e.g., MDD or Bipolar), while PMDD symptoms resolve after menses",
                "PMDD only occurs in women over 40, while PME occurs in younger women",
                "PME is caused by high progesterone, while PMDD is caused by low estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PME is the premenstrual worsening of a chronic condition (like depression or anxiety) that persists throughout the cycle; PMDD is a specific cyclical reaction to hormone fluctuations that resolves during the follicular phase."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A client in 'Estrogen Clearance Crisis' presents with severe mastalgia and irritability. Her stool testing shows elevated Beta-glucuronidase. What is the physiological consequence of this elevation?",
            "options": [
                "Increased excretion of estrogen in the feces",
                "De-conjugation of estrogen in the gut, leading to reabsorption into circulation",

                "Suppression of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-couples' estrogen that the liver has already processed, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream instead of excreted."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Trauma-Hormone Loop' (Lesson 7), how does chronic developmental trauma (ACEs) typically impact the adult HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "It leads to a permanent state of high cortisol that never drops",
                "It has no measurable impact on hormonal health in adulthood",
                "It often results in 'hypocortisolism' or a blunted cortisol awakening response (CAR) due to chronic over-activation",
                "It increases the sensitivity of the ovaries to LH and FSH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term trauma often leads to a 'burnt out' HPA axis characterized by hypocortisolism (low cortisol) and a blunted CAR as a protective down-regulation mechanism."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which intervention is considered a 'High-Risk' strategy when managing a client currently in an active autoimmune flare?",

                "Utilizing Epsom salt baths for magnesium absorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In active autoimmune flares, high-dose iodine or potent immune stimulants (like Echinacea) can exacerbate the immune attack on the thyroid or other tissues, worsening the crisis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD) mandates prospective daily rating (tracking symptoms as they happen) for two cycles to confirm the cyclical nature of PMDD."

                "Only charge 5% of their normal rate for complex cases",

                "Spend 5% of the session on symptoms and 95% on mindset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex and highly sensitive cases, small, incremental changes (the 5% rule) are necessary to avoid overwhelming a fragile nervous system or triggering a severe inflammatory flare."
