            "question": "According to Lesson 1 on Authority Positioning, why is 'niching down' to a specific condition (e.g., PCOS) more profitable than being a generalist hormone coach?",
            "options": [
                "It allows you to charge lower prices to attract more people",
                "It reduces marketing costs by targeting a broader audience",
                "It increases perceived expertise and allows for premium 'specialist' pricing",
                "It is a legal requirement for hormone health certification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specialization creates 'Category Authority.' When you solve a specific, high-pain problem like PCOS or perimenopause, you are viewed as an expert rather than a generalist, allowing you to command premium rates and reduce competition."

                "I can help you get off your hormone replacement therapy (HRT) medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To remain compliant, specialists must use 'structure/function' claims (e.g., 'supports,' 'promotes,' 'maintains') rather than 'disease' claims (e.g., 'cure,' 'treat,' 'diagnose')."

                "To explain the complex enzymatic pathways of cortisol",
                "To encourage the client to buy a product immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empathy in the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework is about building rapport by demonstrating that you understand the client's lived experience, which is essential for conversion in the sensitive field of hormone health."

                "To fill the silence while the specialist reviews the client's labs",
                "To compare your services to a competitor's services"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Gap' is the psychological space between where the client is (pain) and where they want to be (pleasure). High-ticket enrollment depends on the client acknowledging that they cannot bridge this gap without expert help."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic partnerships work best when there is 'Audience Alignment.' An acupuncturist specializing in reproductive health shares the exact same target demographic but offers a complementary (non-competing) service."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Video testimonials provide 'social proof' with emotional nuance. Seeing and hearing another woman describe her hormonal transformation builds significantly more trust than anonymous text."
