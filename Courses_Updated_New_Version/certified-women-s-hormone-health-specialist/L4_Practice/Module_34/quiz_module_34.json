            "question": "When scaling the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™ for group dynamics, what is the primary purpose of the 'Foundational Stabilization' phase during the first 2 weeks?",
            "options": [
                "To introduce advanced bio-identical hormone replacement concepts",
                "To synchronize the group's circadian rhythms and blood sugar baselines to ensure safety before deeper interventions",
                "To conduct individual lab reviews for every member simultaneously",
                "To sell high-ticket supplements to the entire group at once"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization is the first step in scaling the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™, ensuring all participants have a safe metabolic and adrenal baseline before moving into complex hormonal shifts."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Curriculum Architecture' lesson, why should a 12-week hormone program address the HPA axis and Gut Health before focusing on Estrogen/Progesterone balance?",
            "options": [
                "Because sex hormones are easier to fix and should be saved for the end",
                "Because clients are usually more interested in gut health than sex hormones",
                "Because the 'Hormonal Hierarchy' dictates that cortisol and insulin dysregulation will undermine sex hormone protocols if not addressed first",
                "Because it takes exactly 8 weeks for gut lining to repair before hormones can be absorbed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hormonal Hierarchy is a core concept; foundational systems like the HPA axis (stress) and insulin must be stabilized to allow for successful sex hormone modulation."

            "question": "In the context of 'Facilitating Bio-Individuality,' how does a specialist manage different PCOS phenotypes within a single group program?",
            "options": [
                "By providing a single 'Gold Standard' protocol that everyone must follow",
                "By using 'Tiered Protocols' or 'Branching Logic' within the curriculum to allow for individual adjustments",
                "By ignoring the differences and focusing only on general weight loss",
                "By requiring all participants to purchase the same 5 supplements regardless of phenotype"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tiered protocols allow the specialist to scale their expertise while still respecting the bio-individual needs (e.g., inflammatory PCOS vs. insulin-resistant PCOS) of group members."

            "question": "What neurobiological benefit does 'Peer Support' provide that specifically aids in hormone regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It increases adrenaline, which helps with thyroid function",
                "It triggers oxytocin release, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the HPA axis and lowers cortisol",
                "It decreases dopamine, making people more compliant with restrictive diets",
                "Peer support has no biological effect on hormones; it is purely psychological"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin released during positive social interaction acts as a natural buffer to the stress response, helping to lower systemic cortisol and support hormonal healing."

            "options": [
                "To upsell the client to a more expensive program",
                "To review the client's unique lab data and 'onboard' them into the group curriculum with personalized modifications",
                "To replace the need for any group interaction later on",
                "To conduct a psychological screening for group fit only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid Model uses private sessions to personalize the experience, ensuring the client knows exactly how to apply the group's general education to their specific lab results."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adult learning theory suggests that retention increases significantly when participants immediately apply the knowledge through worksheets, self-assessments, or group exercises."
