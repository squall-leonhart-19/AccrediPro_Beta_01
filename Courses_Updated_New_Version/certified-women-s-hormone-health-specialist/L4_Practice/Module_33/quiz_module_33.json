            "options": [
                "\"Your low progesterone is the cause of your insomnia, so we need to fix that.\"",
                "\"These results suggest your body is metabolizing estrogen through the 4-OH pathway, which increases your cancer risk.\"",
                "\"Your results show markers that correlate with low progesterone support; we will focus on lifestyle shifts to optimize your natural hormone production.\"",
                "\"I am diagnosing you with Estrogen Dominance based on this specific ratio.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To stay within the scope of practice, specialists must use 'educational' language rather than 'diagnostic' language. Terms like 'correlate with,' 'support,' and 'optimize' are compliant, whereas 'diagnose,' 'cause,' and 'fix' imply medical practice."
