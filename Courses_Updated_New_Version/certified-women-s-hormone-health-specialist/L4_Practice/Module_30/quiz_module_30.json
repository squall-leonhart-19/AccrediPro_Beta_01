            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Strategic Positioning' is emphasized as a way to avoid the 'commodity trap.' Why is a premium niche specifically effective for hormone health practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to see 40+ clients per week at a lower price point",
                "It eliminates the need for any formal certification or legal disclaimers",
                "It positions the practitioner as a specialist solving a high-stakes, specific problem, increasing perceived value",
                "It focuses exclusively on selling supplements rather than coaching services"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Premium positioning moves the practitioner away from being a generalist 'commodity' and into a specialist role where they solve specific, complex hormonal issues, justifying higher fees and better client commitment."

                "'I am diagnosing you with Estrogen Dominance and prescribing 200mg of Progesterone.'",
                "'These labs prove you have PCOS, so we will begin a medical treatment protocol immediately.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-medical practitioners must avoid 'diagnosing' or 'treating' medical conditions. They should instead 'identify patterns' and 'educate' on lifestyle and nutritional support within their scope."

            "id": "q30_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Program Architecture.' Why is a 3-month (90-day) minimum transformation period biologically recommended for hormone health clients?",
            "options": [
                "Because it takes 90 days for the practitioner's insurance to become active",
                "Because clients usually quit after the first 30 days regardless of results",
                "Because the maturation process of an egg (oogenesis) takes approximately 90 days, making it the minimum time to see cycle changes",
                "Because marketing algorithms only favor programs that are 12 weeks or longer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biological cycles, particularly the 90-day maturation of the follicle/egg and the lifespan of red blood cells, dictate that true hormonal and systemic change requires at least three months to manifest."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "General Liability covers 'slip and fall' or physical office accidents, whereas Professional Liability (E&O) protects the practitioner if a client claims they were harmed by the specific health advice or protocols provided."
