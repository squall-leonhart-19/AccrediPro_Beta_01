            "question": "A client with PCOS presents with insulin resistance and elevated testosterone. According to the macronutrient guidelines in Lesson 2, which ratio is most effective for improving insulin sensitivity while maintaining endocrine precursors?",
            "options": [
                "60% Carbohydrates, 20% Protein, 20% Fat",
                "10% Carbohydrates, 45% Protein, 45% Fat",
                "30-40% Low-Glycemic Carbohydrates, 30% Protein, 30% Healthy Fats",
                "50% Carbohydrates, 10% Protein, 40% Fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A balanced ratio of 30-40% low-glycemic carbs with 30% each of protein and fat helps stabilize blood sugar, reduces insulin spikes that drive ovarian androgen production, and provides enough fat for steroid hormone synthesis."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Which specific enzyme, responsible for the peripheral conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone, is a selenoprotein that requires adequate Selenium to function?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "Iodothyronine Deiodinase",
                "Aromatase",
                "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The deiodinase enzymes (D1, D2, and D3) are selenoproteins. Without adequate selenium, the body cannot efficiently convert the pro-hormone T4 into the metabolically active T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In the context of estrogen detoxification (Lesson 4), the COMT enzyme requires which specific nutrient as a mandatory cofactor to methylate and neutralize 2-OH and 4-OH catechol estrogens?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium",
                "Iron",
                "Vitamin E"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is a critical cofactor for the COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) enzyme. Without magnesium and SAMe, the body cannot effectively methylate estrogens into their water-soluble forms for excretion."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of hyperprolactinemia and a short luteal phase. Based on the micronutrient protocols in Lesson 4, which B-vitamin acts as a dopamine agonist to help lower prolactin and boost progesterone?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)",
                "Vitamin B9 (Folate)",
                "Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate)",
                "Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B6, particularly in its active P5P form, is known to modulate dopamine production, which inhibits the release of prolactin, subsequently supporting better LH signaling and progesterone production."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, what is the 'functional' target range for serum ferritin in menstruating women to ensure optimal thyroid function and hair growth, as opposed to the standard laboratory 'normal' range?",
            "options": [
                "12–150 ng/mL",
                "70–100 ng/mL",
                "20–30 ng/mL",
                "Over 200 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While lab ranges consider 12-15 ng/mL 'normal,' functional hormone health requires ferritin levels between 70-100 ng/mL for optimal T3 utilization in the cells and to prevent telogen effluvium (hair shedding)."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), found in Evening Primrose Oil and Black Currant Seed Oil, is unique because it bypasses the rate-limiting D6D enzyme to promote the production of which anti-inflammatory prostaglandin?",
            "options": [
                "PGE2 (Prostaglandin E2)",
                "PGF2-alpha",
                "PGE1 (Prostaglandin E1)",
                "Thromboxane A2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GLA is converted into DGLA, which is the direct precursor to PGE1, a potent anti-inflammatory prostaglandin that helps reduce uterine cramping and breast tenderness."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, CoQ10 (Ubiquinol) is highlighted for its role in 'Ovarian Reserve Support.' What is the primary mechanism by which it improves oocyte quality in women over 35?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the total number of follicles",
                "By blocking the production of FSH",
                "By enhancing mitochondrial ATP production and reducing oxidative stress in the follicular fluid",
                "By converting testosterone into estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 supports the high energy demands of the oocyte during maturation and meiosis by enhancing mitochondrial ATP production, which declines with age."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A client following a long-term, very-low-carbohydrate diet (<20g/day) complains of fatigue, cold intolerance, and thinning hair. Why might this macronutrient strategy be failing her endocrine system?",
            "options": [
                "Carbohydrates are required for the synthesis of cortisol",
                "Insulin is a necessary signal for the liver to convert T4 into active T3",
                "Low carb diets increase SHBG too much",
                "Fat is more important than carbs for thyroid health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A certain amount of insulin is required to facilitate the conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver. Chronic low insulin levels from extreme carbohydrate restriction can lead to 'Euthyroid Sick Syndrome' or low T3 levels."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "Which form of Magnesium is specifically recommended in Lesson 5 for clients with PMS-related anxiety and insomnia due to its high bioavailability and gentle effect on the GI tract?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium Oxide",
                "Magnesium Citrate",
                "Magnesium Bisglycinate",
                "Magnesium Sulfate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium Bisglycinate (magnesium bound to glycine) is highly absorbable and has a calming effect on the nervous system without the laxative effect common in the citrate or oxide forms."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "When applying the T-Phase (Targeted) Framework from Lesson 8, what is the 'Golden Rule' of supplementation priority?",
            "options": [
                "Always start with high-dose antioxidants like NAC",
                "Address blood sugar stability and micronutrient deficiencies before introducing herbal hormone modulators",
                "Introduce at least 10 supplements at once to ensure a result",
                "Prioritize weight loss supplements over hormonal health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The T-Phase framework emphasizes that foundations (blood sugar and basic micronutrients) must be corrected first. Introducing potent herbs into a nutrient-depleted or blood-sugar-unstable system often leads to side effects or poor outcomes."
