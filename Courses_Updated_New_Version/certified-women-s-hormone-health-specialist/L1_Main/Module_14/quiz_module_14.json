            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which mechanism best describes how Environmental Endocrine Disruptors (EEDs) like Phthalates contribute to 'hormonal mimicry'?",
            "options": [
                "They bind to hormone receptors and trigger a response identical to or stronger than the endogenous hormone.",
                "They permanently destroy the receptor site, preventing any future hormone binding.",
                "They increase the half-life of endogenous hormones by 500%.",
                "They only affect the pituitary gland and have no peripheral receptor activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "EEDs function through hormonal mimicry by binding to hormone receptors (like estrogen receptors) and activating them, often leading to inappropriate or over-stimulated cellular responses."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the Thyroid-Gut-Liver axis, what percentage of T4 to T3 conversion typically occurs in the liver, and which process is required for its excretion?",
            "options": [
                "20%; Methylation",
                "40%; Acetylation",
                "60%; Glucuronidation and Sulfation",
                "80%; Hydrolysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The liver is responsible for approximately 60% of peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. For thyroid hormones (and estrogens) to be excreted, they must undergo Phase II detoxification, specifically glucuronidation and sulfation."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Lean PCOS' (Phenotype C). She has a normal BMI and no signs of insulin resistance, but exhibits high DHEA-S and hirsutism. What is the likely primary driver?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive intake of refined carbohydrates",
                "Adrenal androgen excess and HPA-axis dysregulation",
                "Thyroid peroxidase antibodies",
                "Low Vitamin D levels only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lean PCOS often manifests as the 'Adrenal Phenotype,' where the primary driver is HPA-axis dysregulation leading to excessive adrenal androgen (DHEA-S) production rather than insulin-driven ovarian androgen production."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In the context of Endometriosis, what is the significance of 'Progesterone Resistance' at the cellular level?",
            "options": [
                "The body produces too much progesterone, causing the receptors to shut down.",
                "Endometrial lesions show a downregulation of Progesterone Receptor B (PR-B), preventing progesterone from counteracting estrogen-driven growth.",
                "Progesterone is converted into estrogen within the lesion via the aromatase enzyme.",
                "Progesterone resistance only occurs during pregnancy and does not affect endometriosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone resistance in endometriosis is characterized by a deficiency or downregulation of Progesterone Receptor B (PR-B) in ectopic lesions, which prevents progesterone from inhibiting the proliferative effects of estrogen."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "During the neuroendocrine transition of perimenopause, the decline in Allopregnanolone (a metabolite of progesterone) directly affects which neurotransmitter system?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Dopamine, leading to better focus.",
                "It decreases GABAergic signaling, leading to increased anxiety and sleep disturbances.",
                "It inhibits Glutamate, causing 'brain fog'.",
                "It has no effect on the brain; it only affects the uterus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors. As progesterone drops in perimenopause, GABAergic signaling decreases, often resulting in the hallmark symptoms of anxiety and insomnia."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Post-Pill Syndrome (PPS) is often characterized by a temporary surge in androgens. What is a common underlying cause of this 'androgen rebound'?",
            "options": [
                "The pill increases the size of the ovaries.",
                "The sudden withdrawal of synthetic progestins leads to an up-regulation of androgen receptors and a drop in SHBG.",
                "The pill causes the liver to produce more testosterone.",
                "Synthetic estrogens are converted into testosterone once the pill is stopped."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pill suppresses androgens and increases Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). Upon cessation, SHBG levels drop and androgen receptors may be hypersensitive, leading to a rebound of 'free' androgens and symptoms like acne."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes a 'blunted' or flat Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) in a client with chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates a healthy, highly resilient HPA-axis.",
                "It is a sign of acute, short-term stress that will resolve in 24 hours.",
                "It indicates reduced HPA-axis plasticity and is often associated with burnout or chronic fatigue syndrome.",
                "It means the client is consuming too much caffeine in the morning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR is a 50-75% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A 'blunted' or flat response indicates that the HPA-axis has lost its dynamic range and plasticity due to chronic allostatic load."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In the RANKL/OPG pathway of bone metabolism, how does Estrogen maintain bone density?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen stimulates RANKL to increase bone resorption.",
                "Estrogen increases the production of Osteoprotegerin (OPG), which acts as a decoy receptor to block RANKL from activating osteoclasts.",
                "Estrogen directly dissolves calcium into the bloodstream.",
                "Estrogen inhibits osteoblasts from forming new bone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen promotes the production of Osteoprotegerin (OPG). OPG binds to RANKL, preventing RANKL from binding to its receptor on osteoclasts, thereby inhibiting excessive bone resorption."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis has optimal TSH and T4 levels but high Reverse T3 (rT3) and symptoms of hypothyroidism. Which clinical intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the dose of Levothyroxine (T4).",
                "Investigate systemic inflammation, gut dysbiosis, or high cortisol levels that may be shunting T4 to rT3.",
                "Recommend a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program 7 days a week.",
                "Suggest she stop taking all thyroid medication immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High rT3 is often a 'physiological brake' caused by non-thyroidal illness, inflammation, or high cortisol. Addressing the root cause of the shunting (inflammation/stress) is more effective than simply adding more T4."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Post-Pill Syndrome, which three nutrients are most commonly depleted by long-term oral contraceptive use?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Calcium",
                "Vitamin B6, Folate, and Zinc",
                "Iron, Copper, and Sodium",
                "Vitamin A, Vitamin K, and Manganese"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data shows that oral contraceptives significantly deplete B vitamins (especially B6 and Folate), Zinc, and Magnesium, which are essential for mood regulation and hormonal detoxification."
