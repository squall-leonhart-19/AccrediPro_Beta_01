            "question": "The Infradian Rhythm is a biological clock that operates over approximately 28 days. According to the module, how does this rhythm specifically affect a woman's metabolism compared to the 24-hour Circadian rhythm?",
            "options": [
                "Metabolism remains static throughout the month, similar to the male 24-hour cycle.",
                "Metabolic rate increases by 5-10% during the luteal phase, requiring higher caloric intake.",
                "Metabolism peaks during the menstrual phase to provide energy for shedding the lining.",
                "Metabolism slows down significantly during the ovulatory phase to conserve energy for potential conception."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike the male circadian rhythm, the female infradian rhythm causes the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) to increase by 5-10% during the luteal phase due to the thermogenic effect of progesterone."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "During Phase 1 (Menstrual Phase), which physiological shift explains why high-intensity exercise may be counterproductive?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone is at its highest level, causing muscle relaxation.",
                "The body is in a state of 'systemic inflammation' with high prostaglandin levels and low overall hormones.",
                "Estrogen is peaking, which increases the risk of ligament tears.",
                "The body's core temperature is at its highest, leading to rapid overheating."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During menstruation, estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest, and prostaglandins (inflammatory compounds) are high. This creates a physiological environment better suited for rest and recovery rather than high-intensity stress."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In the Follicular Phase (Phase 2), rising estrogen levels have what specific effect on the brain's cognitive function?",
            "options": [
                "It increases activity in the amygdala, leading to higher emotional reactivity.",
                "It suppresses the prefrontal cortex, making logical planning difficult.",
                "It enhances neuroplasticity and stimulates the hippocampus, boosting creativity and new learning.",
                "It reduces verbal fluency to focus on internal reflection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is neuroprotective and stimulates the hippocampus. As it rises in the follicular phase, women often experience improved neuroplasticity, better verbal memory, and a greater capacity for creative problem-solving."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client is planning a high-stakes salary negotiation or a public speaking event. Based on the 'Cycle Superpowers' framework, which phase is most optimal for this activity?",
            "options": [
                "The Menstrual Phase, due to heightened intuition.",
                "The Follicular Phase, due to high focus on solo tasks.",
                "The Ovulatory Phase, due to peak verbal communication and social confidence.",
                "The Luteal Phase, due to attention to detail and critical thinking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ovulatory Phase coincides with a peak in both estrogen and testosterone, which enhances verbal centers in the brain and boosts confidence, making it the 'superpower' phase for communication and networking."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Why is the risk of ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) injuries statistically higher during the Ovulatory Phase?",
            "options": [
                "Low estrogen makes the ligaments brittle.",
                "High progesterone causes excessive muscle tightness.",
                "Peak estrogen levels increase ligament laxity and affect neuromuscular control.",
                "The body is dehydrated during ovulation, leading to joint friction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that peak estrogen levels around ovulation can increase joint laxity (softening of the ligaments) and alter motor control, significantly increasing the risk of ACL injuries in female athletes."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In Phase 4 (Luteal Phase), the body's sensitivity to which hormone decreases, potentially leading to 'hangry' feelings or energy crashes if carbohydrate intake isn't managed?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Insulin",
                "Thyroid Hormone",
                "Oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin sensitivity decreases during the luteal phase. This means the body has to work harder to manage blood sugar, making complex carbohydrates and consistent meals crucial to prevent mood swings and energy crashes."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "When using the cycle for 'Productivity and Workflow,' which phase is best suited for administrative tasks, editing, and completing detailed reports?",
            "options": [
                "Menstrual Phase",
                "Follicular Phase",
                "Ovulatory Phase",
                "Luteal Phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Luteal Phase is characterized by an 'internal' focus and a heightened attention to detail. This makes it the most effective time for 'The Completion Phase'—editing, administrative work, and tieing up loose ends."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Biofeedback, what is the primary indicator that ovulation has successfully occurred when tracking Basal Body Temperature (BBT)?",
            "options": [
                "A significant drop in temperature that stays low for 10 days.",
                "A temperature spike of 0.5 to 1.0 degree Fahrenheit that remains elevated (the thermal shift).",
                "Fluctuating temperatures that change every 24 hours.",
                "A decrease in temperature only during the afternoon hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A sustained 'thermal shift' (an increase of about 0.5–1.0°F) in BBT is caused by the thermogenic effect of progesterone, confirming that ovulation has taken place and the corpus luteum is active."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client in her late Luteal phase reports intense cravings for sweets and feels 'exhausted' after her usual CrossFit class. What is the most appropriate 'Cycle Resilience' coaching adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "Advise her to push through the fatigue to maintain her routine.",
                "Suggest she switch to a ketogenic diet to stop the sugar cravings.",
                "Recommend shifting to LISS (Low-Intensity Steady State) cardio or Yoga and increasing intake of complex carbohydrates.",
                "Tell her to fast for 16 hours to reset her insulin sensitivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the late luteal phase, the body is less resilient to high-intensity stress (cortisol) and requires more calories/complex carbs due to a higher BMR. Shifting to LISS and supporting blood sugar is the evidence-based coaching approach."

        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "The 'Infradian Rhythm' affects the Stress Response (HPA Axis). During which half of the cycle is a woman typically more sensitive to cortisol and prone to burnout if over-scheduled?",
            "options": [
                "The First Half (Follicular/Ovulatory)",
                "The Second Half (Luteal Phase)",
                "Only during the 3 days of menstruation",
                "The sensitivity remains identical across all phases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the Luteal phase, the body is more sensitive to stress. High-intensity exercise or excessive scheduling can more easily trigger the HPA axis, leading to increased cortisol production and potential burnout compared to the Follicular phase."
