            "question": "In the 'Root Cause Paradigm,' how is a symptom like 'heavy menstrual bleeding' viewed differently than in conventional medicine?",
            "options": [
                "As a primary diagnosis requiring immediate surgical intervention.",
                "As a downstream signal of an upstream imbalance, such as impaired hepatic clearance or progesterone deficiency.",
                "As an isolated pelvic issue unrelated to systemic metabolic or gut health.",
                "As a genetic inevitability that cannot be influenced by lifestyle drivers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Root Cause Paradigm views symptoms as 'bio-feedback' or downstream effects of deeper systemic imbalances (upstream drivers) rather than the primary problem itself."

            "question": "When mapping a client's 'Clinical Timeline,' which term refers to the underlying genetic or lifestyle factors that predispose an individual to a hormonal imbalance?",
            "options": [
                "Triggers",
                "Mediators",
                "Antecedents",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Antecedents are the 'pre-conditions' (genetics, birth history, early childhood nutrition) that set the stage for later health outcomes."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client presents with the following symptom cluster: mid-cycle spotting, intense PMS irritability, and fibrocystic breasts. Which hormonal pattern is most strongly indicated?",
            "options": [
                "Androgen Excess",
                "Relative Estrogen Dominance",

                "Subclinical Hypothyroidism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This specific cluster (PMS, breast tenderness, and spotting) is a hallmark of Estrogen Dominance, often caused by low progesterone or poor estrogen metabolism."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Environmental Drivers, what is the primary mechanism by which 'Xenoestrogens' disrupt the endocrine system?",
            "options": [
                "They permanently destroy hormone-producing glands.",
                "They bind to estrogen receptors, either mimicking or blocking natural 17β-estradiol.",
                "They prevent the thyroid from absorbing iodine.",
                "They increase the half-life of insulin in the bloodstream."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that mimic natural estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors, leading to inappropriate hormonal signaling."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "How does chronic hyperinsulinemia (elevated blood sugar/insulin) specifically drive 'Functional Androgen Excess' in women?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG).",
                "It suppresses the ovaries' ability to produce any hormones.",
                "It stimulates the theca cells in the ovaries to produce testosterone and decreases SHBG production.",
                "It converts progesterone directly into cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH to stimulate ovarian theca cells to produce androgens and simultaneously signals the liver to decrease SHBG, increasing 'free' testosterone."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Gut-Hormone Axis,' what is the role of the enzyme 'beta-glucuronidase' within the estrobolome?",
            "options": [
                "It breaks down fiber into short-chain fatty acids.",
                "It deconjugates bound estrogen in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation.",
                "It stimulates the release of bile from the gallbladder.",
                "It prevents the absorption of dietary cholesterol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-couples' estrogen that the liver has tagged for excretion, allowing that estrogen to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, contributing to estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Functional Lab Analysis.' What is the primary difference between a 'Pathological' range and a 'Functional' range?",
            "options": [
                "Functional ranges are wider and less strict than pathological ranges.",
                "Pathological ranges identify disease; functional ranges identify the optimal physiological window for health.",
                "Functional ranges are only used for vitamins, while pathological ranges are used for hormones.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard (pathological) ranges are based on a bell curve of the 'sick' population to identify disease states, while functional ranges target the narrow window where the body operates at its best."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A client's TSH is 3.8 uIU/mL. While the lab marks this as 'Normal' (range 0.45–4.5), the Specialist identifies it as subclinical based on the functional range of:",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 1.0 uIU/mL",
                "1.0 - 2.5 uIU/mL",

                "0.5 - 5.5 uIU/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine, the optimal (functional) range for TSH is typically 1.0 to 2.0 or 2.5 uIU/mL. A level of 3.8 often indicates subclinical thyroid dysfunction."

            "question": "During the 'Synthesizing the Discovery' phase (Lesson 8), what is the main goal of creating a 'Root Cause Map'?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a definitive medical diagnosis for the client's insurance company.",
                "To visualize the connections between different drivers (e.g., gut health, stress, and metabolism) to prioritize interventions.",
                "To replace the need for any further laboratory testing.",
                "To prove to the client that their genetics are the only factor in their health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Root Cause Map allows the practitioner to see how seemingly unrelated symptoms and drivers intersect, helping to identify which 'lever' to pull first for the greatest impact."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Based on the NHANES data cited in Lesson 5, what percentage of the US adult population is considered 'metabolically healthy' (optimal levels of blood sugar, lipids, and blood pressure)?",
            "options": [
                "50%",
                "33.5%",

                "5.8%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (Araujo et al., 2019) using NHANES data found that only 12.2% of US adults are metabolically healthy, highlighting why blood sugar is a near-universal root driver."
