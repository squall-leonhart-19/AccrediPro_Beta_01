            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™ emphasizes that blood sugar stability and circadian alignment are foundational pillars that must be addressed before more aggressive or targeted interventions are implemented."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'wired but tired' state is a classic HPA-axis (Adrenal) dysfunction symptom, while mid-section weight gain and cystic acne (often driven by androgens) point to Insulin/Metabolic dysfunction."

            "question": "Regarding the Thyroid-Adrenal-Ovarian (TAO) Axis, how does chronic elevation of cortisol specifically impact thyroid hormone physiology?",

                "It increases the conversion of T4 to active T3",
                "It stimulates the pituitary to overproduce TSH",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into active T3, instead shunting T4 into the inactive form, Reverse T3."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High insulin levels suppress the liver's production of SHBG, which leads to higher levels of free (active) testosterone, contributing to the symptoms of PCOS and ovulatory inhibition."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-couples' estrogen from its conjugated state in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream."

                "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) increases by 5-10%",
                "The body prefers glucose over fats as a primary fuel source"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the luteal phase, the rise in progesterone increases the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by roughly 5-10%, necessitating an increase in caloric intake (approx. 200-300 calories) to maintain hormonal stability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cruciferous vegetables contain compounds that act similarly to Calcium D-Glucarate, which inhibits the beta-glucuronidase enzyme, allowing estrogen to be excreted rather than reabsorbed."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True autonomy and resilience occur when the client understands their own body's signals and can adjust their nutrition, movement, and workflow to align with their internal infradian rhythm."
