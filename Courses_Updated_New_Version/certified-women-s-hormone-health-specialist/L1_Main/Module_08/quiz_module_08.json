        {
            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1 (Root Cause Discovery), which endocrine marker is considered the earliest indicator of the perimenopausal transition, often declining before a significant rise in FSH is observed?",
            "options": ["Serum Progesterone", "Inhibin B", "Estrone (E1)", "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inhibin B, produced by the granulosa cells of the follicles, typically declines early in perimenopause. This decline reduces the negative feedback on the pituitary, eventually leading to the characteristic rise in FSH."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to the HPO-Axis Shift discussed in Lesson 2, what is the primary site of estrogen production once the ovaries have ceased follicular activity?",
            "options": ["The Anterior Pituitary", "The Corpus Luteum", "Peripheral tissues (adipose and muscle) via aromatization", "The Adrenal Medulla"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In post-menopause, the majority of circulating estrogen (primarily estrone) is derived from the peripheral aromatization of adrenal androgens (androstenedione) within adipose tissue and skeletal muscle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 highlights 'Metabolic Flexibility.' Which mechanism explains why declining estrogen levels in midlife often lead to increased visceral adiposity?",
            "options": ["Increased GLUT4 translocation efficiency", "Upregulation of lipoprotein lipase in gluteofemoral fat", "Downregulation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors", "Reduced estrogen signaling at the ESR1 receptor in the hypothalamus and adipose tissue"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Loss of estrogen signaling at the ESR1 receptor leads to decreased energy expenditure and a shift toward visceral fat storage, as estrogen normally helps regulate insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Regarding Therapeutic Micronutrition (Lesson 4), what is the specific role of Vitamin K2 (MK-7) in bone health for the post-menopausal client?",
            "options": ["It increases the intestinal absorption of calcium", "It activates osteocalcin, ensuring calcium is deposited in the bone matrix rather than arteries", "It inhibits the production of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)", "It stimulates the conversion of D2 to D3"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K2 is a cofactor for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, a protein that binds calcium to the bone hydroxyapatite matrix, preventing ectopic calcification in the vasculature."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Advanced Estrogen Metabolism,' which phase II detoxification pathway is critical for neutralizing reactive catechol estrogens (4-OH and 2-OH) to prevent DNA damage?",
            "options": ["Glucuronidation via UGT enzymes", "Sulfation via SULT1A1", "Methylation via COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase)", "Acetylation via NAT2"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "COMT is responsible for the methylation of catechol estrogens. If methylation is sluggish (due to genetic SNPs or nutrient deficiencies), these metabolites can oxidize into quinones, which are genotoxic."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A client presents with 'wired but tired' energy, high evening cortisol, and low Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Based on Lesson 6, which somatic regulation tool is most appropriate for restoring Vagal Tone?",
            "options": ["High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)", "Prolonged water fasting", "Extended Exhale Breathing (e.g., 4-7-8 technique)", "Caffeine-induced thermogenesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extended exhales stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve, helping to shift the client out of a sympathetic-dominant 'fight or flight' state and improve HRV."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Post-Menopausal Vitality.' What is the 'Estrobolome,' and why does it matter in the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework?",
            "options": ["A specific set of genes located on the X chromosome", "The collection of enteric bacteria capable of metabolizing and recirculating estrogens", "The measurement of estrogen receptors in the brain", "A synthetic form of estrogen used in HRT"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome is the aggregate of enteric bacteria with the ability to produce beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that deconjugates estrogens, allowing them to be reabsorbed into circulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Masterclass (Lesson 8), when a practitioner addresses 'O' (Optimal Detoxification), which clinical sign suggests Phase 3 detox (elimination) is the priority?",
            "options": ["Elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT)", "Chronic constipation and low fiber intake", "Slow COMT genetic profile", "High levels of 16-OH estrogen"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 3 detoxification refers to the excretion of neutralized toxins via the bile and stool. Chronic constipation allows for the reabsorption of toxins/hormones, making regular bowel movements the foundation of 'Optimal Detoxification.' "

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Clinical Application: A 52-year-old client reports brain fog, night sweats, and a 15lb weight gain around the midsection despite no change in diet. Her fasting insulin is 14 μIU/mL. Which 'R.E.S.T.O.R.E.' pillar should be prioritized first?",
            "options": ["T - Therapeutic Micronutrition (Bone health focus)", "S - Somatic Regulation (Yoga only)", "S - Insulin Sensitivity & Metabolic Flexibility", "E - Endocrine Synergy (Adding high-dose DHEA)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A fasting insulin of 14 μIU/mL indicates insulin resistance (optimal is typically <5-7). Addressing metabolic flexibility (S) is crucial to resolve the weight gain and brain fog associated with glucose instability in menopause."

        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "According to the data presented in the module, the risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) increases significantly post-menopause. This is largely attributed to the loss of estrogen's effect on:",
            "options": ["Decreasing Nitric Oxide production in the endothelium", "Increasing LDL particle size and reducing HDL-c", "Maintaining vascular elasticity and favorable lipid profiles", "Stimulating the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is cardioprotective because it promotes vasodilation (via nitric oxide), maintains arterial elasticity, and helps maintain higher HDL levels while keeping LDL and triglycerides lower."
