            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "According to the Rotterdam Criteria, which PCOS phenotype is considered the most 'classic' and severe, involving hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries?",
            "options": [
                "Phenotype A",
                "Phenotype B",
                "Phenotype C",
                "Phenotype D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phenotype A (Full PCOS) includes all three criteria: Hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), Ovulatory Dysfunction, and Polycystic Ovarian Morphology (PCOM), and is associated with the highest risk of metabolic syndrome."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the pathophysiology of Endometriosis, what is the primary consequence of 'progesterone resistance' within ectopic lesions?",
            "options": [
                "Increased conversion of estrogen to testosterone",
                "Inability to downregulate estrogen receptors and stop lesion proliferation",
                "Rapid depletion of the ovarian reserve",
                "Suppression of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone resistance prevents the normal 'braking' mechanism of progesterone on estrogen-driven growth, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of endometrial-like tissue and chronic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "During the 'Second Adolescence' (Perimenopause), what hormonal shift is most responsible for the characteristic erratic cycles and heavy bleeding?",
            "options": [
                "A steady, linear decline in estrogen over 10 years",
                "The complete cessation of LH production",
                "Erratic FSH spikes leading to 'luteal out-of-phase' (LOOP) events and estrogen surges",
                "A sudden increase in SHBG that binds all available progesterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perimenopause is characterized by erratic FSH elevations as the brain attempts to stimulate remaining follicles, often resulting in high estrogen 'surges' followed by cycles where ovulation does not occur (low progesterone)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is differentiated from standard PMS primarily by:",
            "options": [
                "Significantly higher absolute levels of serum progesterone",
                "A total lack of estrogen production in the luteal phase",
                "An abnormal GABAergic receptor sensitivity to the neurosteroid allopregnanolone",
                "High levels of testosterone causing irritability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PMDD is not a hormone deficiency; it is a neurobiological sensitivity where the brain's GABA receptors react paradoxically or maladaptively to the fluctuations of the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Research indicates that Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (HA) typically occurs when Energy Availability (EA) falls below which threshold?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg of fat-free mass (FFM)",
                "30 kcal/kg of fat-free mass (FFM)",
                "20 kcal/kg of fat-free mass (FFM)",
                "10 kcal/kg of fat-free mass (FFM)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "30 kcal/kg of FFM is widely recognized as the 'danger zone' where the hypothalamus begins to downregulate the HPG axis to conserve energy for vital survival functions."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Which condition is characterized by the presence of endometrial stroma and glands specifically within the myometrium (muscular wall) of the uterus?",
            "options": [
                "Uterine Fibroids",
                "Adenomyosis",
                "PCOS Phenotype D",
                "Endometrial Hyperplasia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adenomyosis is often called 'endometriosis of the uterus' because it involves the infiltration of endometrial tissue into the muscular uterine wall, causing a 'boggy' and enlarged uterus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In the 'Thyroid-Ovarian Interplay,' how does subclinical hypothyroidism typically impact fertility even if the client is still ovulating?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the rate of follicle depletion",
                "By elevating prolactin and interfering with corpus luteum function",
                "By causing the fallopian tubes to constrict",
                "By increasing the pH of the vaginal canal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypothyroidism can increase Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH), which stimulates prolactin. Elevated prolactin can disrupt the LH/FSH balance and weaken progesterone production from the corpus luteum."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Environmental 'Xenoestrogens' like Phthalates and BPA disrupt the endocrine system by:",
            "options": [
                "Binding to estrogen receptors and inducing 'estrogenic' signaling or blocking natural estrogen",
                "Converting all cholesterol into cortisol",
                "Increasing the excretion of progesterone via the kidneys",
                "Destroying the thyroid gland's ability to uptake iodine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that mimic the shape of 17β-estradiol, allowing them to bind to ERα and ERβ receptors, often leading to 'estrogen dominance' symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client with HA is attempting recovery. Which of the following is the most critical physiological signal required to restart GnRH pulsatility?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in total caloric intake",
                "An increase in leptin levels signaling sufficient energy stores",
                "A significant increase in high-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "The use of synthetic progestins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin, produced by adipose tissue, acts as a metabolic gatekeeper. When leptin levels are too low (due to low body fat or under-eating), the hypothalamus remains in a state of 'famine' and suppresses the reproductive axis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which metabolic marker is the most sensitive for identifying the underlying driver of 'Metabolic PCOS' (Phenotypes A & B)?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "HOMA-IR (Fasting Insulin x Fasting Glucose / 22.5)",
                "Serum Progesterone on Day 21",
                "Urinary Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR is a gold-standard assessment for insulin resistance, which is the primary driver of androgen excess in the majority of PCOS cases by stimulating the ovarian theca cells to produce testosterone."
