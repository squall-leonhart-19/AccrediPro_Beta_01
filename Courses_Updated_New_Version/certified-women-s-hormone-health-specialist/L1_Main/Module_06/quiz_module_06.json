            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "The 'top-down' approach in the RESTORE protocol posits that hormone balance is secondary to nervous system regulation because:",
            "options": [
                "The hypothalamus must perceive safety to prioritize the HPO axis over the HPA axis.",
                "Hormones are only produced when the sympathetic nervous system is fully activated.",
                "The liver cannot detoxify estrogen without high levels of adrenaline.",
                "The ovaries operate independently of the central nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The hypothalamus integrates neural signals and determines whether to prioritize survival (HPA axis) or reproduction (HPO axis). Without a perception of safety (nervous system regulation), the body downregulates reproductive hormone production."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Chronic sympathetic dominance affects the menstrual cycle primarily by which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the frequency of GnRH pulses to dangerous levels.",
                "Inhibiting GnRH pulsatility, leading to suppressed LH and FSH production.",
                "Directly stimulating the corpus luteum to overproduce progesterone.",
                "Lowering blood glucose so significantly that ovulation is triggered early."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of stress signaling (CRH and Cortisol) inhibit the pulsatile release of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH), which is required for the proper secretion of LH and FSH, often leading to delayed ovulation or amenorrhea."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Regarding the 'Pregnenolone Steal' theory, what does current research suggest is the actual cause of low progesterone during stress?",
            "options": [
                "A physical shortage of pregnenolone substrate in the mitochondria.",
                "The adrenal glands 'robbing' progesterone from the ovaries via the bloodstream.",
                "Selective HPA axis signaling that prioritizes cortisol synthesis over HPO axis activation.",
                "A total depletion of cholesterol in the body."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' is largely a myth of substrate competition; in reality, the body has enough substrate, but the brain signals the HPA axis to take priority, while enzymes for sex hormone production are downregulated."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a Heart Rate Variability (HRV) score that has dropped from a baseline of 60ms to 25ms over two weeks. This most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "An improvement in cardiovascular fitness and aerobic capacity.",
                "A shift toward parasympathetic dominance and better recovery.",
                "Increased allostatic load and a reduced capacity for the nervous system to adapt to stress.",
                "That the client's wearable device is malfunctioning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in HRV indicates a loss of vagal tone and a shift toward sympathetic dominance, suggesting the client is struggling to recover from current stressors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the oldest evolutionary response to extreme threat, manifesting as shutdown, dissociation, and a 'freeze' response."

            "options": [
                "Viewing 10-30 minutes of bright, outdoor light within 30-60 minutes of waking.",
                "Wearing blue-light blocking glasses from the moment of waking until noon.",
                "Staying in a dark room for at least 3 hours after waking.",
                "Avoiding all sunlight until the late afternoon to prevent cortisol spikes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Early morning light exposure triggers the CAR, which sets a timer for melatonin production 12-14 hours later and regulates the master clock in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show that even partial sleep deprivation significantly elevates evening cortisol levels the following day, disrupting the natural diurnal rhythm and metabolic health."

            "question": "Which of the following is a 'bottom-up' somatic regulation technique specifically mentioned for stimulating the vagus nerve?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vocal toning, humming, and gargling are 'bottom-up' techniques that physically stimulate the vagus nerve via its branches in the throat and ear."

            "question": "In the context of 'The Psychological Load,' why are boundaries considered a hormonal health intervention?",
            "options": [
                "They increase estrogen levels in the follicular phase.",
                "They reduce chronic allostatic load, preventing constant HPA axis activation.",
                "They prevent the 'theft' of progesterone by other people.",
                "They have no physiological effect but help with scheduling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Poor boundaries lead to chronic psychosocial stress, which keeps the HPA axis in a state of constant activation, leading to high cortisol and subsequent sex hormone imbalances."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "When integrating regulation into the RESTORE protocol, if a client is in a 'Burnout' (low cortisol/low HRV) phase, what type of movement is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) to 'jumpstart' the system.",

                "Long-distance marathon training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a state of burnout or low adaptive capacity, high-intensity exercise acts as an additional stressor that the body cannot recover from. Restorative movement supports the parasympathetic nervous system without adding significant allostatic load."
