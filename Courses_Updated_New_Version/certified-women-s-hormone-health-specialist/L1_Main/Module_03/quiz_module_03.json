            "question": "According to the Metabolic-Hormonal Axis hierarchy, why does the body prioritize blood sugar regulation over reproductive hormone production?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone is required for glucose transport into the brain",
                "Maintaining blood glucose within a narrow range (70-100 mg/dL) is critical for immediate CNS survival and ATP production",
                "Insulin is a steroid hormone that competes for the same receptors as estrogen",
                "The ovaries are the primary site of glucose storage in the female body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The body views blood sugar stability as a survival priority. If glucose is unstable, the HPA axis is activated to release cortisol, which often leads to the 'downregulation' of the HPO (reproductive) axis to conserve energy."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "During the mid-to-late luteal phase, how does the Infradian rhythm typically affect a woman's glycemic variability?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin sensitivity increases, requiring higher carbohydrate intake to prevent hypoglycemia",
                "Progesterone increases insulin sensitivity, making it easier to maintain low blood sugar",
                "Progesterone induces a state of relative insulin resistance, often resulting in higher fasting glucose and increased cravings",
                "Estrogen peaks cause the pancreas to stop secreting insulin entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the luteal phase, higher progesterone levels naturally decrease insulin sensitivity. This is an evolutionary mechanism to ensure the body has enough glucose available for a potential pregnancy, but it results in higher glycemic variability for the modern woman."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'normal' HbA1c of 5.3% but a Fasting Insulin of 14 uIU/mL. What does this suggest about her metabolic stability?",
            "options": [
                "She is metabolically healthy because her HbA1c is below 5.7%",
                "She is in a state of 'Hyperinsulinemic Normoglycemia,' meaning her body is overworking to keep blood sugar normal",
                "She has Type 1 Diabetes and requires immediate insulin injections",
                "Her insulin is too low and she needs to increase her sugar intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HbA1c is a 3-month average and can remain normal even when insulin is pathologically high. A fasting insulin above 5-7 uIU/mL often indicates early-stage insulin resistance that HbA1c fails to capture."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "What are the two primary mechanisms by which hyperinsulinemia drives the high androgen levels seen in PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulating ovarian theca cells to produce testosterone and inhibiting the liver's production of SHBG",
                "Increasing estrogen conversion in adipose tissue and decreasing cortisol",
                "Blocking the LH surge and increasing progesterone receptors",
                "Destroying the adrenal glands and increasing DHEA-S"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH to stimulate theca cells to produce androgens. Simultaneously, it suppresses Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) in the liver, leading to higher levels of 'free' (active) testosterone."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "In the 'Nutritive Strategies for Glucose Blunting' lesson, what is the recommended sequence of food consumption to reduce a postprandial glucose spike by up to 75%?",
            "options": [
                "Starches first, then fats, then fiber, then protein",
                "Protein first, then starches, then fiber, then fats",
                "Fiber (vegetables) first, followed by proteins and fats, with starches/sugars last",
                "Fruit first on an empty stomach, followed by complex carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consuming fiber first creates a viscous mesh in the small intestine that slows the absorption of glucose. Following with protein/fats further slows gastric emptying before starches hit the bloodstream."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which micronutrient ratio has been shown in clinical trials to be most effective for restoring ovulation and improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "A 10:1 ratio of Magnesium to Calcium",
                "A 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol",
                "A 1:1 ratio of Zinc to Copper",
                "A 5:1 ratio of Vitamin D3 to Vitamin K2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol mimics the physiological ratio found in plasma and is the gold standard for improving metabolic and ovulatory outcomes in PCOS."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Skeletal muscle is often referred to as a 'glucose sink.' Approximately what percentage of postprandial glucose is cleared by skeletal muscle via GLUT4 translocation?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "40-50%",
                "70-80%",
                "95-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Skeletal muscle is the primary site for glucose disposal. Roughly 80% of glucose cleared from the blood after a meal is taken up by muscle tissue, making muscle mass a critical 'metabolic insurance policy.'"

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Why does the Metabolic Stabilization Protocol advise against consuming high-carbohydrate meals late at night, specifically in relation to Melatonin?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin makes the stomach digest food too quickly",
                "Melatonin binds to insulin receptors and blocks glucose uptake",
                "High melatonin levels inhibit the secretion of insulin from the pancreas, leading to prolonged nocturnal hyperglycemia",
                "Melatonin causes the liver to dump stored glycogen into the blood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "There is a 'dark-phase' insulin inhibition. When melatonin is high (at night), the pancreas is less responsive. Eating late at night when melatonin is rising leads to higher and longer blood sugar spikes."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Using the HOMA-IR calculation (Glucose [mg/dL] x Insulin [uIU/mL] / 405), what is the score for a client with a fasting glucose of 95 and fasting insulin of 12?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 (Optimal)",
                "2.1 (Moderate Resistance)",
                "2.8 (Significant Insulin Resistance)",
                "4.2 (Severe Type 2 Diabetes)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "(95 x 12) / 405 = 2.81. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, and above 2.5 indicates significant insulin resistance, even if glucose is within the 'normal' lab range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'hangry' episodes at 11:00 AM every day. Based on the Metabolic Stabilization Protocol, what is the first clinical intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Increase caffeine intake to suppress appetite",
                "Transition to a 'Protein Forward' breakfast with at least 30-40g of protein and minimal refined starch",
                "Recommend 16:8 intermittent fasting to 'reset' the pancreas",
                "Suggest a high-sugar snack at 10:30 AM to prevent the drop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Protein Forward' breakfast is the anchor of metabolic stability. It prevents the mid-morning hypoglycemic crash caused by a high-carb breakfast and sets the glycemic tone for the rest of the day."
