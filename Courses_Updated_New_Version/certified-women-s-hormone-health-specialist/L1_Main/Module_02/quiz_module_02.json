            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "In the Ovarian-Adrenal-Thyroid (OAT) Axis, how does chronic adrenal activation primarily impact thyroid function at the cellular level?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the pituitary to overproduce TSH",
                "It inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3 and increases Reverse T3",
                "It increases the sensitivity of thyroid hormone receptors",
                "It causes an autoimmune response against thyroid peroxidase (TPO)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol levels inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into the active T3, while simultaneously shunting T4 toward the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Neural Command' feedback loops (L2), which mechanism is responsible for the mid-cycle LH surge required for ovulation?",
            "options": [
                "Negative feedback from high Progesterone levels",
                "Positive feedback from Estrogen reaching a specific threshold for ~48 hours",
                "The suppression of GnRH by the hypothalamus",
                "A sudden drop in Inhibin B from the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The LH surge is a unique example of positive feedback where sustained high levels of estrogen signal the pituitary to release a massive amount of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) to trigger ovulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (L3) describes a phenomenon where the body prioritizes the production of which hormone over Progesterone during chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "DHEA",
                "Aldosterone",
                "Cortisol",
                "Androstenedione"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because survival (cortisol) takes precedence over reproduction (progesterone), the body shunts the precursor pregnenolone toward the adrenal pathway to produce cortisol, often leading to a luteal phase progesterone deficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Clinically, hypothyroidism is most frequently associated with which menstrual cycle dynamic (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "Shortened cycles with very light flow",
                "Amenorrhea (absence of periods) exclusively",
                "Menorrhagia (heavy/prolonged bleeding) due to impaired coagulation and poor corpus luteum function",
                "Precocious ovulation (ovulating too early in the cycle)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypothyroidism often leads to heavier menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) because low thyroid levels can decrease coagulation factors and result in a weak corpus luteum that produces insufficient progesterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "How does excess Estrogen (Estrogen Dominance) impact the availability of thyroid hormones (L5)?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), leading to hyperthyroidism",
                "It increases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), which 'binds up' free T4 and T3",
                "It directly destroys T3 molecules in the bloodstream",
                "It has no measurable impact on thyroid binding proteins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High estrogen levels (from HRT, the pill, or endogenous dominance) stimulate the liver to produce more TBG. This increases the 'bound' (inactive) fraction of thyroid hormones, potentially causing symptoms of hypothyroidism even if TSH appears normal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In the context of the Metabolic Crossroads (L6), what is the primary effect of hyperinsulinemia on Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin increases SHBG, leading to low libido",
                "Insulin suppresses hepatic production of SHBG, increasing levels of 'free' bioactive testosterone",
                "Insulin converts SHBG into cortisol",
                "Insulin has no effect on SHBG; it only affects glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High insulin levels signal the liver to decrease SHBG production. Lower SHBG means more testosterone is 'free' or unbound, which is a hallmark of the hormonal profile seen in PCOS and metabolic OAT axis dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A client presents with fatigue, cold intolerance, and heavy periods. Her labs show TSH of 3.8 mIU/L (suboptimal) and low Luteal Progesterone. Which OAT axis pattern is most likely (L7)?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Ovarian Failure",
                "Thyroid-led Synergy Imbalance",
                "Adrenal-only Hypercortisolemia",
                "Insulin-driven Androgen Excess"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This pattern suggests a Thyroid-led imbalance where the sluggish thyroid function is the primary driver affecting the quality of the menstrual cycle and progesterone production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Within the RESTORE Synergy Evaluation Framework (L8), what does the 'S' represent?",
            "options": [
                "Symptom Suppression",
                "Synergy Mapping",
                "Standard Deviation",
                "Serum Sampling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' in RESTORE stands for Synergy Mapping, which involves plotting the interconnectedness of the Ovarian, Adrenal, and Thyroid symptoms to find the 'root' driver."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which of the following statistics regarding the OAT axis was highlighted in Module 2?",
            "options": [
                "90% of women with PCOS also have Addison's disease",
                "Roughly 25-40% of women with hypothyroidism also experience menstrual irregularities",
                "Stress increases progesterone production by 500%",
                "Insulin resistance only affects women over the age of 60"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a significant percentage (25-40%) of women with thyroid dysfunction experience measurable changes in their menstrual cycle length or flow volume."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When evaluating a client's OAT axis synergy, why is it critical to assess the Adrenals before aggressively treating the Thyroid with T3-only medication?",
            "options": [
                "T3 will cause the adrenals to shut down permanently",
                "Increased metabolic rate from T3 without adrenal support can trigger an 'adrenal crash' or severe anxiety",
                "Adrenals produce T3, so thyroid medication is redundant",
                "The adrenals must be 'cleansed' for 6 months before any thyroid intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormones increase the metabolic clearance of cortisol. If a client has low adrenal reserve, introducing T3 can deplete remaining cortisol too quickly, leading to an adrenal crisis or significant symptom exacerbation."
