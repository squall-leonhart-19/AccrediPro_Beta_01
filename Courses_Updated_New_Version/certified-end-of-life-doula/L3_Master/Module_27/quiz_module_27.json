            "question": "In pediatric end-of-life support, how do children in the 'pre-operational' stage (typically ages 2–7) generally perceive death?",
            "options": [
                "As a permanent and universal biological process.",
                "As a temporary, reversible state or similar to sleep.",
                "As a spiritual transition involving an afterlife.",
                "As a purely abstract concept with no personal relevance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to Piaget's stages of development, children in the pre-operational stage often engage in 'magical thinking' and may view death as reversible, temporary, or like sleep, rather than a final biological event."

                "To acknowledge the emotional truth behind the client's statements rather than the factual accuracy.",
                "To force the client to remember the names of all family members present."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validation Therapy (developed by Naomi Feil) focuses on the empathy and the emotional reality of the person with dementia, rather than trying to force them into a 'current reality' they can no longer access."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In jurisdictions where Medical Aid in Dying (MAiD) is legal, which of the following actions is strictly prohibited for an End-of-Life Doula?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MAiD laws require the patient to be capable of self-administration. A Doula (or any other person) physically administering the medication would constitute euthanasia or homicide, which is illegal in the United States."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike MAiD, which requires a terminal diagnosis and specific legal protocols, VSED is a right to refuse treatment/sustenance that can be chosen by individuals who are not yet within the 6-month terminal window, provided they have mental capacity."
