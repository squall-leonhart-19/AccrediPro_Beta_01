            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At the Master Integration level, advocacy is about maintaining the client's autonomy and ensuring their documented wishes guide all clinical decisions, acting as a bridge between the family and the institution."

            "question": "During advanced conflict resolution (Lesson 2), a Doula identifies 'Triangulation' occurring between two siblings and a hospice nurse. What is the most effective master-level intervention?",

                "Removing the siblings from the room permanently",
                "Facilitating direct communication between the siblings to dissolve the 'triangle' and reduce tension",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master-level conflict resolution involves identifying dysfunctional communication patterns like triangulation and gently guiding parties back to direct, honest dialogue to lower the collective anxiety of the system."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "When performing a 'Nuanced Spiritual Assessment' (Lesson 3), what does the presence of 'Spiritual Bypass' in a client or family member typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A complete lack of religious belief or interest",

                "The clinical phase where a patient no longer wishes to speak with a chaplain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual Bypass is a defense mechanism where individuals use 'spiritual' explanations to suppress the raw, difficult emotions of the dying process. A Master Doula recognizes this and provides space for deeper emotional processing."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Ethical Narrative Preservation' emphasizes 'Narrative Sovereignty.' Why is this concept critical in legacy work?",

                "It mandates that the family has the final say on how the client's life is portrayed",
                "It protects the client's right to be the sole authority over the meaning and 'truth' of their own life story",
                "It refers to the legal copyright of the legacy project materials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative Sovereignty ensures that the legacy work reflects the client's authentic voice and choices, rather than being shaped by the family's desires or the Doula's personal interpretations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master-level vigil management involves the precise control of the environment (lighting, sound, scent) to match the client's neurological state, specifically reducing overstimulation during terminal restlessness."

                "To wait for the legal pronouncement of death by a physician",

                "To finalize the Doula's billing and administrative paperwork"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Hour' is a sacred, intentional pause that prevents the 'rush' to remove the body, allowing the family to honor the transition and begin their grief journey in a peaceful, unhurried environment."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "Regarding 'Professional Longevity' (Lesson 8), research suggests that Doulas who maintain a high 'Compassion Satisfaction' score are less likely to burn out. What contributes most to this satisfaction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional longevity is sustained through 'Compassion Satisfaction,' which is bolstered by community support (supervision), healthy boundaries, and recognizing the positive impact of one's work."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "A client exhibits 'Cheyne-Stokes' respirations during the vigil. As a Master Doula, how do you explain this to the family?",
            "options": [
                "It is a sign of acute pain that requires immediate medication",
                "It is a normal, rhythmic pattern of breathing (periods of apnea followed by hyperpnea) often seen in the final hours",
                "It indicates the client is choking and needs suctioning",
                "It is a sign that the client is waking up and becoming more alert"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Education is a key part of master integration. Explaining the physiological reality of Cheyne-Stokes breathing reduces family anxiety and prevents unnecessary 'emergency' interventions during a natural process."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'The Business of Mastery' (Lesson 8), why is 'Income Diversification' recommended for a sustainable Doula practice?",
            "options": [
                "Because direct end-of-life care is emotionally intensive and can lead to burnout if it is the only revenue stream",
                "To avoid paying taxes on a single source of income",
                "Because being a Doula is not a 'real' profession and requires a second job",
                "To ensure the Doula can charge higher rates for bedside care"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Income diversification (e.g., teaching, consulting, speaking) provides financial stability and emotional 'breathing room,' allowing the Doula to be fully present for direct care without the pressure of needing to be at the bedside 24/7 for survival."
