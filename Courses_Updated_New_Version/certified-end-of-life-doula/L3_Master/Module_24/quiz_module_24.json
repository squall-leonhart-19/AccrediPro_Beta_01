            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 practitioners utilize 'somatic neutrality,' acting as a regulated 'limbic anchor' that helps stabilize the high-arousal environment of a dying room through their own physiological calm."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environmental Psychophysics suggests that dying individuals become hypersensitive to sensory input; reducing 'sensory clutter' like sharp shadows and high-frequency noise helps mitigate agitation."
