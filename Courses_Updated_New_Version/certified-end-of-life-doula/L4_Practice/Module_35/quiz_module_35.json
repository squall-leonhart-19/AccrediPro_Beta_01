            "question": "When transitioning from a solo practitioner to an agency founder (L1), what is the 'Founder's Trap' that most frequently inhibits growth?",
            "options": [
                "Setting the service prices too high for the local market",
                "Remaining the primary point of contact for all clinical client cases",
                "Hiring too many administrative staff before hiring doulas",
                "Investing in high-end office space prematurely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Founder's Trap' occurs when the business cannot function without the founder's direct involvement in service delivery. Scaling requires the founder to shift from 'Doing' to 'Leading' and delegating clinical care to a team."

                "The collective operates as a single 501(c)(3) to eliminate liability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A collective is typically an association of independent business owners who share resources (like marketing or space) but remain legally and financially distinct entities responsible for their own insurance and taxes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hospices are often overwhelmed by 'anxiety calls' after hours. Doulas provide a non-medical presence that stabilizes the family, significantly reducing the burden on the hospice's on-call clinical staff."

                "To track the physical GPS location of potential clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Retargeting pixels allow agencies to serve ads specifically to people who have already shown interest by visiting the site, which is crucial in death care where the 'buying cycle' may be based on a sudden change in a loved one's health."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High operating leverage exists when you can increase output (revenue) without a proportional increase in input (time/labor). A pre-recorded course costs the same to deliver to 5 people as it does to 500."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a service-based agency to cover overhead, marketing, and founder salary while remaining sustainable, a gross margin of 40-60% (the difference between what the client pays and what the doula is paid) is the industry standard."
