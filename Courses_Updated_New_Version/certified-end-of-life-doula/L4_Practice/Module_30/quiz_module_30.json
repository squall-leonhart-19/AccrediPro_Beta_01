                "It permits the doula to give medical advice if they have a prior nursing background",
                "It clearly defines the boundaries of the doula's role and protects against the unauthorized practice of medicine",
                "It is a requirement for obtaining a business license in all 50 states"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Non-Medical Disclosure is a critical boundary-setting tool that ensures the client and family understand the doula provides emotional, physical, and spiritual support, not clinical or medical intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Death-positive branding seeks to reduce the stigma surrounding mortality by using transparent, dignified, and compassionate language that invites open conversation about end-of-life care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hospice teams are often stretched thin; a doula's value lies in their ability to provide the consistent, 'gap-filling' emotional and physical presence that clinical teams are logistically unable to offer."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas must never administer medication. This is a strict ethical and legal boundary that distinguishes non-medical support from clinical nursing or medical care."
