            "question": "An End-of-Life Doula is asked by a family member to increase the dosage of a client's patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Which action best aligns with the Doula's Scope of Practice?",
            "options": [
                "Adjust the pump as requested to ensure the client is comfortable.",
                "Decline and explain that doulas do not perform clinical or medical tasks, then notify the nursing staff.",
                "Adjust the pump only if the family member provides written permission.",
                "Check the client's vitals first to ensure it is safe to increase the dosage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The non-medical boundary is the most critical aspect of a doula's scope. Doulas never administer medication or adjust medical equipment, as these are clinical tasks reserved for licensed medical professionals."

            "question": "What is the primary legal distinction between a Living Will and a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)?",
            "options": [
                "A Living Will is a medical order, while a POLST is a personal statement.",
                "A POLST is only for healthy individuals, while a Living Will is for the terminally ill.",
                "A Living Will expresses future wishes, while a POLST is an actionable medical order for current treatment.",
                "There is no legal distinction; the terms are used interchangeably across all states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Living Will is a legal document that guides future care if a person becomes incapacitated. A POLST (or MOLST) is a set of specific medical orders signed by a clinician that must be followed by emergency personnel in the present moment."

                "Professional service agreements usually include confidentiality clauses that create a contractual obligation.",
                "Doulas are legally considered 'Business Associates' of every client they serve.",
                "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) audits all end-of-life practitioners annually.",
                "Confidentiality is only necessary if the doula is working in a hospital setting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Even if not technically a 'Covered Entity' under HIPAA, doulas have a professional and contractual duty to protect client privacy. Failure to do so can lead to breach of contract lawsuits and loss of professional reputation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In all U.S. jurisdictions where MAiD is legal, the patient must self-administer the medication. A doula (or any other person) mixing or administering the drug could be charged with assisted suicide or homicide."

                "It allows the doula to perform medical tasks without a license.",
                "It transfers the doula's legal responsibilities to the client's family."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Limitation of Liability clause is a risk management tool that limits the doula's financial exposure in the event of a dispute or unintentional error, typically capping it at the total cost of the services provided."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pronouncement and certification of death are clinical and legal acts. Doulas cannot legally pronounce death or sign death certificates; these tasks must be performed by authorized medical or legal officials."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires transparency in fees and the avoidance of conflicts of interest. Accepting kickbacks or borrowing money from clients creates significant legal and ethical vulnerabilities."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VSED is legally supported by the constitutional right to refuse unwanted medical intervention (including artificial nutrition and hydration). Unlike MAiD, it does not require a specific state 'Death with Dignity' law to be practiced."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doulas support the client's autonomy. By pointing to the legally binding 'Disposition of Remains' document, the doula helps ensure the client's wishes are honored while staying within their non-legal, supportive role."
