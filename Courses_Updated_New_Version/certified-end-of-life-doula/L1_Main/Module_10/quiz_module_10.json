            "options": [
                "Doulas may administer oral medications if the family is overwhelmed.",
                "Doulas provide non-medical, holistic support and must never perform clinical tasks like wound care or medication administration.",
                "Doulas can offer medical advice as long as it aligns with the hospice nurse's plan.",
                "Doulas are permitted to adjust oxygen flow rates if the patient is experiencing dyspnea."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The EOL Doula role is strictly non-medical. Performing clinical tasks or giving medical advice violates the scope of practice and professional liability standards."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supportive presence is about creating a safe, non-judgmental environment where the dying person and their family feel seen and heard during their unique experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chochinov's Dignity Therapy focuses on the patient's sense of self and the legacy they wish to leave behind, rather than logistical or financial planning."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Healthcare Proxy (or Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare) names a surrogate, while the Living Will specifies the types of medical care the patient does or does not want."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cheyne-Stokes is a common and normal breathing pattern at the end of life; educating the family helps reduce their anxiety about the patient's perceived comfort."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doulas model behavior. Encouraging the family that hearing is often the last sense to go helps maintain the connection between the family and the patient."
