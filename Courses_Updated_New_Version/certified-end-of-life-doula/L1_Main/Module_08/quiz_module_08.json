            "question": "During the 'Active Dying' phase, a client exhibits Cheyne-Stokes respiration. Which description best characterizes this physiological pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, shallow breathing followed by deep, gasping breaths with no pauses.",
                "Cycles of deep, rapid breathing followed by a period of total apnea.",
                "Consistently slow, labored breathing with a distinct rattling sound in the chest.",
                "Short, panting breaths that indicate acute respiratory distress and physical pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a common physiological sign of the final transition, characterized by a rhythmic crescendo-decrescendo pattern of breathing followed by periods of apnea (no breathing)."

            "question": "When managing sensory comfort during a vigil, why is the 'olfactory' environment considered particularly critical for the dying person?",
            "options": [
                "The sense of smell is the first to fade, requiring stronger scents to be effective.",
                "Olfactory signals bypass the thalamus and go directly to the limbic system, triggering deep emotional memories.",
                "Artificial scents are required to mask the 'smell of death' to prevent family trauma.",
                "Strong scents like peppermint are clinically proven to increase blood oxygen saturation in the final hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The olfactory system has a direct connection to the limbic system (the brain's emotional center), making scent a powerful tool for grounding or triggering peaceful memories, but also a risk for agitation if scents are too strong."

            "question": "A Doula is facilitating the 'Golden Hour' immediately following a client's death. What is the primary objective of this specific timeframe?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately call the funeral home to ensure the body is removed before rigor mortis sets in.",
                "To perform clinical checks to verify the exact minute of cardiac arrest.",
                "To preserve a period of stillness and transition, allowing the family to witness the 'presence of absence' without clinical interference.",
                "To begin the legal paperwork and insurance claims while the family is still present."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Hour' is a sacred window of time (usually 60-90 minutes) intended for silence, honor, and allowing the family to process the reality of the death before the logistical 'machinery' of post-mortem care begins."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "In the context of Post-Mortem Care, when does 'Rigor Mortis' typically peak, and how does this affect the Doula's timing for body positioning?",
            "options": [
                "It peaks at 2 hours; the body must be positioned immediately after the last breath.",
                "It peaks at 12 hours; the Doula should ensure the body is positioned (eyes closed, jaw supported) within the first 2-4 hours.",
                "It peaks at 24 hours; positioning is irrelevant as the funeral director will handle it.",
                "It peaks at 30 minutes; the Doula must act within seconds of death to prevent stiffness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rigor mortis (stiffening of the muscles) usually begins within 2-4 hours and peaks around 12 hours. Positioning the body (closing eyes, supporting the jaw) should happen early to ensure a peaceful appearance."

                "Anger-oriented and Acceptance-oriented",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model suggests that healthy grief involves moving back and forth between 'loss orientation' (crying, looking at photos) and 'restoration orientation' (dealing with finances, cooking, errands)."

                "Staying with the body ('watching') from the moment of death until burial to honor the soul.",
                "Opening all windows in the house to let the spirit fly out.",
                "Covering all mirrors in the home to prevent the soul from being trapped."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shemira is the act of 'guarding' or 'watching' the body (the deceased is called a Niftar) to show respect and ensure the body is never left alone before burial."

            "options": [
                "Increase the dose slightly, as Doulas are trained in comfort care.",
                "Refuse and explain that as a non-medical professional, you cannot adjust medication, then immediately contact the hospice nurse.",
                "Tell the family member how to do it themselves so you are not legally liable.",
                "Wait 30 minutes to see if the restlessness subsides before taking any action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doulas must maintain strict professional boundaries. Administering or adjusting medication is a medical task outside the Doula's scope of practice, regardless of the patient's apparent distress."

                "The legal timeframe in which a Doula must file their end-of-life reports."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is a psychological concept describing the state where a practitioner can function effectively and remain empathetic without being triggered into a 'fight/flight' or 'freeze' response."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which physiological sign is often considered the most reliable indicator that death will occur within minutes to hours (the 'terminal' phase)?",
            "options": [
                "The patient stops eating solid foods.",
                "The patient begins to experience 'terminal agitation' or restlessness.",

                "The patient sleeps for more than 20 hours a day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all are signs of decline, mottling (a purplish, blotchy discoloration caused by failing circulation) is a late-stage clinical indicator that the body is in the final hours of the transition."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Research on 'Auditory Awareness' in unresponsive end-of-life patients suggests that hearing is often the last sense to leave. What should the Doula advise the family based on this data?",
            "options": [
                "Speak only in whispers to avoid startling the patient.",
                "Continue to speak to the loved one as if they can hear, as EEG studies show the brain still processes verbal stimuli.",
                "Stop talking once the patient is unresponsive to conserve the patient's energy.",
                "Only play instrumental music, as words can be confusing to a dying brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice shows that even in an unresponsive state, the brain's auditory pathways often remain active. Doulas encourage families to share messages of love and permission, as the patient likely still perceives the sound."
