                "Administering PRN medications for pain and agitation.",
                "Providing non-medical, holistic support that complements clinical care.",
                "Adjusting oxygen flow rates based on respiratory distress.",
                "Prescribing herbal tinctures to replace pharmaceutical interventions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Doula's role is strictly non-medical and non-clinical, focusing on emotional, physical, and spiritual comfort that works alongside the medical team's treatment plan."

            "question": "A client in the active dying phase is experiencing 'terminal congestion' (death rattle). What is the most appropriate non-medical intervention for a Doula to suggest?",

                "Repositioning the client to a side-lying position (lateral recumbent).",
                "Encouraging the family to provide oral fluids to thin the mucus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Repositioning the client to their side allows gravity to help move secretions and often reduces the sound of the 'death rattle,' which is usually more distressing to the family than the patient."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During active dying, mouth breathing is common, leading to rapid drying. Frequent mouth care (every 15-30 minutes) using swabs or mist is a primary comfort measure."

                "Ensuring the volume of the music is at least 60 decibels to drown out clinical noises."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Iso-principle involves matching the music to the patient's current energy (e.g., agitated) and then gradually transitioning to a slower, calmer tempo to encourage relaxation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mottling is a natural part of the dying process caused by decreased peripheral circulation. It is generally not painful for the client but can be alarming to families if not explained."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Light stroking can sometimes be overstimulating or 'ticklish' to a dying person. Containment touch—simply placing a hand with steady, gentle pressure—is often more calming."
