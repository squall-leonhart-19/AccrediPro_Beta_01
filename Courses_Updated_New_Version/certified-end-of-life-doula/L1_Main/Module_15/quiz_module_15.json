            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The S.O.L.A.C.E. Method™ is designed to fill the 'non-medical gap' by providing continuous emotional, spiritual, and practical presence that clinical teams, due to caseloads, often cannot provide."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Holding space is the art of 'witnessing.' It requires the doula to set aside their own agenda and ego to be fully present for the client's unique experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
