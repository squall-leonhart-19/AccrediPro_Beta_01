            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mottling is caused by the slowing of peripheral circulation and typically manifests first on the dependent areas of the body, specifically the knees and the soles of the feet."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Terminal agitation is often exacerbated by sensory overload. A doula’s role is to manage the environment by reducing stimuli, offering gentle touch, and maintaining a calm, reassuring presence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
