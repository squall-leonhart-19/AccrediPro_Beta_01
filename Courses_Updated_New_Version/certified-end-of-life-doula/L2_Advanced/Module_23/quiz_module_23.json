                "The use of high-intensity clinical lighting to ensure safety.",
                "Consistent, low-level sensory inputs like a familiar scent or specific soft lighting.",
                "Changing the room layout daily to keep the patient stimulated.",
                "Maintaining total silence at all times to avoid overstimulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental anchors are consistent sensory cues that provide a sense of safety and familiarity, helping to ground a patient who may be experiencing disorientation or anxiety."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Somatic Presence' is discussed. What is the primary goal of 'Entrainment' when working with a non-verbal, actively dying client?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to breathe at a faster rate to increase oxygenation.",
                "To use physical therapy techniques to improve muscle tone.",
                "To subtly match the doula's breath and energy to the client's to create a sense of deep connection and calm.",
                "To distract the client from their physical pain through vigorous touch."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entrainment involves the doula synchronizing their own breathing and presence with the client's rhythm, which can non-verbally communicate safety and reduce the 'loneliness' of the dying process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a legal Will handles 'stuff,' an Ethical Will handles 'soul'—it is a modern legacy tool for sharing wisdom and intangible values."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is to be the 'voice of the patient's wishes,' using those wishes as the North Star to de-escalate conflict and refocus the family on the patient's needs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As the body shuts down, the senses can become hypersensitive; scents that were once comforting can become a source of distress or 'flooding' for the patient."

                "By teaching the family how to interpret complex EKG rhythms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monitor fatigue occurs when families focus on screens rather than their loved one. The doula helps shift the focus back to human connection and the patient's comfort."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas provide non-medical, non-judgmental support. They do not participate in the medical act but focus on the 'sacred space' and emotional container for the patient and family."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cooling the body is a practical technique used in home-based aftercare to preserve the body's appearance and allow the family a meaningful 'transition period' before the body is removed."
