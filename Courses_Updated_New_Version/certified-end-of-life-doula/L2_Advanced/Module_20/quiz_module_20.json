                "Legal documents and advanced directives",
                "Legacy and life review needs",

                "Linguistic preferences and communication barriers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the S.O.L.A.C.E. framework, 'L' stands for Legacy, focusing on the client's desire for life review, meaning-making, and the projects they wish to leave behind for loved ones."

            "question": "When assessing a non-verbal client for physical discomfort, which physiological indicator is most suggestive of 'terminal restlessness' rather than localized pain?",
            "options": [
                "Guarding a specific limb or area of the body",
                "Increased respiratory rate with rhythmic moaning",
                "Purposeless plucking at bed linens and emotional agitation",
                "Sudden diaphoresis (sweating) during repositioning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Terminal restlessness is characterized by cognitive impairment, agitation, and purposeless movements like plucking at linens (carphologia), whereas localized pain usually involves guarding or specific vocalizations during movement."

            "question": "The FICA Spiritual History Tool is a standard for EOL Doulas. If a client states, 'My faith helps me find peace, but I can't get to my church anymore,' which domain of FICA are they addressing?",
            "options": [
                "F - Faith and Belief",
                "I - Importance and Influence",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'C' in FICA stands for Community. This domain assesses whether the client is part of a spiritual or religious group and if that group provides support."

                "Increasing the room temperature to 75°F to improve circulation",
                "Applying heavy wool blankets to the lower limbs for warmth",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mottling is a sign of peripheral circulatory shutdown in active dying. Heavy blankets can feel oppressive to the dying person, and vigorous massage can be painful. A light sheet and gentle touch are preferred."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A 2021 study on caregiver burden found that 'anticipatory grief' is often mistaken for 'caregiver burnout.' Which assessment finding specifically indicates burnout according to the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)?",

                "Feelings of sadness regarding the client's decline",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Caregiver burnout (measured by the ZBI) is characterized by the erosion of the caregiver's own physical health, social life, and personal autonomy, whereas anticipatory grief focuses on the impending loss of the loved one."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective documentation focuses on observable, measurable facts (respiratory rate, audible sounds) rather than interpretations of emotion or subjective labels like 'angry' or 'not coping well.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cheyne-Stokes breathing is a rhythmic pattern of crescendo-decrescendo breathing followed by a period of apnea, common in the final hours or days of life."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "When evaluating 'Family Dynamics' (L6), the Doula identifies a 'Gatekeeper.' What is the primary risk associated with this role in a terminal care setting?",
            "options": [
                "The Gatekeeper will refuse to allow the Doula into the home",
                "Information is filtered or blocked, leading to family conflict and caregiver exhaustion",
                "The Gatekeeper will likely forget to administer medications",
                "There is no risk; a Gatekeeper is necessary for organized care"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Gatekeeper' controls the flow of information and access to the client. While they may feel they are protecting the client, this often leads to resentment from other family members and extreme fatigue for the Gatekeeper."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "An Environmental Audit (L5) reveals the client's room is 'cluttered with medical supplies and bright fluorescent lighting.' What is the Doula's priority assessment?",

                "The cost of the medical supplies",
                "The risk of the client falling while getting out of bed",

                "Whether the family has a proper disposal unit for biohazards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In an EOL context, the sensory audit prioritizes creating a 'sacred space.' Clutter and harsh lighting can increase agitation, confusion, and distress for the dying person, contributing to a clinical rather than peaceful atmosphere."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "According to the L2 lesson on Non-Medical Symptom Tracking, if a client scores a '7' on a 1-10 visual analog scale for 'Anxiety,' what is the Doula's first non-pharmacological step?",

                "Immediately call the hospice nurse to request Lorazepam",

                "Leave the room to give the client private space to calm down"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For high anxiety (7/10), a Doula utilizes non-medical interventions like guided imagery, breathwork, or touch, then re-assesses to determine if the intervention was effective or if medical escalation is needed."
