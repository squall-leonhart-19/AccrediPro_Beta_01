            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "In the context of high-conflict family dynamics, 'triangulation' occurs when a family member attempts to pull the doula into a conflict to take a side. What is the doula's most professional response?",
            "options": [
                "Agree with the family member who has the legal Power of Attorney to maintain order.",
                "Remain neutral and redirect the focus back to the client's expressed wishes and comfort.",
                "Provide a third-party opinion to settle the dispute based on personal experience.",
                "Withdraw from the case immediately to avoid professional liability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is to remain a neutral, non-anxious presence. By redirecting focus to the client's wishes, the doula avoids being 'triangulated' into family drama while upholding the client's autonomy."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Regarding Medical Aid in Dying (MAiD), which action is considered a strict boundary violation for an End-of-Life Doula?",
            "options": [
                "Discussing the client's fears regarding the MAiD timeline.",
                "Helping the family create a ritual for the final moments.",
                "Mixing or administering the lethal medication for the client.",
                "Providing emotional support to the family after the death has occurred."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A doula must never mix, handle, or administer the medications used in MAiD. This is a legal and ethical boundary; the medication must be self-administered by the client or administered by a qualified medical professional depending on local laws."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A trauma-informed approach to care (Lesson 3) utilizes the '4 Rs'. What does the 'Realize' component refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Realizing that the doula is the only person who can heal the client.",
                "Realizing that trauma is widespread and can affect how clients respond to end-of-life care.",
                "Realizing that medical records always contain the full history of a client's trauma.",
                "Realizing that trauma triggers only occur during physical touch."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Realizing involves understanding that trauma is nearly universal and that its impact on the nervous system can significantly influence a client's behavior, choices, and reactions during the dying process."

            "id": "q17_4",

                "The moment a client stops using social media.",
                "The loss of identity, agency, and human connection that often precedes physical death due to societal neglect.",
                "A legal term for when a person is declared dead in absentia.",
                "The phase of dying where a client no longer wishes to speak to friends."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social death occurs when a person is treated as if they are already gone or invisible by society. For the unhoused, this often happens long before biological death, making 'dignity work' a priority for the doula."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "According to developmental milestones in pediatric end-of-life care, at what age range do children typically begin to understand that death is universal, final, and irreversible?",

                "15 to 18 years old"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While younger children may see death as temporary or 'sleep,' children between 7 and 9 usually develop the cognitive maturity to understand that death is a permanent and universal part of life."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "For a neurodivergent client, particularly one with Autism, which environmental factor is most likely to cause 'sensory overload' during the active dying phase?",

                "Clear, literal communication about the physical process of dying."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent individuals often have heightened sensory sensitivities. Flickering lights, strong scents, or 'cocktail party' noise (multiple voices) can cause significant distress and agitation during the vulnerable dying phase."

            "id": "q17_7",

                "Demand the hospice nurse arrive within 10 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The doula's primary value in a crisis is their ability to remain calm. Practicing the 'Pause' allows the doula to respond with intention rather than reacting out of panic, which helps stabilize the room for the family."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key difference between MAiD and Voluntary Stopping of Eating and Drinking (VSED)?",
            "options": [
                "VSED requires a terminal diagnosis with a 6-month prognosis; MAiD does not.",
                "MAiD is legal in all 50 states; VSED is illegal in most.",
                "VSED is a self-directed process that does not require specific legislation to be legal; MAiD requires strict state-level legal frameworks.",
                "MAiD takes 7-14 days for death to occur; VSED takes 1-2 hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "VSED is a legally recognized right of any competent adult to refuse food and fluids. Unlike MAiD, which requires specific state laws and a terminal prognosis, VSED is a patient right available regardless of geography, though it requires significant support."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, the 'Zone of Helpfulness' is used to describe the ideal professional boundary. What lies on the ends of the spectrum outside this zone?",
            "options": [
                "Compassion and Empathy",
                "Under-involvement (neglect) and Over-involvement (boundary crossing/violation)",
                "Medical care and Spiritual care",
                "Paid support and Volunteer support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Zone of Helpfulness is the center of a spectrum. On one side is under-involvement (becoming distant or neglectful) and on the other is over-involvement (becoming enmeshed, taking over family roles, or violating professional boundaries)."

                "Managing the symptoms of chronic dementia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Young adults are in a stage of life focused on building identity, careers, and relationships. Dying at this stage is often viewed as an 'interruption' of a life just beginning, requiring the doula to focus heavily on legacy and the grief of unfulfilled potential."
