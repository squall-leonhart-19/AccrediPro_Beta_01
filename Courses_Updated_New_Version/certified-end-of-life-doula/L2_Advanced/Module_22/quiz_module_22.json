            "question": "A client's pain seems to be increasing, and they ask the End-of-Life Doula to increase the flow rate on their oxygen concentrator. What is the most ethically appropriate action within the Doula scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Adjust the oxygen flow as requested to ensure immediate comfort.",
                "Refuse to help and tell the client they must wait for the next nurse visit.",
                "Decline to adjust the medical equipment and immediately contact the hospice nurse or caregiver authorized to handle medical tasks.",
                "Check the client's vitals first and then adjust the oxygen if the saturation is below 90%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas operate in a non-medical scope. Adjusting medical equipment like oxygen flow is a clinical task that falls outside the Doula's professional boundaries and must be handled by licensed medical personnel or trained family caregivers."

        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "The principle of 'Patient Autonomy' in end-of-life care primarily dictates that:",
            "options": [
                "The doctor always makes the final decision based on clinical evidence.",
                "The family must reach a consensus before any action is taken.",
                "The client has the moral and legal right to make their own choices about their care, even if those choices conflict with the provider's values.",
                "The Doula should decide what is best for the client if the client is too tired to speak."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autonomy is the ethical requirement that the client's self-determination and personal values guide their care plan, regardless of whether the medical team or Doula agrees with the specific choice."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "In which of the following scenarios is a Doula ethically and legally obligated to breach client confidentiality?",
            "options": [
                "When the client's adult children ask for details about the client's private conversations.",
                "When the Doula believes the client is a victim of elder abuse or expresses a credible intent to harm themselves or others.",
                "When the hospice chaplain asks for an update on the client's spiritual state.",
                "When the Doula wants to share an inspiring story on social media without using the client's name."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While confidentiality is a cornerstone of Doula care, the 'duty to warn' and mandatory reporting laws for abuse or clear threats of harm override the privacy agreement."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A Doula is working with a client who offers a $2,000 cash 'bonus' above the agreed-upon fee. According to financial ethical standards, what is the best course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the gift as it shows the client values the work.",
                "Accept the gift but donate it to a charity in the client's name without telling them.",
                "Politely decline the gift, explaining that professional boundaries and ethical standards prevent the acceptance of large monetary gifts to avoid conflicts of interest.",
                "Accept the gift only if the family signs a waiver saying they won't sue later."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Accepting significant financial gifts can create a conflict of interest or the appearance of exploitation. Professional ethics require maintaining clear financial boundaries to protect the integrity of the Doula-client relationship."

            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "How does 'Cultural Humility' differ from 'Cultural Competence' in a Doula's ethical framework?",
            "options": [
                "Cultural Humility requires being an expert on every specific culture's death rituals.",
                "Cultural Humility is a lifelong process of self-reflection and acknowledging one's own biases, rather than reaching a 'finished' state of knowledge.",
                "Cultural Competence is only for medical professionals, while Humility is for Doulas.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable in professional practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility focuses on the practitioner's internal state and the power imbalance in the relationship, emphasizing that the client is the expert on their own cultural experience."

            "question": "A client in a state where Medical Aid in Dying (MAiD) is legal asks their Doula to be present during the ingestion of the medication. What is the Doula's ethical responsibility?",

                "The Doula must participate regardless of personal beliefs to support the client's autonomy.",
                "The Doula should provide the medication to the client to ensure the timing is correct.",
                "The Doula may choose to be present for emotional support but must not physically administer the medication; if they have a moral objection, they should refer the client to another Doula.",
                "The Doula is legally required to leave the house the moment the medication is touched."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas can ethically support a client's choice for MAiD through presence and emotional support, but they must never physically assist in the administration (which is a legal boundary). They also have the right to 'conscientious objection' and should refer the client if they cannot support the choice."

            "question": "Regarding the 'Ethics of Legacy,' who holds the primary ownership and final say over the content of a legacy project (like a video or memoir) created with a Doula?",
            "options": [
                "The Doula, as the creator and editor of the project.",
                "The client's family, as they will be the ones consuming the content.",
                "The client, as it is their narrative integrity and personal story being documented.",
                "The Doula's agency or certifying body."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative integrity belongs to the client. The Doula acts as a facilitator, but the client retains full ownership and control over how their story is told and shared."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Why is self-care categorized as an 'ethical obligation' in the AccrediPro End-of-Life Doula standards?",
            "options": [
                "Because Doulas deserve to be happy.",
                "Because burnout and 'compassion fatigue' can lead to impaired judgment, boundary violations, and a decrease in the quality of care provided to the client.",
                "Because insurance companies require Doulas to document self-care hours.",
                "It is not an ethical obligation; it is strictly a personal lifestyle choice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-care is an ethical imperative because an impaired or exhausted Doula cannot provide safe, competent, or objective care, potentially harming the client through negligence or emotional instability."

            "id": "q22_9",

                "Comply with the family's request to keep the peace and ensure the client gets nutrition.",
                "Tell the family that VSED is a form of suicide and you cannot be involved.",
                "Uphold the client's autonomous decision for VSED and facilitate a family meeting to discuss the client's wishes and the family's distress.",
                "Report the family to the police for attempted interference."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Doula's primary ethical duty is to the client's expressed wishes and autonomy. Subverting the client's choice (VSED) at the family's request would be a violation of the client's rights and the Doula's professional integrity."

                "The psychological impact of death on both the Doula and the family."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rule of Double Effect is a key ethical concept in palliative care where an intervention (like high-dose morphine) is ethically permissible to relieve suffering, even if it carries the foreseen but unintended risk of shortening life."
