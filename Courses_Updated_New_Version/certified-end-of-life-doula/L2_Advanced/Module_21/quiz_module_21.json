            "question": "In the S.O.L.A.C.E. Care Plan Framework, what does the 'O' specifically represent regarding the doula's role?",
            "options": [
                "Ongoing Medical Oversight",
                "Objective Observation of physical and environmental cues",

                "Obligatory Reporting to state agencies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in S.O.L.A.C.E. stands for Observation, focusing on the doula's ability to objectively monitor the patient's non-verbal cues, environmental stressors, and symptom progression to inform the care team."

            "question": "When integrating with a medical team (Lesson 3), which action best defines the Doula’s role as an 'Advocate'?",
            "options": [
                "Adjusting the dosage of PRN pain medication when the nurse is away",
                "Providing a medical diagnosis for new symptoms observed",
                "Translating the patient's previously stated values into questions for the hospice physician",
                "Directing the family to ignore the hospice nurse's clinical advice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advocacy in a doula context involves being a bridge between the patient's values and the medical team, ensuring the patient's 'voice' is heard in clinical decision-making."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Legacy Mapping, when is the most effective time to schedule intensive 'Meaning-Making' activities?",
            "options": [
                "During the 'Active Dying' phase to ensure the family is present",
                "Immediately following the 'Surge' or 'Rally' phase",
                "During the 'Stable' or 'Yellow' zone of the care plan when energy levels are higher",
                "Only after the patient has lost consciousness to avoid emotional distress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Legacy Mapping should occur while the patient still has the cognitive and physical energy to participate, typically during the stable phases of their decline."

                "Increasing room lighting to ensure the patient can see their surroundings clearly",
                "Implementing a 'Low-Stim' protocol: dimming lights, reducing scent, and limiting visitors",
                "Playing upbeat music to distract the patient from their discomfort",
                "Encouraging the family to engage the patient in complex conversations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory planning for terminal agitation focuses on reducing environmental triggers. A 'Low-Stim' protocol helps minimize sensory overload which can exacerbate restlessness."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Spiritual Containment.' What is the primary goal of this strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To convert the patient to a specific religious tradition before death",
                "To provide a safe, non-judgmental space for the patient to express existential distress without trying to 'fix' it",
                "To ensure a priest or chaplain is present 24/7",
                "To suppress the patient's difficult emotions to keep the family calm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Containment is about 'holding space'—allowing the patient to process spiritual or existential pain without the doula imposing solutions or premature comfort."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "During the 'Transition Protocol' (Lesson 7), a patient experiences a 'Terminal Surge' (Rally). What is the doula's most appropriate action?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the family the patient is recovering and will likely be discharged",
                "Immediately stop all comfort measures as they are no longer needed",

                "Encourage the patient to perform vigorous physical exercise to capitalize on the energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Rally' is a well-documented phenomenon (occurring in approximately 30% of cases) that often precedes final decline. The doula should use this time for meaningful connection while preparing the family for what follows."

            "question": "What is the defining characteristic of a 'Dynamic Plan Adjustment' as described in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "The plan is written once at intake and never changed to maintain consistency",
                "The plan is updated in real-time based on the shifting 'Zones' (Green, Yellow, Red) of the patient's condition",
                "The plan only changes if the medical doctor issues a new prescription",
                "The plan is adjusted only after the patient has passed away"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dynamic adjustment means the doula care plan is a living document that evolves as the patient moves through different stages of the dying process."

            "question": "In the 'Advocacy' phase of S.O.L.A.C.E., if a family member's wishes conflict with the patient's written Advance Directive, the Doula should:",

                "Leave the home until the conflict is resolved"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The doula’s primary loyalty is to the patient’s stated wishes and dignity. Advocacy involves highlighting the patient's voice, especially when it is being overshadowed."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A patient is in the 'Red Zone' (Active Dying). They are breathing through their mouth, and their skin is cool to the touch. Which intervention from Lesson 5 (Comfort) is most appropriate?",

                "Offering a large meal to boost energy",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the active dying phase, comfort measures shift to symptom palliation, such as managing dryness (xerostomia) and maintaining warmth as circulation slows."

            "question": "Which of the following is an 'Objective Observation' (The 'O' in S.O.L.A.C.E.) rather than a subjective interpretation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective observations are measurable and observable facts (like respiratory rate or sounds) rather than interpretations of the patient's internal emotional state."
