            "question": "In a high-conflict family dynamic where one sibling is acting as 'The Denier' and blocking hospice enrollment, what is the Doula's most effective initial intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Directly confronting the sibling with medical facts about the prognosis",
                "Facilitating a 'values-based' conversation focused on the patient's stated wishes",
                "Siding with the majority of the family to reach a consensus",
                "Referring the case immediately to a legal mediator"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-conflict dynamics, focusing on the patient's autonomy and previously stated values helps de-escalate sibling rivalry and shifts the focus from 'who is right' to 'what the patient wanted.'"

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to developmental psychology used in pediatric end-of-life care, how does a child between the ages of 3 and 5 typically perceive death?",
            "options": [
                "As a permanent and universal biological process",
                "As a deep spiritual transition involving an afterlife",
                "As a temporary, reversible state or a form of sleep",
                "As a punishment for their own bad thoughts or actions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Preschool-aged children (3-5) often lack the concept of 'irreversibility' and may view death as temporary or like 'sleeping,' often asking when the person will wake up."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "When supporting a client with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) who is experiencing bulbar onset, what is the most critical communication adjustment for a Doula?",
            "options": [
                "Using only verbal cues to encourage the client to speak louder",
                "Implementing low-tech AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) tools early",
                "Waiting until the client is completely non-verbal to introduce signs",
                "Limiting communication to the primary caregiver only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bulbar onset ALS affects speech and swallowing early. Doulas should introduce low-tech communication tools (like eye-gaze boards or letter boards) early to preserve the client's agency."

            "id": "q16_4",

                "Documenting the timeline of the patient's final breaths"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Doula must never physically prepare, mix, or administer the medication in a MAID or VSED scenario, as this crosses the line into medical/legal territory and violates the non-medical scope of practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In sudden death, the Doula's role is stabilization—ensuring basic needs are met, 'holding space' for shock, and protecting the family from intrusive external pressures."

            "id": "q16_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While it varies based on the patient's underlying health, the typical VSED process leads to death within 5 to 14 days due to dehydration and organ failure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Validation Method focuses on the emotional truth of the client's experience rather than factual reality, which helps reduce agitation and preserves dignity."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Which 'Double Protection' phenomenon is frequently observed in pediatric end-of-life cases?",

                "The use of both hospice and curative treatments simultaneously"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Double Protection occurs when a terminally ill child tries to act 'brave' for their parents, and the parents try to act 'strong' for the child, often leading to a lack of honest communication."

            "id": "q16_9",

                "Strict cultural taboos against talking about death"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traditional hospice models often require a safe, fixed residence and a 24/7 primary caregiver, which creates a significant barrier for the unhoused population."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A family offers a Doula a $500 cash 'bonus' after a particularly difficult vigil. According to professional ethics, what is the best course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Accept it as a sign of their gratitude",
                "Accept it but donate it to a charity in the patient's name",
                "Politely decline, explaining that the agreed-upon fee is the limit of professional compensation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maintain professional boundaries and avoid the appearance of exploitation during a vulnerable time, Doulas should decline significant gifts or 'bonuses' beyond the agreed-upon contract."
