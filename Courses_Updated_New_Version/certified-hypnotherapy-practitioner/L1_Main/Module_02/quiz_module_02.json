            "question": "Which physiological state is primarily responsible for the 'heaviness' and 'immobility' often reported during a deep relaxation induction?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Nervous System dominance",
                "Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) activation",
                "Increased cortisol production",
                "Beta brainwave synchronization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PNS activation triggers the 'rest and digest' response, leading to muscle vasodilation and decreased heart rate, which manifests as physical heaviness."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) mastery, what is the 'Contrast Principle'?",
            "options": [
                "Comparing the client's relaxation to a previous session",
                "Alternating between loud and soft hypnotic suggestions",
                "Using physical tension to make the subsequent relaxation more perceptible",
                "Contrasting visual imagery with kinesthetic sensations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Contrast Principle involves tensing a muscle group for 5-10 seconds so that the neurological 'rebound' of relaxation is more intense and identifiable for the client."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Breathwork, why is the 'exhalation' phase emphasized for inducing trance?",
            "options": [
                "It increases oxygen saturation in the prefrontal cortex",
                "It stimulates the Vagus nerve and lowers the heart rate",
                "It prevents the client from speaking during induction",
                "It triggers the 'fight or flight' response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Controlled, elongated exhalation stimulates the Vagus nerve, which is the primary component of the Parasympathetic Nervous System, facilitating deep relaxation."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "The 'Braidism' technique (Eye Fixation) works primarily by inducing fatigue in which specific muscle?",

                "Orbicularis oculi",
                "Corrugator supercilii",

                "Temporalis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eye fixation causes fatigue in the levator palpebrae superioris (the muscle that keeps the eyelid open), making the suggestion that 'the eyes are becoming heavy' a physiological reality."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Vogt's Fractionation technique involves which of the following processes?",

                "Bringing the client out of trance and immediately re-inducing it",
                "Using mathematical puzzles to distract the conscious mind"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fractionation is the process of awakening a client and then immediately re-inducing trance; each 'fraction' usually results in a deeper state than the previous one."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "What is 'Analogue Marking' in the context of a practitioner's voice?",
            "options": [
                "Using a stopwatch to mark the timing of the induction",
                "Using subtle changes in volume or tonality to highlight specific embedded commands",
                "Tapping on a table to create a rhythmic beat",
                "Recording the session on an analogue device for better quality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Analogue marking is a paralinguistic tool where the practitioner uses voice shifts to signal to the client's subconscious that certain words or phrases are more significant."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Intellectual Resistance,' constantly analyzing the practitioner's words. Which induction strategy is most recommended?",

                "Terminating the session immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Utilization (an Ericksonian approach) involves taking the client's resistance (e.g., their analytical thoughts) and incorporating it into the induction as a way to deepen the trance."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "During a Sensory Narrative induction, why is it critical to include VAK (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic) descriptors?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client doesn't fall asleep",
                "To satisfy the legal requirements of hypnotherapy",
                "To engage different regions of the brain and create a more immersive experience",
                "To determine which sense the client uses least"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multisensory narratives engage the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, making the imagined experience feel more 'real' and effective for induction."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which brainwave state (4-7 Hz) is the primary target for deep hypnotic induction, often associated with increased suggestibility?",
            "options": [
                "Beta",
                "Alpha",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta waves (4-7 Hz) are associated with deep relaxation, REM sleep, and the 'hypnagogic' state where the subconscious is most receptive to suggestion."

            "id": "q2_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Staircase is a classic Narrative Deepener that uses spatial metaphors (descending) combined with counting to guide the client into a more profound state of trance."
