            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase A stands for Accessing the Subconscious Architecture, where the practitioner bypasses the critical faculty to interact directly with the subconscious mind."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing Trust and a 'Yes-Set' during the intake phase reduces conscious resistance and primes the client for suggestibility."

                "Direct suggestions are less effective than indirect ones in all cases",
                "Indirect suggestions require the client to be in a deeper state of trance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Indirect suggestions (Milton Model) are 'artfully vague,' allowing the client to internalize the suggestion in a way that is personally relevant to them."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To avoid 'anchoring the comedown,' the stimulus should be applied as the state is rising and released just before it reaches the absolute peak."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fractionation involves bringing a client out of trance and back in quickly, which significantly deepens the level of trance with each cycle."

                "To ensure the heart rate returns to a normal waking rhythm gradually",
                "To give the practitioner time to write notes",
                "To provide a structured re-orientation and integrate suggestions into the waking state",
                "Because the client cannot hear the practitioner without a count"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Counting up provides a structured transition that allows for integration of the work done in trance and ensures the client is fully alert and 'present' before leaving."

            "id": "q11_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing abreactions requires the practitioner to remain calm and facilitate the release safely, often by moving the client to a pre-established 'Safe Place' or resource state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For a first session, a 50/50 split is often recommended to ensure sufficient time for building rapport, addressing fears, and establishing clear targets before the work begins."
