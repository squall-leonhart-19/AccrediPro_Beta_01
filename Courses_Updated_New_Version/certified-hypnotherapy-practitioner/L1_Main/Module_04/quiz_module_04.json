            "question": "According to neuroimaging studies discussed in Lesson 1, which brain region is primarily responsible for the 'top-down' modulation of sensory input during hypnotic suggestion?",
            "options": [
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)",
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Medulla Oblongata"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is the 'executive' hub that modulates emotional and sensory processing, allowing hypnotic suggestions to alter the perception of pain or external stimuli."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Which of the following suggestions best exemplifies the 'Progressive' element of the Three Ps (Positive, Present, Progressive)?",
            "options": [
                "You do not feel any anxiety.",
                "You will be confident next week.",
                "You are increasingly noticing a sense of calm with every breath.",
                "Stop eating junk food now."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progressive suggestions use 'process' language (e.g., 'increasingly,' 'more and more') to bridge the gap between the current state and the goal, making the suggestion more believable to the subconscious."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In the context of suggestion models, a client with a high 'Internal Locus of Control' and high 'Psychological Reactance' would likely respond best to:",

                "Direct, authoritarian commands",
                "Indirect, permissive Milton Model patterns",

                "Standardized medical protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients with high reactance feel threatened by direct orders. Indirect, permissive language (e.g., 'You might notice...') allows them to feel in control of the process."

                "To provide a direct moral lesson for the conscious mind",
                "To mirror the structure of the client's problem while offering a symbolic solution",
                "To prove the hypnotherapist's creativity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Isomorphic metaphors map the structure of the client's real-world problem onto a story, allowing the subconscious to find a solution without triggering conscious resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This uses an embedded question ('I wonder...') to bypass the critical faculty and a presupposition ('your body knows how to heal') that the healing is already a fact."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "A client complains, 'I am so obsessive about my work.' The practitioner responds, 'It sounds like you have an incredible capacity for deep focus and attention to detail.' This is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Content reframing changes the meaning of a behavior by highlighting its positive attributes or utility in a different context."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which specific technique is most effective for overcoming 'Symptom Command' resistance in a client who is subconsciously 'holding onto' a habit for secondary gain?",

                "The 'Double Bind' (Illusion of Choice)",
                "Using 'Not' suggestions to trigger reverse psychology",
                "Reframing the secondary gain and integrating it into the suggestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Addressing the 'secondary gain' (the hidden benefit the client gets from the problem) ensures the subconscious doesn't sabotage the suggestion to protect that benefit."

                "'I see a bright future for you.'",
                "'That sounds like a plan that resonates with you.'",

                "'The path ahead looks very clear.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Auditory processors respond best to 'sound-based' predicates like 'sounds like,' 'resonates,' or 'harmony.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Raz showed that suggestions could prevent the brain from automatically processing word meaning, effectively 'turning off' the Stroop interference effect in highly suggestible subjects."

                "Lying to the client about the hypnotic state",
                "Letting the client choose their own music"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Double Bind (e.g., 'Would you like to enter a trance now, or in a few minutes?') gives the client a sense of autonomy while ensuring the therapeutic goal (entering trance) is met either way."
