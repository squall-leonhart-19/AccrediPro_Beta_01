            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Beneficence is the ethical duty to do good and act in ways that benefit the client. Non-maleficence, by contrast, is the duty to 'do no harm.'"

                "The scope of practice, fees, and the right to terminate the session at any time",
                "The personal contact information of other successful clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent must include the practitioner's scope of practice, fee structures, cancellation policies, and the client's right to withdraw consent or end the session at any time."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A client seeks hypnotherapy for 'chronic abdominal pain' but has not seen a physician in over a year. What is the ethically appropriate action for a hypnotherapist?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Working with physical pain without a medical diagnosis is outside the scope of practice for hypnotherapists. Ethical guidelines require medical clearance to ensure underlying pathology isn't being masked."

                "The transfer of session data from a paper file to a digital database"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner projects their own unresolved feelings or experiences onto the client, which can compromise objectivity and ethical boundaries."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confabulation is the brain's tendency to fill in memory gaps with fabricated information. In hypnosis, leading questions can cause clients to 'recall' events that never happened, leading to significant ethical and legal issues."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing an abreaction requires the practitioner to remain calm, ensure physical and emotional safety, and use 'here-and-now' grounding to stabilize the client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality is not absolute. Ethical and legal 'Duty to Warn' or 'Duty to Protect' mandates override confidentiality when there is a risk of suicide, homicide, or abuse of a child or vulnerable adult."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital ethics require the use of encryption and compliant platforms (like HIPAA in the US or GDPR in the EU) to protect sensitive client data from unauthorized access."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "Why is a 'Dual Relationship' (e.g., treating a close friend or family member) generally considered unethical in hypnotherapy?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive for the practitioner",
                "It blurs professional boundaries and can impair the practitioner's objectivity",
                "Hypnosis does not work on people you know personally",
                "It is illegal in all 50 states to hypnotize a family member"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships create a conflict of interest and complicate the power dynamic, making it difficult for the practitioner to remain objective and for the client to feel safe expressing certain issues."
