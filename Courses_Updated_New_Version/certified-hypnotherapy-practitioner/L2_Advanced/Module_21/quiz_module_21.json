            "question": "During the Advanced Intake and Diagnostic Assessment (L1), what is the primary purpose of identifying 'Secondary Gain'?",
            "options": [
                "To determine the client's financial ability to pay for extended treatment.",
                "To identify the hidden psychological benefits the client receives from maintaining their symptom.",
                "To assess the client's level of hypnotic suggestibility using a standardized scale.",
                "To ensure the client is not suffering from a contraindicated personality disorder."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the subconscious benefits a client derives from their condition (e.g., attention, avoidance of responsibility), which must be addressed in the treatment plan to prevent self-sabotage."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In the Hypnotherapeutic Case Conceptualization (L2), which component links the 'Presenting Problem' to the 'Proposed Intervention'?",
            "options": [
                "The Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) code.",
                "The client's insurance coverage details.",
                "The Hypnotic Mechanism of Action (HMA) or theoretical bridge.",
                "The client's demographic profile and age."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Case Conceptualization must provide a theoretical bridge (HMA) that explains how specific hypnotic interventions will resolve the underlying psychological drivers identified during intake."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Strategic Sequencing' model (L3), why is Ego Strengthening typically prioritized in the first 1-2 sessions of a multi-session arc?",
            "options": [
                "To build the client's internal resources and rapport before attempting high-intensity work like regression.",
                "Because regression is only effective after the third hour of cumulative trance.",
                "To ensure the client does not experience abreaction during the initial intake.",
                "To fulfill the legal requirements of the practitioner's liability insurance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Strategic sequencing dictates that clients need a foundation of emotional stability and 'ego strength' to safely process the more challenging material often uncovered in later regression or reframing sessions."

            "id": "q21_4",

                "The client's overall life satisfaction score one year after discharge."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proximal outcomes are immediate, measurable changes observed within or shortly after a session (like SUDs reduction), whereas distal outcomes are the long-term life changes that follow."

                "Treat the pain first using direct suggestion to prove hypnosis works.",
                "Use a bifurcated plan that addresses the 'Pain-Depression Cycle' by stabilizing sleep and affect first.",
                "Refer the client out immediately, as hypnotherapists cannot work with comorbid conditions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adaptive planning for comorbidities involves addressing the reciprocal relationship between conditions, often starting with stabilization (like sleep) to improve the client's capacity to handle both issues."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Interspersal Technique, popularized by Milton Erickson, involves 'interspersing' therapeutic suggestions within a larger narrative to bypass the critical conscious faculty."

                "Requiring the client to complete a written apology for their resistance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance management for reactant clients requires shifting from 'authoritarian' to 'permissive' or 'Ericksonian' styles, using language that emphasizes the client's autonomy."

                "To mentally rehearse successful coping strategies in high-risk future scenarios.",
                "To predict the exact date the client will no longer need therapy.",
                "To induce amnesia for the symptoms the client used to have."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future pacing is a relapse prevention tool where the client 'pre-experiences' potential challenges in trance and successfully applies their new hypnotic resources to those situations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Measurability is critical in treatment planning to validate the effectiveness of the interventions and make data-driven adjustments to the plan."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A practitioner notices a client is 'plateauing' at Session 4 of a 6-session plan. According to the Resistance Management lesson (L7), the first step should be:",
            "options": [
                "Immediately switch to a different modality like CBT.",
                "Increase the session frequency to three times per week.",
                "Re-evaluate the Case Conceptualization to see if a 'block' or 'secondary gain' was missed.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A plateau is often a sign that the initial case conceptualization was incomplete or that a new layer of resistance (like a secondary gain) has emerged, necessitating a plan modification."
