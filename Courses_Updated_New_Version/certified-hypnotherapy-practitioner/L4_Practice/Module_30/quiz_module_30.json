                "Specialists require fewer certifications to practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialization allows you to become an authority in a specific area (e.g., performance anxiety for athletes), which increases perceived value and allows for premium, outcome-based pricing."
