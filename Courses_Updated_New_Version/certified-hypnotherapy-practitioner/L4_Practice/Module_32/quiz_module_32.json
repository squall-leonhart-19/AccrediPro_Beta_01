            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypnotherapists are non-clinical practitioners; they must never diagnose, treat, or prescribe, as these actions are legally reserved for licensed medical or mental health professionals."

                "It identifies 'Secondary Gain' and 'Suggestibility' levels before the session begins",
                "It serves as a legal waiver that replaces the need for informed consent",
                "It automatically generates a script for the practitioner to read"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardized intake forms help identify psychological hurdles like Secondary Gain and the client's specific suggestibility profile, allowing for a more tailored and effective first session."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing aligns the client's investment with the outcome (e.g., becoming smoke-free) rather than the minutes spent in a chair, which increases perceived value and commitment."
