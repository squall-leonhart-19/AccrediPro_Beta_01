            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Critical Faculty is the part of the conscious mind that evaluates and filters suggestions. Hypnosis aims to temporarily bypass this faculty to communicate directly with the subconscious."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emergence is not just about waking up; it is about grounding the work done in trance and ensuring the client can apply their new insights in their waking life."
