            "question": "During a session, a client suddenly begins shaking uncontrollably and weeping intensely, seemingly reliving a past trauma without being aware of the therapist's voice. What is the most appropriate immediate intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Deepen the trance to help them move through the memory faster",
                "Use a firm, grounding voice to orient them to the present room and use their name",
                "Immediately wake them up using a standard 1-to-5 count",
                "Stay silent and allow the abreaction to exhaust itself naturally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In cases of emotional flooding or 'spontaneous abreaction,' the priority is grounding the client in the present ('here and now') to prevent retraumatization. Using the client's name and sensory orienting cues helps bring them back into their 'Window of Tolerance.'"

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "Which clinical 'red flag' in a client's intake form would most likely require a mandatory medical or psychiatric referral before proceeding with hypnotherapy for 'behavioral change'?",
            "options": [
                "A history of mild generalized anxiety",
                "Recent onset of auditory hallucinations or delusional thinking",
                "Grief following the loss of a pet six months ago",
                "Chronic tension headaches diagnosed by a GP"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, are beyond the scope of a standard hypnotherapy practice and require psychiatric evaluation. Hypnosis can potentially exacerbate dissociative or psychotic symptoms in unstable individuals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Dual Process Model' of grief discussed in Lesson 5, what is the primary goal of the practitioner when supporting a client in existential crisis?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client remains focused solely on 'Loss-Orientation' to process the pain",
                "To force the client into 'Restoration-Orientation' to avoid depression",
                "To facilitate 'oscillation' between processing the loss and adjusting to a new life",
                "To achieve 'closure' by helping the client forget the deceased"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model (Stroebe & Schut) suggests that healthy grieving involves an oscillation between Loss-Orientation (processing grief) and Restoration-Orientation (attending to life changes). Over-focusing on one can lead to complicated grief."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client with Chronic Pain Syndrome (Lesson 4) reports that their pain is '10/10' despite no clear organic cause found by doctors. This phenomenon, where the CNS remains in a state of high reactivity, is known as:",
            "options": [
                "Neuroplastic Pain",
                "Central Sensitization",
                "Psychogenic Paralysis",
                "Acute Nociception"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Central Sensitization occurs when the nervous system goes through a process called 'wind-up,' becoming regulated in a persistent state of high reactivity, which lowers the threshold for what causes pain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "When working with Complex PTSD (C-PTSD), why is standard 'Age Regression' often considered high-risk or contraindicated in the early stages of therapy?",
            "options": [
                "It is too time-consuming for the client",
                "It may lead to 'flooding' and retraumatization before the client has adequate coping resources",
                "Clients with C-PTSD are usually unable to enter a hypnotic state",
                "Regression only works for single-event 'Shock Trauma'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "C-PTSD involves multiple, prolonged traumas. Regressing a client without first building a 'Safe Place,' 'Container,' and emotional regulation skills can overwhelm their nervous system, leading to a breakdown rather than a breakthrough."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In the context of Substance Misuse (Lesson 6), the technique of 'Urge Surfing' teaches the client to:",
            "options": [
                "Distract themselves with exercise whenever a craving occurs",
                "Use hypnosis to suppress the craving until it disappears forever",
                "View the craving as a wave that will peak and subside without needing to act on it",
                "Substitute the drug of choice with a less harmful habit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Urge Surfing is a mindfulness-based hypnotic technique where the client observes the physical sensations of a craving without judgment, understanding that it is temporary and will pass (like a wave) if they don't 'feed' it."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "If a client expresses suicidal ideation during a session, what is the practitioner's first responsibility according to the protocol in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately call the police before the client leaves the room",
                "Assess the risk by asking about specific plans, means, and intent",
                "Hypnotize the client to instill 'positive thinking' and hope",
                "Terminate the session and refer them to a website"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The practitioner must perform a risk assessment. Asking directly about 'Plan, Means, and Intent' does not 'put the idea' in their head; rather, it allows the practitioner to determine the level of immediate danger and follow the appropriate safety protocol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Vicarious Trauma' as experienced by a hypnotherapy practitioner (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": [
                "General exhaustion due to working too many hours",
                "A shift in the practitioner's world-view and sense of safety resulting from exposure to client trauma",
                "Feeling angry at a client for not making progress",
                "The physical symptoms of a client manifesting in the therapist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike burnout (which is about workload), Vicarious Trauma is a 'transformation in the inner experience of the therapist' that comes from empathic engagement with traumatized clients, changing how the therapist views the world."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Secondary Gain' regarding a somatic symptom. What does this term imply in a clinical context?",
            "options": [
                "The client is faking the symptom for financial profit",
                "The symptom provides an unconscious benefit, such as avoiding a stressful work environment",
                "The client has two different illnesses at the same time",
                "The practitioner is charging a secondary fee for complex cases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the external advantages derived from an illness (e.g., attention, release from responsibilities). These 'benefits' can create unconscious resistance to recovery, which must be addressed hypnotically."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between a 'Safety Plan' and a 'No-Suicide Contract' in modern crisis management?",
            "options": [
                "A Safety Plan is a collaborative list of coping strategies; a No-Suicide Contract is a largely ineffective 'promise' to the therapist",
                "A No-Suicide Contract is legally binding, while a Safety Plan is not",
                "A Safety Plan is only for adults, while contracts are for children",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same document"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research shows that 'No-Suicide Contracts' are not clinically effective and may provide a false sense of security. Collaborative 'Safety Plans' focus on empowering the client with specific internal and external resources to use when in crisis."
