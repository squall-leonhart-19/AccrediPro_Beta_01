            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Spring, the warmth of the sun melts the Kapha that accumulated during Winter. Heavy/sweet foods at this time would exacerbate this 'liquefaction,' leading to allergies and respiratory issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ojas is the end product of perfect digestion and Dhatu metabolism. Depletion (Ojo-kshaya) manifests as poor immunity, constant fatigue, and 'mental fog' or anxiety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A coated tongue is a classic 'Darshana' indicator of Ama (toxins). It suggests that Agni is not effectively transforming food into nutrients, leaving undigested residue."

                "It is the Kapha time of day, ensuring the mind is stable and calm",
                "It is the Vata time of day (Brahmamuhurta), characterized by lightness and clarity",
                "It is the only time when Agni is naturally at its peak"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The early morning (2 AM - 6 AM) is governed by Vata. Waking during this time allows the individual to tap into the qualities of movement, lightness, and clarity essential for spiritual practice and elimination."
