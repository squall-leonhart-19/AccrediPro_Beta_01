            "options": [
                "To change the client's Prakriti to match their current lifestyle",
                "To identify the specific deviations in Gunas and Doshas from the birth constitution",
                "To suppress all Doshas until they are no longer detectable in the pulse",
                "To focus exclusively on the Prakriti and ignore the current symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Gap' represents the distance between the birth constitution (Prakriti) and the current state of imbalance (Vikriti). Clinical success depends on identifying these specific deviations to create a corrective protocol."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prasara is the third stage of Samprapti where the aggravated Doshas leave their original seats (like the colon for Vata) and begin to circulate throughout the body."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ama is characterized by its heavy (Guru), sticky (Pichila), and viscous (Tantumata) nature, which allows it to clog the Srotas (channels)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A thick, greasy coating (Jihwa Ama) indicates systemic toxins, and its location on the posterior third of the tongue specifically correlates to the colon and the lower digestive region."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sthana-samshraya is the fourth stage, known as 'localized' or 'site-relocation,' where the circulating Doshas find a weak tissue (Khavaigunya) and deposit there to begin the disease process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sanga refers to stagnation or blockage within a channel. In the Prana Vaha Srotas (respiratory channel), this might manifest as congestion or difficulty breathing."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pradjnapradha occurs when an individual knows a choice is harmful (like eating late at night) but chooses to do it anyway, making it a primary root cause of imbalance."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Case Study: A 42-year-old client presents with 'Saama Vata.' Symptoms include constipation, abdominal distention that worsens after eating, and a heavy feeling in the lower back. What is the defining difference between Saama Vata and Nirama Vata?",
            "options": [
                "Saama Vata is always caused by excess heat, while Nirama is caused by cold",
                "Saama Vata involves Vata mixed with undigested toxins (Ama), whereas Nirama is Vata without toxins",
                "Nirama Vata is only found in children",
                "Saama Vata cannot be treated with herbs, only with surgery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Saama Vata indicates that the Vata Dosha is 'with Ama' (toxins), which changes the treatment strategy to focus on clearing Ama before balancing Vata."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In the stage of 'Vyakti,' what is the practitioner finally able to do that was difficult in previous stages?",

                "Identify the birth constitution (Prakriti)",
                "Clearly diagnose a specific disease by its full name and clinical signs",
                "Prevent the Doshas from ever accumulating",
                "Reverse the disease using only meditation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vyakti is the fifth stage, 'Manifestation,' where the disease presents with its full, identifiable clinical signs and symptoms, making a clear diagnosis possible."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing the Root Imbalance Profile, why is it critical to identify the 'Mula' (root) of the Srotas involved?",
            "options": [
                "Because the Mula is the anatomical and functional starting point for treatment",
                "Because the Mula is always located in the brain",
                "Because the Mula tells us the client's astrological sign",
                "Because the Mula is only relevant in end-of-life care"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Mula (root) of a Srotas is its control center. For example, the Mula of the Annavaha Srotas (digestive tract) is the stomach and esophagus; treating the Mula is essential for resolving the channel's pathology."
