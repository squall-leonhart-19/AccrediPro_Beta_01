            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which of the 13 biological fires (Agnis) is considered the 'Master Fire' that regulates all others, including the 5 Bhutagnis and 7 Dhatvagnis?",
            "options": [
                "Jatharagni",
                "Sadhaka Pitta",
                "Ranjaka Agni",
                "Bhutagni"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Jatharagni, the central digestive fire located in the stomach and small intestine, is the primary Agni that governs the strength and function of all other metabolic fires in the body."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client reports variable appetite—sometimes they are ravenous, and other times they forget to eat entirely. They also experience frequent bloating and gas. Which state of Agni does this represent?",
            "options": [
                "Mandagni (Slow/Weak)",
                "Tikshnagni (Sharp/Hyperactive)",
                "Vishamagni (Irregular/Variable)",
                "Samagni (Balanced)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vishamagni is characterized by irregularity and is typically associated with Vata dosha imbalance, leading to unpredictable appetite and digestive discomfort like gas and bloating."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to the pathogenesis of Ama (Lesson 3), what is the primary result of 'Mandagni' (weak fire) acting upon food?",
            "options": [
                "The immediate creation of Ojas",
                "The formation of 'Amavisha' or toxic undigested food essence",
                "The rapid absorption of nutrients into the Dhatus",
                "The purification of the Srotas (channels)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When Agni is weak (Mandagni), it cannot fully transform food, resulting in 'Ama'—a sticky, toxic byproduct that clogs the channels and prevents proper nourishment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "What is the clinical distinction between 'Deepana' and 'Pachana' therapies in the Agni optimization process?",
            "options": [
                "Deepana treats the mind, while Pachana treats the body.",
                "Deepana kindles the digestive fire without digesting Ama; Pachana digests existing Ama without necessarily increasing fire.",
                "Deepana is only for Pitta types, while Pachana is only for Kapha types.",
                "There is no clinical distinction; the terms are used interchangeably."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deepana focuses on 'kindling' or stimulating the fire (like adding wood to a flame), whereas Pachana focuses on 'cooking' or neutralizing the toxic sludge (Ama) already present in the system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Which 'Kitchen Pharmacy' blend is traditionally composed of Black Pepper, Long Pepper (Pippali), and Ginger to stimulate Agni and clear Ama?",
            "options": [
                "Triphala",
                "Hingvastak",
                "Dashamula",
                "Trikatu"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Trikatu (meaning 'three pungents') is the classic Ayurvedic formula used to boost Jatharagni and clear respiratory and digestive congestion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Based on the Circadian Rhythm of Agni, why is it recommended to consume the largest meal of the day between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM?",
            "options": [
                "Because Vata is at its peak during this time.",
                "Because this coincides with the Pitta-dominant time of day when Jatharagni is naturally strongest.",
                "Because Kapha is lowest during this window, preventing weight gain.",
                "Because the body requires more glucose for afternoon work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pitta period of the day (10am-2pm) mirrors the solar peak, making Jatharagni most efficient at processing complex nutrients during this window."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Which specific Agni is responsible for the 'digestion' of sensory impressions, thoughts, and emotions in the mind?",
            "options": [
                "Prana Vayu",
                "Sadhaka Pitta (Mental Agni)",
                "Tejas",
                "Mahaadbhuta Agni"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sadhaka Pitta is the sub-dosha of Pitta (often referred to as Mental Agni) that resides in the heart and brain, responsible for processing emotional and cognitive data."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the P.R.A.N.A. Implementation Protocol, what does the 'R' stand for, and what is its primary focus?",
            "options": [
                "Rehydrate; focus on drinking 3 liters of cold water.",
                "Rekindle; focus on using Deepana herbs to stimulate the fire.",
                "Remove; focus on the surgical removal of toxins.",
                "Rest; focus on sleeping immediately after meals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in P.R.A.N.A. stands for Rekindle, which involves using specific appetizers and warming herbs to bring the digestive fire back to its optimal state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client has a thick, white coating on the tongue, feels heavy after eating, and experiences 'brain fog.' What is the most appropriate first-line Ayurvedic recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "A high-protein, raw salad diet to 'scrub' the gut.",
                "Increasing the intake of heavy dairy to soothe the stomach.",
                "Sipping warm ginger water (Pachana) and avoiding heavy, cold, or oily foods.",
                "A 48-hour total water fast to kill the bacteria."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A coated tongue and heaviness are hallmark signs of Ama. Pachana (using warm ginger water) helps digest the toxins, while avoiding heavy/cold foods prevents further Ama formation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Bhutagni' concept, what happens if the 'Parthiva Agni' (Earth fire) is weak?",
            "options": [
                "The person cannot digest liquids properly.",
                "The body cannot properly assimilate the earth element, leading to weakness in the bones and muscles.",
                "The person will experience excessive thirst.",
                "The person will have difficulty breathing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5 Bhutagnis transform the elemental components of food. If Parthiva Agni is weak, the earth element in food isn't processed, leading to deficiencies in the structures it governs, like bones and muscles."
