            "question": "According to the Shad Rasa (Six Tastes), which elements compose the Amla (Sour) taste, and what is its primary effect on the Doshas?",
            "options": [
                "Earth and Fire; increases Pitta and Kapha, decreases Vata",
                "Water and Fire; increases Pitta and Vata, decreases Kapha",
                "Air and Space; increases Vata, decreases Pitta and Kapha",
                "Earth and Water; increases Kapha, decreases Vata and Pitta"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Amla (Sour) is composed of Earth and Fire elements. It is heating and moist, which pacifies Vata but increases both Pitta (due to fire) and Kapha (due to earth/heaviness)."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the study of Vipaka (Post-Digestive Effect), what is the final metabolic result of consuming tastes that are Pungent (Katu), Bitter (Tikta), or Astringent (Kashaya)?",
            "options": [
                "Madhura (Sweet) Vipaka",
                "Amla (Sour) Vipaka",
                "Katu (Pungent) Vipaka",
                "Lavana (Salty) Vipaka"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While there are six tastes, there are only three Vipakas. Pungent, Bitter, and Astringent tastes all result in a Katu (Pungent) Vipaka, which is generally catabolic and increases Vata."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic skin inflammation and digestive heat. According to Viruddha Ahara (Incompatible Foods), which of their common breakfast habits is most likely contributing to this 'Amavisha'?",
            "options": [
                "Oatmeal with cinnamon and honey",
                "A smoothie containing milk and sour berries",
                "Whole grain toast with avocado and sea salt",
                "Steamed apples with ghee and cardamom"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Combining milk with sour fruits (like berries or citrus) is a classic example of Viruddha Ahara. The acid in the fruit curdles the milk in the GI tract, creating toxins (Ama) that often manifest as skin disorders."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "During the Grishma Ritu (Summer season), when the sun depletes the moisture of the earth, which dietary protocol is recommended by Ritucharya?",

                "Consuming heavy, fatty meats to build strength",
                "Prioritizing Sweet (Madhura), Cold (Sheeta), and Liquid (Drava) foods",
                "Strict fasting to reduce the digestive load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Summer (Grishma), Agni is naturally low and the body is prone to dehydration. Ayurveda recommends Sweet, Cold, and Liquid foods (like coconut water or sweet fruits) to counteract the external heat and dryness."

                "Spicy chili with beans and no added fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vata is Cold, Light, and Dry. To balance this, the diet must be Warm, Heavy, and Oily (Snehana). Kitchari with ghee provides the necessary warmth and lubrication to soothe the Vata nervous system and colon."

                "Increasing the bulk of the stool to treat diarrhea"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trikatu (The Three Pungents) is a powerful bio-enhancer and digestive stimulant. It increases 'Agni' (digestive fire) and helps digest 'Ama' (metabolic waste)."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "According to the Ayurvedic Art of Conscious Consumption, what is the ideal distribution of stomach capacity during a meal?",

                "100% Solid to maximize nutrient density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ayurveda teaches that for proper churning and digestion, the stomach should be filled 1/2 with solid food, 1/4 with liquids, and 1/4 should remain empty (air/space) to allow for the movement of Doshas."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the Virya (Potency) of Ghee (Clarified Butter) and its specific effect on the body?",
            "options": [
                "Ushna (Heating); increases metabolic rate and Pitta",

                "Ushna (Heating); scrapes fat and reduces Kapha",
                "Sheeta (Cooling); increases Ama and congestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ghee has a Sheeta (Cooling) Virya. Despite being a fat, it is unique because it kindles Agni without increasing Pitta, making it excellent for nourishing the tissues and building Ojas."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In the context of Sattvic eating habits, why is it recommended to avoid eating while distracted (e.g., watching TV or working)?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the food to lose its nutritional value instantly",
                "It redirects Prana away from the digestive system, weakening Agni",
                "It makes the food taste more Bitter (Tikta)",
                "It is only a spiritual recommendation with no physical impact"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digestion is a Prana-intensive process. When the mind is distracted, Prana is diverted to the senses or intellect, leading to incomplete digestion and the formation of Ama."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which taste is considered the most 'catabolic' or 'reducing' (Lekhana), often used in Ayurveda to scrape away excess Kapha and fat?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Bitter (Tikta) taste is composed of Air and Space. It is the most cooling and drying of all tastes, giving it a 'scraping' (Lekhana) quality that reduces fat, toxins, and Kapha."
