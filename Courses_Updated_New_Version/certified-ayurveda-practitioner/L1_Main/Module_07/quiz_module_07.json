            "question": "According to the principles of Dinacharya and Circadian Medicine, which biological window is characterized by the 'Pitta cycle' of internal metabolic processing and tissue repair?",
            "options": ["6:00 AM to 10:00 AM", "10:00 AM to 2:00 PM", "10:00 PM to 2:00 AM", "2:00 AM to 6:00 AM"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The nighttime Pitta cycle (10 PM – 2 AM) is the period when the body focuses on internal 'cooking' or transformation, including liver detoxification and cellular repair, rather than external digestion."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Brahma Muhurta, the 'time of Brahman,' is traditionally cited as the most auspicious time for spiritual practice. Physiologically, what occurs during this window approximately 96 minutes before sunrise?",
            "options": ["A spike in cortisol to prepare the body for stress", "A peak in atmospheric Prana and a natural shift from melatonin to serotonin", "The highest accumulation of Kapha in the respiratory system", "A total cessation of Vata activity in the nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brahma Muhurta is characterized by a high concentration of nascent oxygen and Prana. It marks the transition where melatonin begins to drop and the system prepares for cognitive clarity through serotonin modulation."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In the study of Nidra (Sleep), Ayurveda describes 'Bhutadhatri,' meaning the 'nurse of the world.' Which subtle substance is primarily replenished during deep, restorative sleep?",
            "options": ["Tejas", "Prana", "Ojas", "Rajas"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ojas is the refined essence of all Dhatus (tissues) and is specifically replenished during deep sleep (Nidra), which acts as a stabilizing and nourishing force for the immune system."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "During the transition period known as 'Ritu Sandhi,' how should a practitioner advise a client to adjust their regimen?",
            "options": ["Abruptly switch to the new season's diet on the day of the equinox", "Maintain the previous season's diet for 30 days to ensure stability", "Gradually phase out the old regimen and introduce the new one over a 14-day period", "Fast for the entire duration of the transition to clear all Doshas"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ritu Sandhi is the 14-day 'seasonal junction' (7 days of the ending season and 7 days of the beginning season) where regimens must be gradually transitioned to prevent 'Asatmya' (unwholesome) reactions."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic inflammation, 'burnout,' and a sharp, critical mental state. In the context of the Subtle Triad, which imbalance is most likely present?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tejas is the subtle essence of Pitta. When aggravated or 'burning out of control,' it consumes Ojas, leading to inflammation, irritability, and physical exhaustion."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Gandha (Smell) is the Tanmatra of the Earth element. Aromatherapy and grounding scents are used to provide immediate stability to the nervous system via the limbic system."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rajas is the principle of motion and stimulation. While necessary for action and creativity, excessive Rajas leads to restlessness, anxiety, and a 'doing' obsession."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 72-hour rule suggests that for a new Ayurvedic recommendation to take root, the first action must be taken within three days to capitalize on the client's initial motivation and neuroplasticity."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Spring (Vasanta), the increasing heat of the sun liquefies the Kapha that accumulated during Winter, leading to its provocation (Prakopa) and common symptoms like allergies or congestion."

            "explanation": "Prana is the subtle essence of Vata; it is the master controller of all motor and sensory functions and the bridge between the physical body and consciousness."
