            "question": "According to Ayurvedic physiology, 'Para Ojas' is considered the most refined essence of vitality. Where is it primarily located and what is its specific volume?",
            "options": [
                "Distributed throughout the entire body; 1/2 Anjali",
                "Located in the heart; exactly 8 drops",
                "Stored in the liver and spleen; 13 drops",
                "Circulating in the plasma (Rasa); 1 Anjali"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Para Ojas is the 'superior' ojas, consisting of exactly 8 drops located in the heart. Its depletion is considered life-threatening, unlike Apara Ojas which circulates throughout the body in a volume of 1/2 Anjali."

                "96 minutes (2 Muhurtas) before sunrise",
                "At the exact moment the sun crosses the horizon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Brahma Muhurta is defined as 1 hour and 36 minutes (two 48-minute Muhurtas) before sunrise. This period is characterized by high levels of nascent oxygen and a specific sattvic quality of mind."

            "question": "A client presents with high Vata, dry skin, and chronic anxiety. When performing Abhyanga, which mechanism explains the reduction in serum cortisol and increase in oxytocin?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulation of Meissner's corpuscles and Vagus nerve activation",
                "The chemical reaction of tannins in the sesame oil",

                "Suppression of the lymphatic system's drainage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Abhyanga works through the skin (the organ of Vata). The rhythmic pressure stimulates mechanoreceptors like Meissner's corpuscles, which triggers the parasympathetic nervous system via the Vagus nerve, leading to hormonal balance."

            "question": "In the context of Nidra (Sleep), Ayurveda identifies the period between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM as 'Pitta Time.' What is the primary physiological consequence of staying awake during this window?",

                "Enhanced cognitive memory consolidation",
                "Impaired 'Ranjaka Pitta' function and liver detoxification",

                "Suppression of Vata in the colon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Staying awake during the 10 PM - 2 AM Pitta window forces the body to use energy for mental activity rather than the internal 'cooking' or detoxification performed by the liver and metabolic enzymes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ayurveda states 'Nasa Hi Shiraso Dwaram' (The nose is the gateway to the head). Nasya delivers lipids to the Shringataka Marma, influencing the hypothalamus and the blood-brain barrier."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ardha Shakti means 'half-strength.' The classical signs of reaching this limit include sweat on the forehead and nose, and the onset of mouth-breathing. Exercising beyond this can deplete Ojas."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ayurveda distinguishes between physical urges (Adharaniya Vega), which should never be suppressed, and psychological urges (Dharaniya Vega) like greed, anger, and jealousy, which must be restrained for Sadvritta (ethical living)."
