            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "In the context of 'Quantum Physiology' (Lesson 1), which level of existence is responsible for the 'causal' information that governs Dosha expression before it manifests physically?",
            "options": ["Sthula Sharira (Gross Body)", "Sukshma Sharira (Subtle Body)", "Karana Sharira (Causal Body)", "Annamaya Kosha (Food Sheath)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Karana Sharira is the causal body/field where the blueprint of the individual (including Dosha tendencies) resides at a quantum level before manifesting in the subtle or gross bodies."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "When performing Advanced Prakriti Profiling (The 'P' in PRANA), which factor is considered the fixed genetic 'blueprint' established at the moment of conception?",
            "options": ["Janma Prakriti", "Deha Prakriti", "Manasa Prakriti", "Vikriti"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Janma Prakriti refers to the constitutional type determined at birth/conception, which remains constant throughout life, unlike Vikriti which is the current state of imbalance."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "The 'R' in the PRANA framework stands for 'Resonance/Deviation.' What is the primary clinical objective when mapping the deviation between Vikriti and Prakriti?",
            "options": ["To change the client's Prakriti to a more balanced type", "To identify the 'gap' or distance between the current state and the original blueprint", "To increase all three Doshas simultaneously", "To ignore the Prakriti and only treat the symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mapping the deviation involves identifying how far the client's current state (Vikriti) has moved from their natural baseline (Prakriti) to determine the direction of treatment."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a thick, white, 'cheese-like' coating on the tongue and reports feeling heavy and lethargic after meals. According to Lesson 4, these are hallmark signs of:",
            "options": ["High Ojas", "Samagni (Balanced Digestion)", "Ama (Metabolic Toxins)", "Tejas (Metabolic Fire)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A thick tongue coating, heaviness, and lethargy are classic clinical indicators of Ama, which results from undigested food and metabolic waste."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which state of Agni (Lesson 5) is characterized by 'irregularity,' where digestion is sometimes strong and sometimes weak, often associated with a Vata imbalance?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vishamagni is the 'irregular' state of digestion typically caused by Vata Dosha, leading to variable appetite, bloating, and gas."

            "question": "According to the sequential nourishment of the Seven Dhatus (Lesson 6), which tissue is the immediate precursor (nourisher) of Medas (Fat/Adipose tissue)?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the sequential flow (Kshira-Dadhi Nyaya), Mamsa (Muscle) provides the raw materials and nourishment for the creation of Medas (Fat)."

            "id": "q13_7",

            "options": ["Excessive flow or overflow", "Flow in the wrong direction", "Stagnation or obstruction in the channel", "Growth of a tumor or nodule"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sanga refers to stagnation, accumulation, or obstruction within the channels (Srotas), preventing the free flow of nutrients or waste."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "When integrating the PRANA framework (Lesson 8), which step involves identifying the 'Nidana' or the root causes (lifestyle, diet, environment) that led to the current Vikriti?",
            "options": ["The 'P' phase", "The 'R' phase", "The 'A' phase", "The 'N' phase"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'N' in PRANA stands for Nidana (Etiology), which is the investigation into the causative factors behind the client's imbalances."

            "options": ["Pitta-Vikriti (Vridhi)", "Vata-Vikriti (Kshaya)", "Kapha-Vikriti (Sama)", "Samagni"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When symptoms match the dominant Dosha of the Prakriti, it is a 'Pitta-Vikriti' (an increase or Vridhi of Pitta), requiring cooling and pacifying interventions."

            "id": "q13_10",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ojas is the final, most refined byproduct of the Dhatu transformation process, representing the body's ultimate reserve of strength and immunity."
