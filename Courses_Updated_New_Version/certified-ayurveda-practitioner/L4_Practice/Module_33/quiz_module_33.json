            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners who are not licensed medical doctors cannot 'prescribe' herbs to 'treat' a specific medical 'disease' like hypertension. Doing so constitutes practicing medicine without a license."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIPAA applies to 'Covered Entities.' If a practitioner does not bill insurance electronically or perform other 'covered transactions' digitally, they may not be a covered entity, though maintaining HIPAA-level privacy is still a best practice."
