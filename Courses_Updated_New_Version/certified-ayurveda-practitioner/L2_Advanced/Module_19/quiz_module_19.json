            "question": "In the field of Ayurgenomics, research has identified that individuals with a dominant 'Pitta' Prakriti often show higher expression of genes related to which biological process?",
            "options": [
                "Inflammation and oxidative stress pathways (e.g., HLA-DRB1)",
                "Cell cycle regulation and structural integrity",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Studies in Ayurgenomics have correlated Pitta Prakriti with higher expression of inflammatory markers and immune-related genes like HLA-DRB1, reflecting the 'hot' and reactive nature of this constitution."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A 2011 landmark double-blind RCT published in the journal 'Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases' compared Ayurvedic treatment to Methotrexate for Rheumatoid Arthritis (Amavata). What was the primary finding?",
            "options": [
                "Methotrexate was significantly more effective at reducing joint swelling.",
                "Ayurveda was effective but only when combined with pharmaceutical intervention.",
                "Ayurvedic treatment showed equivalent efficacy to Methotrexate with significantly fewer side effects.",
                "The study was inconclusive due to high dropout rates in the Ayurvedic group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This landmark study demonstrated that a comprehensive Ayurvedic protocol (including herbs and lifestyle) was as effective as the gold-standard drug Methotrexate for RA, validating the 'Whole Systems' approach."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "When examining the Gut-Microbiome axis, modern research correlates 'Mandagni' (low digestive fire) and the accumulation of 'Ama' with which physiological state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ama is increasingly understood as the metabolic byproduct of incomplete digestion, which correlates with dysbiosis and the leakage of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the bloodstream, causing systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ayurgenomics research has indicated that Kapha-dominant individuals often exhibit slower metabolic rates for certain drugs (Poor Metabolizers) compared to the faster metabolism often seen in Vata or Pitta types."

            "id": "q19_5",

            "options": [
                "A trial where the ingredients of the herbal formula are kept secret from the patient.",
                "A study where the specific intervention is individualized for each patient, but the overall outcome of the system is measured.",
                "A laboratory setting where no light is allowed to touch the herbal extracts.",
                "A computer-modeled simulation of Ayurvedic pathophysiology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Black-box' design allows practitioners to use the full range of Ayurvedic tools (diet, herbs, lifestyle) tailored to the individual, while researchers measure the final clinical outcome, respecting the holistic nature of the system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The early morning Kapha period aligns with the body's natural peak in cortisol, supporting the Ayurvedic recommendation for vigorous activity (Vyayama) and waking before sunrise."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research shows that the 'entourage effect' of whole-plant extracts provides a buffering effect, where secondary metabolites reduce potential toxicity and enhance the bioavailability of active compounds."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Reductionist' research and 'Systems Biology' in the context of Ayurveda?",
            "options": [
                "Reductionism looks at the whole person, while Systems Biology looks only at genes.",
                "Reductionism isolates a single molecule (e.g., Curcumin), while Systems Biology studies the interaction of multiple variables (e.g., Agni, Microbiome, Lifestyle).",
                "Systems Biology is only used for plants, while Reductionism is used for humans.",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same methodology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ayurveda is a systems-based medicine. While reductionism isolates single variables, Systems Biology aligns with Ayurveda by looking at the complex, non-linear interactions within the whole organism."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Preliminary research has suggested that Kapha types often have a higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, which is also associated in modern science with increased energy harvest and a predisposition to weight gain."
