            "id": "q21_1",
            "question": "In the 'Architecture of a Clinical Protocol,' what is the mandatory first step before any tonification (Brimhana) therapy can be safely administered?",
            "options": [
                "Clearing Ama and restoring Agni (Deepana-Pachana)",
                "Administering Rasayana (rejuvenative) herbs",
                "Increasing the patient's caloric intake",
                "Prescribing heavy medicated ghees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Administering tonification (Brimhana) while Ama is present will only strengthen the toxins and further clog the Srotas (channels). Deepana-Pachana is the essential prerequisite."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a Vata Prakriti (constitution) but is currently suffering from acute Pitta Vikriti (imbalance) involving acid reflux and skin rashes. According to the 'Inverse Logic' of treatment planning, how should you proceed?",
            "options": [
                "Treat the Vata Prakriti first to stabilize the foundation",
                "Treat the Pitta Vikriti first as it is the current state of distress",
                "Treat both simultaneously with equal intensity",
                "Ignore the Vikriti and focus only on long-term lifestyle changes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical priority is almost always given to the Vikriti (the current imbalance), especially when acute. Once the Pitta is pacified, the protocol can shift toward managing the Vata Prakriti."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Which state of Agni is characterized by 'Vishamagni' and requires the use of warming, carminative herbs like Hing and Ginger?",
            "options": [
                "Tikshnagni (Hyperactive digestion)",
                "Mandagni (Slow/Hypoactive digestion)",
                "Vishamagni (Irregular/Variable digestion)",
                "Samagni (Balanced digestion)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vishamagni is the irregular state of Agni associated with Vata, where digestion varies daily. Carminative and warming herbs help stabilize this erratic fire."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "In the 6 Stages of Samprapti (Pathogenesis), the 'Prasara' stage is critical because it represents:",
            "options": [
                "The initial accumulation of Doshas in their home sites",
                "The manifestation of clear, identifiable clinical symptoms",
                "The overflow and migration of Doshas throughout the body via the Srotas",
                "The localization of Doshas in a weak tissue (Khavaigunya)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prasara is the third stage of Samprapti, where the Doshas leave their primary sites and begin to circulate, looking for a weak spot (Khavaigunya) to settle."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "When formulating an advanced herbal protocol (Dravya Guna), what is the primary role of the 'Anupana' (vehicle)?",
            "options": [
                "To act as the main active ingredient for the disease",
                "To neutralize the taste of bitter herbs",
                "To carry the herb to specific tissues and enhance bioavailability",
                "To increase the shelf life of the herbal powder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Anupana (such as warm water, honey, or milk) acts as a catalyst and carrier, directing the 'Pradhana Dravya' (main herb) to the targeted Dhatu (tissue)."

            "id": "q21_6",

            "options": [
                "Increasing Sweet, Sour, and Salty tastes",
                "Prioritizing Pungent, Bitter, and Astringent tastes",

                "A diet consisting primarily of raw, unseasoned vegetables"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pungent, Bitter, and Astringent tastes are catabolic and drying, making them ideal for reducing the heavy, moist, and stable qualities of Kapha."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Awakened Vitality' lesson, which subtle therapy is specifically indicated for 'Prana Vata' disorders such as anxiety and insomnia?",

                "High-intensity light exposure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nadi Shodhana is the gold standard for balancing Prana Vata, as it calms the nervous system and balances the solar and lunar energies in the body."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "During Case Management and Protocol Refinement, if a client experiences 'healing crisis' symptoms (mild headache/fatigue) in the first 3 days, this is often a sign of:",
            "options": [
                "The wrong diagnosis was made",
                "The Doshas are being mobilized and Ama is being processed",
                "A severe allergic reaction to the herbs",
                "The need to immediately stop all interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Initial mild discomfort often indicates that the protocol is successfully mobilizing stagnant Doshas or processing Ama, though it must be monitored to ensure it doesn't escalate."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Which stage of Samprapti is the 'Point of No Return' where a disease shifts from being 'Easily Curable' to 'Difficult to Cure' or 'Chronic'?",
            "options": [
                "Sanchaya (Accumulation)",

                "Vyakti (Manifestation)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sthana Samshraya is where the Dosha lodges in a Dhatu (tissue). Once the Dosha-Dhatu Sammurchana (amalgamation) occurs, the disease becomes much harder to reverse."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A practitioner notices a client has a 'coated tongue' and 'heavy' pulse. Which sequencing error would be most detrimental at this time?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing light, warm soups",
                "Performing Abhyanga (oil massage) with heavy oils",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Performing Snehana (oleation/oil massage) while Ama (indicated by the coated tongue) is present will 'lock' the toxins into the tissues, making them much harder to clear later."
