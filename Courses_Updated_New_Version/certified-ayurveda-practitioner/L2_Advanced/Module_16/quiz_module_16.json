            "question": "In the management of advanced Vata-driven neurological disorders like Parkinson’s (Kampavata), which oil is preferred for Basti and Shirodhara due to its specific 'Balya' (strengthening) effect on the nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Pinda Taila",
                "Dhanwantaram Taila",
                "Maha Marichadi Taila",
                "Kshirabala 101 Taila"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dhanwantaram Taila is a classic choice for Vata disorders involving the nervous system and musculoskeletal system due to its nourishing and grounding properties."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "When treating stubborn Pitta-predominant autoimmune conditions like Psoriasis, why is 'Deepana-Pachana' (kindling digestion and digesting toxins) prioritized before any building therapy?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the patient's appetite for Rasayana herbs",
                "To reduce the heat of the liver (Yakrit) immediately",
                "To clear Ama (metabolic waste) that prevents the proper recognition of self-cells",
                "To ensure the patient can tolerate heavy ghee preparations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune conditions, Ama coats the cells and confuses the immune system; clearing this 'obstruction' is essential before attempting to modulate the immune response."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In chronic Type 2 Diabetes (Prameha) that has progressed to the 'Dhatu Kshaya' stage, which dosha typically becomes the primary driver of complications like neuropathy and retinopathy?",
            "options": [
                "Vata",
                "Pitta",
                "Kapha",
                "Rakta"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While Prameha begins as a Kapha-dominant condition, chronic depletion (Dhatu Kshaya) eventually leads to a Vata imbalance, which manifests as neurological and degenerative complications."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A patient presents with a 'Sannipataja' condition involving both severe inflammation (Pitta) and significant depletion (Vata). According to the principle of 'Atyayika' (emergency/acute) care, which should be addressed first?",
            "options": [
                "The Vata depletion, because Vata is the master dosha",
                "The Kapha secondary involvement to clear the path",
                "The most aggravated dosha or the one causing the most acute tissue damage",
                "Both doshas simultaneously with equal intensity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex multi-dosha cases, the practitioner must first address the dosha causing the most acute distress or 'Atyayika' (emergency) symptoms to stabilize the patient."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In advanced cases of PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome), the primary pathological mechanism is often identified as 'Srotas Avarodha'. Which doshas are typically responsible for this 'obstruction' of the reproductive channels?",
            "options": [
                "Vata and Pitta",
                "Kapha and Vata",
                "Pitta and Kapha",
                "Ojas and Tejas"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PCOS involves Kapha (excess tissue/cysts) obstructing the movement of Vata (hormonal flow and ovulation) within the Artava Vaha Srotas."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "For a patient suffering from clinical burnout and depression (Manas Vikaar) characterized by Tamas, what is the primary goal of 'Sattvaavajaya Chikitsa'?",
            "options": [
                "To increase Rajas to stimulate the mind into action",
                "To suppress Pitta to prevent irritability",
                "To balance Vata to reduce anxiety",
                "To cultivate Sattva guna to restore clarity and mental resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Sattvaavajaya Chikitsa is the Ayurvedic psychotherapy aimed at increasing Sattva (purity/clarity) to overcome the heaviness of Tamas or the agitation of Rajas."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "During integrative oncology support, why is 'Rasayana' therapy (such as Ashwagandha or Chyawanprash) often administered specifically *between* chemotherapy cycles rather than during the infusion days?",
            "options": [
                "Because the herbs interfere with the chemical uptake of the drugs",
                "To protect and replenish Dhatus (tissues) and Ojas from the 'Tikshna' (sharp) effects of treatment",
                "To ensure the patient doesn't experience nausea from the herbs",
                "To allow the Pitta of the chemotherapy to work without cooling interference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rasayana therapy between cycles helps the body recover its vital essence (Ojas) and rebuild healthy tissues that are often damaged by the 'Tikshna' (sharp/penetrating) nature of chemotherapy."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In geriatric case management (Jara), why must 'Snehana' (oleation) be applied with more caution than in younger adults, despite the natural Vata-dominance of old age?",
            "options": [
                "Because Agni (digestive fire) is often 'Manda' (weak) or 'Vishama' (irregular) in the elderly",
                "Because elderly patients have too much Kapha in their joints",
                "Because oil causes immediate Pitta aggravation in the skin",
                "Because Vata cannot be balanced by oil after the age of 70"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While elderly patients are Vata-dominant and need lubrication, their weakened Agni may not be able to process heavy amounts of oil, leading to the formation of Ama."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A pediatric patient presents with chronic Kapha-type respiratory congestion. According to the 'Adhisthana' (site) principle, which organ should be the focus of treatment to root out the cause?",
            "options": [
                "The Lungs (Phupphusa)",
                "The Heart (Hridaya)",
                "The Stomach (Amashaya)",
                "The Large Intestine (Pakvashaya)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Ayurveda, Kapha originates in the Amashaya (stomach). Treating the stomach (e.g., through diet and mild expectorants) is essential to stop the production of excess mucus that ends up in the lungs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A complex case study involves a patient with both Ulcerative Colitis (Pitta) and Osteoarthritis (Vata). Why does the practitioner prioritize healing the 'Grahani' (small intestine/gut lining) first?",
            "options": [
                "Because Pitta is more dangerous than Vata",
                "Because the Vata-balancing minerals and oils cannot be absorbed if the gut is inflamed",
                "Because Osteoarthritis is incurable in the presence of Pitta",
                "Because Grahani is the site of Kapha, which balances both"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "You cannot treat Vata-driven bone depletion if the 'Grahani' (absorption site) is inflamed and hyper-motile; the gut must be stabilized to allow for the assimilation of Vata-pacifying nutrients."
