            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prashna involves deep clinical questioning to understand the client's history, lifestyle, and mental state, often revealing the 'Khavaigunya' or internal predispositions that physical observation cannot."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "question": "During Jihva Pariksha (Tongue Analysis), a practitioner observes a thick, yellowish coating concentrated at the very back (posterior) of the tongue. This most likely indicates Ama in which location?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The posterior third of the tongue corresponds to the lower abdomen and colon (Pakvashaya). A thick coating here indicates accumulated toxins (Ama) in the Vata zone."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Janma Prakriti is the absolute genetic blueprint at conception, whereas Deha Prakriti is the physical manifestation influenced by the mother’s diet and lifestyle during gestation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Agni evaluation in the P.R.A.N.A. synthesis involves assessing the digestive capacity, metabolic efficiency, and the 'Bhutagni' (elemental transformation) levels."

            "question": "A client presents with a 'Mandagni' (sluggish digestion), a tongue with a thick white coat and scalloped edges, and a slow, slippery pulse. Using Vikriti Logic, what is the primary focus of the assessment summary?",
