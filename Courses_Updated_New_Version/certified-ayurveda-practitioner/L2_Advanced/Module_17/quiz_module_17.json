            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client presents with high Vata (severe anxiety and insomnia) and high Pitta (burning indigestion and skin rashes). According to the 'Primary Mover' principle in Lesson 1, how should the practitioner prioritize treatment?",
            "options": [
                "Treat Pitta first because inflammation is always more dangerous than Vata.",
                "Treat Vata first using warming and oily substances, even if it aggravates Pitta.",
                "Treat Vata first using 'Cooling Vata-Pacifying' measures to ground the 'Primary Mover' without overheating.",
                "Ignore both and focus solely on Kapha to provide a buffer for the other doshas."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vata is the 'Primary Mover' and must be stabilized first, but in dual-doshic vikriti with Pitta, you must use cooling grounding methods (like coconut oil or sweet, grounding foods) rather than heating ones."

        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 2, how does Ama-Visha differ from standard Ama in the development of autoimmune conditions?",
            "options": [
                "Ama-Visha is simply 'cold' toxins, whereas Ama is 'hot'.",
                "Ama-Visha is reactive, acidic, and interacts with the immune system to create systemic inflammation.",
                "Ama-Visha only affects the digestive tract, whereas Ama affects the blood.",
                "Ama-Visha is always caused by external environmental pollutants only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ama-Visha is a more virulent, reactive form of toxins that has 'mixed' with Pitta or external poisons, leading to the immune system attacking the body's own tissues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the paradox of Metabolic Syndrome. Why is 'Dhatu-Kshaya' (tissue wasting) often found in clients who are simultaneously 'Medas-Vriddhi' (overweight)?",
            "options": [
                "Excess fat (Medas) blocks the flow of nutrition (Aharasa) to deeper tissues like muscle and bone.",
                "The client is likely exercising too much while eating too many calories.",
                "High Kapha naturally causes the destruction of Vata-based tissues.",
                "Metabolic syndrome only affects the skin and hair, not deeper tissues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In metabolic syndrome, the overgrowth of Medas (fat) creates Srotas-Avarodha (blockage), preventing subsequent Dhatus (Mamsa, Asthi, Majja) from receiving nourishment, leading to wasting despite weight gain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Trauma and Manas Vikriti, which sub-dosha is primarily responsible for 'processing and digesting' emotional experiences?",
            "options": [
                "Vyana Vayu",
                "Brajaka Pitta",
                "Sadhaka Pitta",
                "Tarpaka Kapha"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sadhaka Pitta, located in the heart/brain, is responsible for the 'digestion' of emotions and sensory input. Trauma often results in 'emotional Ama' due to low Sadhaka Agni."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A 75-year-old client shows signs of 'Dry Aging'—weight loss, tremors, and cognitive decline. Based on Lesson 5, which Rasayana strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive Shodhana (detoxification) to clear old toxins.",
                "Strict fasting to improve Agni and mental clarity.",
                "Sneha-ana (internal and external oleation) followed by Brimhana (building) Rasayanas.",
                "Increasing pungent spices to stimulate Vata."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Geriatric care (Jara Chikitsa) focuses on pacifying Vata and reversing Dhatu-Kshaya. Because Vata is naturally high in old age, oleation and building therapies are essential."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, the 'Hormonal Cascade' is often disrupted by a 'Reverse Flow' of which Vayu, leading to conditions like endometriosis or PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Prana Vayu",
                "Udana Vayu",
                "Apana Vayu",
                "Samana Vayu"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Apana Vayu governs the downward flow of menstruation and waste. When it becomes 'Udavarta' (upward moving or restricted), it disrupts the Artava Vaha Srotas (reproductive channel)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7 (Integrative Oncology), what is the primary clinical objective when supporting a client undergoing active chemotherapy?",
            "options": [
                "To use herbs that directly kill cancer cells independently of the chemo.",
                "To preserve Agni and Ojas to help the body tolerate the treatment and reduce side effects.",
                "To induce vomiting (Vamana) to clear the chemical toxins immediately.",
                "To stop all Ayurvedic supplements to ensure no interactions occur."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The role of the Ayurvedic practitioner in oncology is supportive, focusing on maintaining the 'vitality' (Ojas) and 'digestive fire' (Agni) so the patient can complete their medical protocol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client has followed their protocol perfectly for 3 months but has reached a weight-loss plateau and still feels fatigued. According to Lesson 8, what is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "The client needs to reduce their caloric intake further.",
                "The Doshas have returned to Prakriti.",
                "Deep-seated Ama is blocking the Srotas (channels), preventing the protocol from reaching the tissues.",
                "The practitioner should wait another 6 months before changing anything."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Plateaus often indicate 'Srotas-Avarodha' (channel blockage). When channels are blocked by Ama, even the best herbs and diet cannot be transported to the Dhatus effectively."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module regarding systemic inflammation showed that which Ayurvedic intervention resulted in a significant reduction in C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels?",
            "options": [
                "Cold water therapy",
                "High-intensity interval training",
                "Standardized Virechana (purgation) protocols",
                "High-dose caffeine administration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data shows that Panchakarma therapies, specifically Virechana, are highly effective at reducing systemic inflammatory markers like CRP by clearing Pitta-associated Ama-Visha."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "When dealing with 'Manas Vikriti' (mental imbalance) in a geriatric patient, why is Basti (medicated enema) often more effective than oral herbs alone?",
            "options": [
                "Elderly patients cannot swallow pills.",
                "Basti directly targets the seat of Vata (the colon), which has a direct nervous system link to the mind.",
                "Basti is cheaper and faster than oral herbs.",
                "The colon is where Pitta is processed, which cools the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Ayurveda, the Pakvashaya (colon) is the primary seat of Vata. By stabilizing Vata at its source via Basti, the practitioner can most effectively stabilize the 'Chala' (mobile) quality of the mind in the elderly."
