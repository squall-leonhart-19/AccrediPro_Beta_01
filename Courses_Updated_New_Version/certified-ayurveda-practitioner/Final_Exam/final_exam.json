                "To assess the presence of metabolic toxins (Ama) in the digestive tract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prakriti Profiling (the 'P' in P.R.A.N.A.) focuses on establishing the client's inherent constitution—their blueprint—which serves as the baseline for all subsequent interventions."

                "Ojas Kshaya (Depleted vitality)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A coated tongue, heaviness, and mental fog are classic clinical markers of Ama, which is identified during the Root Imbalance Identification phase to determine the depth of Vikriti."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tikshnagni (associated with Pitta) requires cooling and stabilizing influences. Stimulating spices would exacerbate the condition, while regular, grounding meals help manage the sharp intensity of the fire."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nature-Synced Nutrition aligns with Ritucharya (seasonal cycles). During Vata season, the qualities of warm, cooked, and unctuous (oily) foods help counteract the cold, dry, and light qualities of the environment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While Ayurveda acknowledges cosmic influences, the Dashavidha Pariksha focuses on clinical factors like Desha (habitat), Bala (strength), Vaya (age), Sara (tissue quality), and others to determine the strength of the patient vs. the disease."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In clinical practice, Vata is often treated first because it governs the movement of Pitta and Kapha. If Vata is deranged, it can 'push' other doshas out of balance (Pratiloma)."

            "id": "final_9",
