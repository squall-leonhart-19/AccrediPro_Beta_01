            "question": "When assessing Advanced Prakriti nuances, which factor is considered the most reliable indicator of a patient's 'Janma Prakriti' (birth constitution) versus their current 'Vikriti'?",
            "options": [
                "The current state of the tongue coating (Jihva Pariksha)",
                "The structural features and bone proportions that remain unchanged throughout life",
                "The patient's current emotional state and sleep patterns over the last 30 days",
                "The rapid pulse rate measured at the superficial level of the radial artery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Janma Prakriti is the fixed genetic constitution determined at conception. While physiological functions (Vikriti) fluctuate, structural markers like bone density, frame size, and eye shape are permanent indicators of the original Prakriti."

                "Level 7 (Deepest/Soul level)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In advanced pulse diagnosis, Level 3 is where the practitioner detects the 'Organ Pulse,' providing insight into the functional state of specific internal organs like the liver, heart, and kidneys."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Nails (Nakha) and hair (Kesha) are the 'Malas' (waste products) of Asthi Dhatu (bone tissue). If Asthi Dhatu Agni is low or impaired, the quality of these byproducts diminishes significantly."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, the priority is always to stop the influx of toxins (Nidana Parivarjana) and clear existing Ama (Deepana-Pachana) before attempting to rebuild or deeply detoxify the tissues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional ethics and scope of practice dictate that Ayurvedic practitioners must never advise a patient to discontinue or alter conventional medications prescribed by a physician. This is a boundary critical to patient safety and professional integrity."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Siras (veins/vessels) and Kandaras (tendons) are the Upadhatus of Rakta Dhatu. Issues like varicose veins or chronic tendonitis often point back to a disharmony in the Rakta Dhatu metabolism."
