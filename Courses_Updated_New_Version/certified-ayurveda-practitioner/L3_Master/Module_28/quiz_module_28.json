            "question": "In Advanced Samprapti, when a Dosha reaches the 'Majja Gata' (marrow/nerve tissue) stage, which clinical manifestation is most characteristic of this deep-tissue pathology?",
            "options": [
                "Superficial skin rashes and itching",
                "Mild digestive sluggishness and bloating",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Majja Gata Dosha represents deep-seated pathology affecting the nervous system and bone marrow, typically manifesting as tremors, sensory loss, or intense deep-seated pain."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "During an acute Vata crisis characterized by severe anxiety and 'Vata Vyadhi' (neurological instability), what is the immediate clinical priority in Ayurvedic crisis intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive Shodhana (purgation) to remove Vata",
                "Snehana (oleation) and Brimhana (nourishing) to ground and stabilize",
                "Langhana (fasting) to clear Ama from the channels",
                "Deepana (kindling agni) with hot, pungent spices like Hingu"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In an acute Vata crisis, the priority is stabilization through Snehana (oil application/ingestion) and Brimhana (nourishing therapies) to pacify Vata's mobile and dry qualities."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "When managing a 'Tridoshic Puzzle' where Vata, Pitta, and Kapha are all severely vitiated, which Dosha is traditionally prioritized for treatment first to prevent further systemic collapse?",
            "options": [
                "Vata, because it is the 'driver' of the other two Doshas",
                "Pitta, because inflammation is the most dangerous symptom",
                "Kapha, because it causes the most blockages (Srotas-rodha)",
                "Whichever Dosha is highest on the pulse reading regardless of symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vata is the only mobile Dosha and governs the movement of Pitta and Kapha. In complex cases, stabilizing Vata is essential to gain control over the systemic pathology."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "In the context of chronic Ama and autoimmune pathology (Amavisha), what is the primary risk of using Rasayana (rejuvenative) herbs prematurely?",
            "options": [
                "They will decrease the client's appetite too much",
                "They may 'feed' the Ama, leading to further channel blockage and inflammation",
                "They will cause excessive weight gain",
                "They have no effect if Ama is present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rasayanas are heavy and building. If given while 'Amavisha' (toxic Ama) is present, they can clog the Srotas further and exacerbate the autoimmune response."

            "question": "In advanced degenerative conditions (Dhatu Kshaya) where Ojas is severely depleted, why is standard Panchakarma often contraindicated?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client cannot afford the treatment",
                "The body lacks the 'Bala' (strength) to undergo the eliminative stress, which could further deplete Ojas",
                "Degenerative conditions are only treated with surgery",
                "Panchakarma is only for Kapha disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shodhana (detox) requires significant vital strength. In degenerative states where Dhatus and Ojas are already low, aggressive cleansing can be fatal or cause irreversible Vata aggravation."

                "Only treat the client using meditation to avoid all physical interactions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethics in an allopathic landscape require collaboration and safety, specifically checking for herb-drug interactions that could alter the efficacy of life-saving medications."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Amavata, oil (Abhyanga) is contraindicated in the acute stage as it can worsen the swelling. The first step must be digesting the Ama (Pachana) and lightening the system (Langhana)."
