            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "During the Clinical Mapping phase (L1), which element is considered the 'root' of the Samprapti (pathogenesis) that must be addressed before secondary symptoms?",
            "options": ["Dhatu Ksaya (Tissue depletion)", "Agni Mandya (Impaired digestion)", "Srotas (Channel) blockage", "Vaikruta Dosha (Aggravated Dosha)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In advanced clinical mapping, Agni Mandya is the primary root of most disease processes. Ayurveda teaches that no disease can exist without some level of Agni impairment, making it the first priority in clinical mapping."

        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In a Multi-Phase Agni Protocol (L2), what is the primary objective of the 'Deepana-Pachana' phase?",
            "options": ["To build muscle mass (Mamsa Dhatu)", "To eliminate Ama and kindle the digestive fire", "To provide deep rejuvenation (Rasayana)", "To perform a full Panchakarma cleanse"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deepana (kindling Agni) and Pachana (digesting Ama) is the essential first phase to ensure that subsequent treatments or herbs are actually absorbed and metabolized."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "When designing a Seasonal Roadmap (L3), how many days are traditionally allocated for 'Ritu Sandhi' (the seasonal junction)?",
            "options": ["3 days total", "7 days total", "14 days total (7 at the end of the old season, 7 at the start of the new)", "30 days total"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ritu Sandhi is the 14-day transition period (7 days of the departing season and 7 days of the arriving season) where the practitioner must gradually transition the client's diet and lifestyle."

        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "In Therapeutic Meal Planning (L4), 'Viruddha Ahara' refers to incompatible food combinations. Which of the following is a classic example of Viruddha Ahara?",
            "options": ["Rice and Mung Dal", "Milk and Sour Fruits", "Ghee and Honey in unequal proportions", "Ginger and Lemon"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Milk combined with sour fruits (like citrus or berries) is a primary example of Viruddha Ahara, as it curdles the milk in the GI tract and creates Ama."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "When formulating an advanced herbal protocol (L5), what is the primary role of the 'Anupana'?",
            "options": ["To preserve the shelf life of the herbs", "To act as a vehicle that carries the herbs to specific tissues and enhances absorption", "To mask the bitter taste of the formula", "To increase the bulk of the powder"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Anupana (vehicle) is critical in L5 strategies; for example, using ghee to carry herbs to the Majja Dhatu (nervous system) or honey for the respiratory system."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "According to Dinacharya principles (L6), what is the optimal time for vigorous exercise (Vyayama) to align with the body's natural strength?",
            "options": ["During the Vata time (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM)", "During the Pitta time (10:00 AM - 2:00 PM)", "During the Kapha time (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM)", "Right before sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Kapha period (6-10 AM) is the time of maximum physical stability and strength, making it the ideal time for exercise to avoid overtaxing the nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "A client is struggling with compliance due to a 'Vata-type' scattered mind. Which behavioral coaching strategy (L7) is most effective?",
            "options": ["Giving them a 20-page manual of all possible changes", "Implementing 'Micro-Habits'—one small, non-negotiable change at a time", "Strict disciplinary measures and daily check-ins", "Telling them to wait until they feel more motivated"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For Vata-type clients, over-complication leads to paralysis. Micro-habits reduce the cognitive load and help build the consistency that Vata lacks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "In Program Packaging (L8), why is a 'Results-Based Package' (e.g., a 12-week Digestive Reset) usually superior to 'Pay-Per-Session' models?",
            "options": ["It allows the practitioner to charge more money for less work", "It ensures the client commits to the full Samprapti-reversal process, increasing success rates", "It is easier to track taxes", "It requires less clinical documentation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ayurvedic healing takes time (Dhatu transformation cycles). Packaging the service ensures the client stays for the duration required to see actual clinical results, rather than quitting when symptoms first fluctuate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "In L2 (Agni Protocols), if a client presents with 'Tikshnagni' (sharp, hyperactive fire), which herbal action is prioritized?",
            "options": ["Deepana (Stimulating)", "Pachana (Digesting)", "Samana (Balancing/Cooling)", "Lekhana (Scraping)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tikshnagni (Pitta-type) requires Samana (balancing) and cooling actions to prevent the 'fire' from burning the body's Ojas and tissues, unlike Mandagni which requires Deepana."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "Which statistic from the Behavioral Coaching lesson (L7) highlights the importance of practitioner support in habit formation?",
            "options": ["90% of people change within 2 days", "Clients with weekly accountability are 65-95% more likely to reach their goals than those without", "Only 5% of people can follow an Ayurvedic diet", "Herbs work 100% of the time regardless of lifestyle"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data shows that accountability and coaching (L7) are the primary drivers of long-term success, with structured support increasing goal attainment to the 65-95% range."
