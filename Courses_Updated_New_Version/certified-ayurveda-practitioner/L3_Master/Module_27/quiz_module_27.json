            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ayurveda describes the 'four-fold' requirements for healthy conception: Ritu (proper timing/ovulation), Kshetra (a healthy uterus), Ambu (adequate nutrition/hormones), and Bija (healthy sperm and ovum)."

            "question": "A 72-year-old client presents with Vata-type depletion, including dry skin, mild cognitive decline, and joint stiffness. Which type of Rasayana focuses on behavioral and ethical conduct rather than herbal formulas?",

                "Naimittika Rasayana"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "In the management of autoimmune disorders like Amavata (Rheumatoid Arthritis), why is the administration of heavy, nutritive oils (Snehana) often contraindicated in the initial acute phase?",
            "options": [
                "Oils increase Vata in the joints",
                "Oils can further block the Srotas (channels) already obstructed by Ama",
                "Oils decrease the potency of Ojas",
                "Oils interfere with the absorption of Guggulu"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune conditions involving 'Ama' (toxins), the primary pathology is obstruction. Applying heavy oils initially can 'lock' the Ama into the tissues. Treatment must first focus on Langhana (lightening) and Deepana-Pachana (kindling digestion) to clear Ama."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In Sthaulya (obesity), there is an over-accumulation of Medas Dhatu (fat). This excess fat creates an 'obstructive' effect in the Srotas, preventing nutrients from reaching and nourishing the deeper tissues like bone and marrow."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to Sushruta, the second layer, Lohita (associated with blood), is the site where conditions like Vyangya (hyperpigmentation) and Nyachcha (moles) manifest."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lekhana refers to the 'scraping' action. Herbs like Guggulu have a specific affinity for clearing excess fat (Medas) and toxins from the channels, which translates clinically to improved lipid profiles."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
