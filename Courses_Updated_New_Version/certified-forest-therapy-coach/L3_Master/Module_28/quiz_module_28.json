Which of the following best categorizes Ms. Anya's situation for forest therapy planning?",

                "A standard client, requiring basic assessment.",
                "A complex case due to multiple co-occurring factors and potential trauma history.",
                "A referral-only case, as forest therapy is unsuitable for PTSD.",
                "A simple case, as anxiety and job loss are common stressors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ms. Anya's situation is a complex case because it involves multiple co-occurring factors (anxiety, job loss) and a significant trauma history (PTSD), requiring advanced assessment, trauma-informed approaches, and careful adaptation of forest therapy practices."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed forest therapy prioritizes client choice, creating a sense of physical and emotional safety, and building trust.

            "question": "During a forest therapy session, a client suddenly experiences a severe panic attack, exhibiting hyperventilation and acute distress. As the L3 Coach, what is your immediate priority and initial action?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The immediate priority is to ensure the client's safety and help them regulate. Guiding them to a quiet space, offering grounding techniques (like focused breathing or sensory awareness), and assessing their needs are crucial first steps before considering further intervention or emergency services, unless the situation escalates rapidly."

            "explanation": "For neurodiverse clients, respecting sensory sensitivities and offering adaptable invitations is key. Providing alternatives like a solitary sit spot or allowing sensory aids (e.g., noise-canceling headphones) demonstrates understanding and promotes inclusion."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical boundaries dictate that severe mental health crises, especially involving suicidal ideation, require immediate referral to appropriate mental health professionals.

This respects their autonomy and self-regulation capacities, fostering a sense of control."
