            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A score of 2.5 on a 5-point scale suggests a moderate level of nature connectedness. This indicates a good baseline from which a client can further develop their connection through forest therapy, often leading to significant benefits."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In many contexts, including therapeutic settings, crossed arms and averted gaze are common non-verbal indicators of discomfort, defensiveness, or shyness. A coach should explore these cues further with sensitivity."
