            "question": "When conducting an advanced client assessment, a Forest Therapy Coach notices a client frequently mentioning chronic pain and difficulty with mobility. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step for comprehensive planning?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately design a program with strenuous walking invitations to improve mobility.",
                "Focus exclusively on psychological well-being, as physical issues are outside the scope of forest therapy.",
                "Inquire further about the nature of the pain, assess mobility limitations, and consider interdisciplinary collaboration with a physiotherapist or physician.",
                "Recommend the client avoid all forest therapy sessions until their physical condition improves."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced assessment requires a holistic approach. Inquiring further and considering interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for client safety and effective, comprehensive care, as physical issues can significantly impact participation and outcomes in forest therapy. Strenuous activities might be contraindicated, and ignoring physical issues is not client-centered."

            "question": "A client expresses a goal to 'feel less stressed.' Applying the principles of collaborative goal setting for L2 planning, how should a Forest Therapy Coach guide the client to refine this goal?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest a more generic goal, as 'feeling less stressed' is too broad for measurement.",
                "Help the client identify specific, measurable indicators of stress reduction, such as 'reduce perceived stress by 20% on the PSS-10 scale within 8 weeks' and 'engage in daily 15-minute mindful nature walks to improve sleep quality.'",
                "Tell the client that forest therapy can only help with physical relaxation, not mental stress.",
                "Set the goal for them, as coaches are experts in what clients need."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collaborative goal setting in L2 planning emphasizes making goals Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART), often with Nature-based and Soul-nourishing elements. Refining 'feel less stressed' into quantifiable and actionable objectives allows for clear progress monitoring and client engagement."

            "question": "For a client diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) who experiences heightened sensory sensitivity in overwhelming environments, which tailored program design element would be most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "A large group walk with frequent, energetic invitations and varied, stimulating sensory input.",
                "A solo, self-guided experience in a bustling urban park during peak hours.",
                "A small, guided session in a quiet, secluded forest area with extended sit spots and invitations focused on gentle, singular sensory experiences.",
                "A program exclusively focused on strenuous physical activity to 'burn off' anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tailoring programs for specific populations requires sensitivity. For GAD with sensory sensitivity, a quiet, controlled environment with gentle, focused invitations minimizes potential triggers and promotes a sense of safety and calm, which is paramount for therapeutic benefit. Large groups, bustling environments, or strenuous activity could exacerbate anxiety."

            "options": [
                "Provide the client with dietary advice based on general wellness principles.",
                "Advise the client to search online for nutritional information.",
                "Refer the client to a registered dietitian or medical doctor, emphasizing the importance of professional assessment for nutritional concerns.",
                "Ignore the observation, as it is not directly related to forest therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining ethical boundaries and understanding one's scope of practice is critical. Nutritional deficiencies require assessment by a qualified health professional. Referring to a registered dietitian or medical doctor ensures the client receives appropriate, expert care and supports effective interdisciplinary collaboration."

            "options": [
                "Encouraging immediate deep emotional processing during the first session.",
                "Prioritizing physical challenges to build resilience.",
                "Implementing a trauma-informed approach that emphasizes safety, choice, collaboration, trustworthiness, and empowerment.",
                "Avoiding any discussion of emotions or past experiences to prevent re-traumatization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For clients with a history of trauma, a trauma-informed approach is paramount. This involves creating a safe, predictable environment where the client has choice and control, fostering collaboration, building trust, and empowering them, rather than pushing for immediate emotional processing or physical challenges that might trigger distress."

                "Document the observation and discuss it at the next session.",
                "Immediately administer any available medication without knowing the client's medical history.",
                "Follow the established emergency protocol, which includes immediate first aid, contacting emergency services if necessary, and ensuring client safety.",
                "Tell the client to tough it out, as nature can sometimes be challenging."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Risk management and ethical considerations mandate that client safety is the top priority. In an emergency, the coach must immediately follow established protocols, provide first aid, and seek professional medical assistance as needed, not delay or disregard the situation."

                "Anticipated challenges for the next session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In SOAP notes (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), 'A' stands for Assessment. This section is where the coach analyzes the subjective and objective data to evaluate the client's progress, identify patterns, and interpret the overall status relative to the treatment goals."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "After several sessions, a client's objective physiological data (e.g., HRV improving, cortisol decreasing) indicates positive progress, but their subjective reports suggest persistent feelings of mild anxiety. According to the ROOTS framework's 'Sustained Progress' and treatment plan adaptation, what is the most appropriate next step?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the current plan unchanged, trusting the objective data more than subjective reports.",
                "Discontinue forest therapy, as the client's anxiety is not fully resolved.",
                "Adapt the treatment plan by reviewing the 'Objectives' to ensure they align with the client's current subjective experience, and potentially introduce new 'Therapeutic Interventions' or explore 'Observation' for underlying factors.",
                "Attribute the anxiety solely to external life factors and advise the client to seek unrelated therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective treatment planning and adaptation involve continuous monitoring of both objective and subjective data. Discrepancies warrant a review of the plan, potentially adjusting objectives or interventions, and further observation to address the client's evolving needs, aligning with the 'Sustained Progress' principle of ROOTS."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Quantitative outcome measures involve numerical data that can be statistically analyzed.
