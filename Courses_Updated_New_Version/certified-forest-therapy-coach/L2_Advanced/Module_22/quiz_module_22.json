            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A Forest Therapy Coach learns during a session that a participant, who is a minor, is being neglected at home. While confidentiality is paramount, which ethical principle or legal obligation takes precedence in this specific scenario?",

            "explanation": "As discussed in L3: Informed Consent, Confidentiality, and Privacy, there are clear limits to confidentiality, especially when there is a risk of harm to a minor or vulnerable person. Mandated reporting laws take precedence over general confidentiality in cases of suspected child abuse or neglect."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ensuring client safety, as covered in L4: Ensuring Client Safety and Risk Management, is paramount. Allowing a participant with a severe allergy to proceed without their life-saving medication into a known risk area is irresponsible. The coach must mitigate this risk by rescheduling or offering a safe alternative, not by relying on others or minimizing the danger."
