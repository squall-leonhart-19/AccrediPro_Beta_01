            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Advanced integration extends beyond single sessions, focusing on how clients can consistently embody and apply the insights and benefits of forest therapy into their everyday routines, fostering a sustained connection to well-being."

            "question": "A client in an advanced integration program consistently expresses feelings of overwhelm and anxiety when attempting to practice 'micro-dosing nature' in their busy urban environment. Which advanced assessment strategy would be most effective for the coach to employ in this scenario?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A detailed 'Lifestyle Audit' allows the coach to collaboratively explore the client's daily schedule, stressors, and environmental factors to pinpoint specific challenges and co-create realistic, sustainable integration strategies. This aligns with advanced customization principles."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guided journaling, especially with prompts that encourage exploring metaphor, symbolism, and emotional resonance, helps clients process their experiences deeply and weave them into their personal narratives, fostering transformative insight and meaning-making.

                "Relying solely on willpower for daily practice.",
                "Creating 'tiny habits' by linking nature connection to existing daily routines (e.g., a mindful sip of tea by a window each morning).",
                "Scheduling infrequent, but very long, immersion experiences.",
                "Ignoring daily practice and focusing only on weekly coaching calls."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creating 'tiny habits' by linking new behaviors to existing routines (e.g., 'habit stacking') is a highly effective strategy for sustained integration, as it reduces friction and leverages established neural pathways, making nature connection more accessible and consistent."

                "A mix of validated self-report scales (e.g., PANAS, SCS), qualitative narrative feedback, and behavioral observations.",
                "Solely the client's subjective opinion of 'feeling better'.",
                "Only the number of trees the client identifies during a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive evaluation utilizes both quantitative (validated self-report scales like Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) for mood, or the Connectedness to Nature Scale (SCS) for nature connection) and qualitative data (narrative feedback, journaling, behavioral observations) to capture the multifaceted impact of integrated practice."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing suicidal ideation and severe clinical symptoms falls outside the scope of practice for a Forest Therapy Coach. The ethical imperative is to immediately refer the client to qualified licensed mental health professionals and ensure they have access to appropriate crisis support."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced program design emphasizes a progressive approach. Introducing increasingly complex invitations and diverse sensory experiences, while building on prior learning and reflections, fosters deeper engagement, skill development, and sustained integration over time."

            "question": "A core principle of advanced integration involves facilitating the client's ability to engage in <span class=\"highlight\">meaning-making</span> from their forest therapy experiences. Which of the following best supports this process?",

                "Terminate the program, as the client is clearly not committed.",
                "Revisit initial goals, explore expectations, and introduce a more flexible, process-oriented tracking method (e.g., a 'Joy Journal' instead of quantitative metrics).",
                "Insist they double their practice time to see faster results.",
                "Blame the client for their lack of progress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When clients experience demotivation due to a lack of perceived results, it's crucial to revisit their original goals and expectations. Shifting from rigid quantitative metrics to a more flexible, qualitative, and process-oriented tracking method, such as a 'Joy Journal,' can help them re-engage with the intrinsic value of the practice and celebrate small, personal victories, thereby navigating demotivation."
