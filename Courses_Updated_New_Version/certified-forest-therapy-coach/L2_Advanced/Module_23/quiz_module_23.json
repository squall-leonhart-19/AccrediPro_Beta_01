            "question": "A forest therapy guide is leading an advanced session focused on interoceptive awareness. Which invitation would most effectively deepen a participant's internal bodily sensation perception beyond basic sensory input?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive awareness specifically focuses on internal bodily sensations, such as breath, heartbeat, and proprioception (sense of body in space). Option C directly addresses this deeper internal perception, which is a key aspect of advanced sensory immersion."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced group facilitation embraces diverse perspectives.
