                "Exclusive reliance on anecdotal client reports for intervention design.",
                "Integrating the best available research evidence with practitioner expertise and client values.",
                "Prioritizing only quantitative research findings over qualitative insights.",
                "Implementing interventions based solely on historical traditions, regardless of current evidence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-Based Forest Therapy is defined by the integration of the best available scientific research, the coach's practical expertise, and the client's individual preferences and values. It avoids sole reliance on any single factor."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for establishing causality because they involve random assignment to intervention and control groups, minimizing confounding variables and selection bias."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating the impact of forest therapy on cardiovascular health, involving hundreds of participants, would most likely report a statistically significant reduction in which of the following?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autonomy refers to an individual's right to make their own decisions. For vulnerable populations, ensuring fully informed consent, free from coercion and with a clear understanding of risks and benefits, is paramount to upholding their autonomy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Awe is often experienced in the presence of vastness or complexity that transcends one's current understanding. A 'sit spot' focused on grand natural elements like a vast landscape or an ancient tree is highly conducive to fostering this emotional and spiritual experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This scenario describes performance bias. When participants or researchers are aware of the intervention assignment, their behavior or reporting may change, potentially influencing the study outcomes regardless of the intervention's true effect. Blinding helps mitigate this."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "A client expresses skepticism about the scientific benefits of forest therapy, asking, 'Is there any real proof this works, or is it just a feeling?' As an informed Forest Therapy Coach, what is the most appropriate and professional response?",
            "options": [
                "'Just trust me; it works for everyone.'",
                "'While individual experiences vary, numerous peer-reviewed studies and meta-analyses support physiological and psychological benefits, such as reduced cortisol and improved mood. I can share some resources.'",
                "'It's mostly anecdotal, but many people feel better.'",
                "'The science is too complex to explain, but it's very popular.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An informed coach should be able to articulate the evidence base clearly and concisely, referencing scientific findings and offering to provide resources. This demonstrates professionalism and builds client trust through evidence-based communication."
