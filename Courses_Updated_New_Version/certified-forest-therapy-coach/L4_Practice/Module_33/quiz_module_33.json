            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The principle of non-maleficence dictates that a practitioner must 'do no harm.' In forest therapy, this extends to both the physical and psychological well-being of participants and the ecological integrity of the natural spaces used."

            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Forest Therapy Coach's duty of care involves taking reasonable steps to prevent harm to participants. This includes thorough risk assessment, implementing safety protocols, and being prepared for emergencies, as opposed to guaranteeing outcomes or providing medical advice."

            "question": "For <span class=\"highlight\">informed consent</span> to be legally and ethically valid in the context of forest therapy, which element is absolutely essential, as outlined in data privacy regulations and ethical codes?",

                "The client must make an upfront payment for the session prior to signing the consent form.",
                "The client must fully understand the nature of the activities, potential risks, benefits, and their right to withdraw, and provide consent voluntarily.",
                "The consent form must be notarized by a legal professional to be considered binding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Valid informed consent requires that the client is competent to make decisions, receives sufficient information to understand the proposed activity (including risks and benefits), and gives consent freely and voluntarily. Age of majority can vary, payment is not a condition for validity, and notarization is typically not required."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Commercial activities on public or privately managed lands almost always require formal permission, such as a permit or land use agreement, to ensure compliance with local regulations, manage impact, and establish clear terms of use. Verbal agreements are insufficient for commercial operations."

                "Suggest specific herbal remedies or dietary changes for depression, as these are natural approaches.",
                "Continue the session as planned, politely ignoring the participant's disclosure to maintain group focus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Forest Therapy Coaches operate within a specific scope of practice focused on nature connection and well-being. Providing clinical diagnosis or treatment for mental health conditions like depression is outside this scope. The ethical and professional response is to refer to appropriate licensed professionals while offering empathetic support within professional boundaries."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "International practice requires strict adherence to the laws and regulations of the host country, which can vary significantly from one's home country regarding business operations, land access, liability, and even the definition of therapeutic practices. Cultural norms also play a crucial role in ethical and respectful engagement."

            "question": "During a guided forest therapy session, a participant unexpectedly trips and sustains a minor injury (e.g., a sprained ankle). The coach, having conducted a pre-session risk assessment, immediately provides first aid, secures the area, and contacts emergency services if necessary, following their established protocols. This scenario primarily demonstrates the coach's adherence to which two crucial aspects of professional practice?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A Forest Therapy Coach is approached by a local media outlet requesting details about a high-profile client who attended a recent private group session. The coach has a signed client contract that explicitly includes a strict confidentiality clause. What is the coach's ethical and legal obligation in this situation?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a brief, anonymized statement to the media to maintain good public relations, without revealing the client's name.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary obligation is to uphold confidentiality. Even if the client might consent, the initial and default stance is to refuse disclosure. A signed confidentiality clause legally binds the coach, and ethical codes reinforce the protection of client privacy. Asking for permission is a secondary step *if* there's a compelling reason, but the immediate obligation is refusal."
