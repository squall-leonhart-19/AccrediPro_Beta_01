            "question": "A client presents with generalized anxiety and difficulty sleeping. During the initial advanced assessment, the coach identifies a strong underlying need for control and a history of perfectionism. Which aspect is MOST crucial for the coach to address first in goal alignment?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced assessment goes beyond superficial symptoms to underlying needs. Addressing the client's need for control in goal alignment allows for deeper, more sustainable change, rather than merely managing symptoms. This aligns with the comprehensive client assessment principles discussed in L2."
