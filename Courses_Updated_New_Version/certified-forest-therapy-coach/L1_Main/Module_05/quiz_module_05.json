            "question": "The <span class=\"highlight\">biophilia hypothesis</span>, a foundational concept in sustained nature connection, posits that humans have an innate tendency to connect with nature. Which of the following best describes its implication for long-term engagement?",
            "options": [
                "It suggests that nature connection is purely a learned behavior.",
                "It implies that consistent exposure can reactivate an inherent drive for nature interaction and foster deeper commitment.",
                "It states that only wilderness settings can fulfill this innate need, making urban nature ineffective.",
                "It primarily explains the physical health benefits of nature, not psychological well-being."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The biophilia hypothesis suggests that humans possess an inherent, evolutionary-based inclination to affiliate with natural systems and life forms. For sustained engagement, this implies that consistent exposure and mindful interaction can reactivate and strengthen this innate drive, leading to a deeper, more committed relationship with nature over time. It is not purely learned, nor is it limited to wilderness settings or only physical benefits."
