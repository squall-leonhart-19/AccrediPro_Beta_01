            "question": "A Forest Therapy Coach guides participants to shift from 'eagle eyes' (focused, analytical vision) to 'deer eyes' (soft, wide-angle gaze) during a visual awareness invitation. What is the primary intention behind this shift, as explored in L2, 'Guiding Visual Awareness: Seeing with New Eyes'?",
            "options": [
                "To improve participants' ability to identify specific flora and fauna for scientific classification.",
                "To expand peripheral vision and soften the gaze, allowing for a broader, less analytical, and more receptive perception of the environment.",
                "To focus intensely on a single, distant object to improve concentration and reduce distractions.",
                "To encourage participants to close their eyes and visualize the forest environment from memory."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'deer eyes' invitation encourages participants to move beyond analytical observation, widening their peripheral vision and softening their gaze. This promotes a more holistic, non-judgmental, and receptive visual experience, aligning with the principles of 'seeing with new eyes' rather than just identifying."

            "options": [
                "Immediately identify the berry using a field guide and confirm if it's edible before allowing a taste.",
                "Encourage the participant to taste a small amount to explore their gustatory senses, reminding them to spit it out if it tastes bad.",
                "Advise strongly against consuming any wild plants unless absolutely certain of identification and safety, and only if it's part of a pre-planned, expert-led foraging activity with known edible species.",
                "Suggest collecting a sample of the berry to research its edibility later, away from the group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount in Forest Therapy, especially concerning gustatory exploration. Many wild plants are toxic, and misidentification can have serious consequences. A coach must always prioritize participant safety, advising against consuming unknown wild plants. Any gustatory invitations should be pre-planned with safely identified, edible elements and led by someone with expert knowledge."
