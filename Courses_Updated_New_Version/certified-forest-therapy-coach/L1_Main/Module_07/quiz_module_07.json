            "question": "Which neurobiological mechanism is most directly associated with the immune-boosting effects observed in forest therapy, particularly concerning the inhalation of phytoncides?",
            "options": [
                "Increased salivary cortisol levels",
                "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system",
                "Enhanced Natural Killer (NK) cell activity",
                "Decreased alpha wave production in the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have consistently shown that exposure to phytoncides, volatile organic compounds emitted by trees, leads to a significant increase in the number and activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells, which are crucial for immune surveillance and anti-cancer functions."

                "Directly offering solutions or advice based on similar past clients",
                "Shifting the topic abruptly to a different nature observation to distract them",
                "Asking, 'What does 'stuck' feel like in your body, and where do you feel the 'crossroads' in this specific forest setting?'",
                "Interrupting to summarize their feelings and then immediately moving to the next invitation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This approach uses advanced narrative therapy techniques, inviting the client to embody their metaphor and connect it to their present physical and environmental experience, facilitating deeper self-awareness and potential pathways for change."

                "Providing a detailed list of common bird species and their calls to memorize",
                "Instructing them to close their eyes and focus on isolating a single, distant sound for an extended period",
                "Suggesting they try to identify the source of *any* sound they hear, no matter how faint",
                "Encouraging them to hum softly to mask distracting background noises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Closing eyes and focusing on a single, distant sound helps to reduce visual distractions and heighten auditory focus, promoting deeper sensory acuity and mindfulness. This is a core practice in 'slow looking' and mindful observation."

            "question": "During a group forest therapy session, one participant becomes visibly anxious due to an unexpected encounter with a harmless snake, causing distress to others. What is the coach's immediate and most appropriate action, as per navigating challenging client scenarios?",

                "Ignore the snake and continue the ongoing invitation to avoid drawing more attention",
                "Immediately remove the anxious participant from the forest entirely",
                "Acknowledge the fear, ensure the safety of all participants and the animal, and gently guide the group's attention back to a grounding element or a 'sit spot' away from the snake's path",
                "Scold the participant for overreacting and disrupting the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In challenging scenarios, a coach must prioritize safety, acknowledge client emotions without judgment, and then gently re-establish a sense of calm and groundedness, often by shifting focus to a safe, supportive element of the environment."

                "Insisting that clients travel to a pristine wilderness area for all sessions",
                "Focusing exclusively on indoor plant interactions and virtual nature experiences",
                "Utilizing urban parks, community gardens, street trees, or even observing the sky and immediate natural elements within a city, adapting invitations accordingly",
                "Cancelling sessions if no 'true' untouched forest environment is available"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adapting forest therapy for diverse environments involves creativity and flexibility. Urban forest therapy leverages available green spaces, no matter how small, and redefines 'nature' to include elements like street trees, sky, and urban wildlife, making connection accessible."

            "question": "A client expresses a desire to continue their forest therapy sessions with their coach in a personal social capacity outside of the professional coaching relationship.

            "options": [
                "Accept the invitation to build a stronger, more personal rapport, as it could enhance trust",
                "Decline the invitation and clearly explain the importance of maintaining professional boundaries to protect the integrity of the therapeutic space and client welfare",

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) on forest bathing indicated a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">25% reduction in salivary cortisol levels</span> after a 3-hour immersion. This physiological change primarily signifies the activation of which crucial system?",
            "options": [
                "The sympathetic nervous system (SNS)",
                "The central nervous system (CNS)",
                "The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)",
                "The endocrine stress response system (ESRS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A reduction in cortisol, the primary stress hormone, is a key indicator of decreased physiological stress. This is directly associated with the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), responsible for the 'rest and digest' response, promoting relaxation and recovery."

                "Encouraging the client to bring their phone to capture photos of interesting observations",
                "Providing a specific, complex task to complete during the sit, such as identifying 10 different plant species",
                "Guiding them to select a spot that offers a sense of refuge and encourages sustained, non-judgmental awareness of subtle sensory input for an extended period",
                "Limiting the sit spot to only 2 minutes to prevent boredom or discomfort"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a client overwhelmed by digital noise and lacking focus, a 'Sit Spot' invitation should prioritize creating a space for quiet introspection and sustained, non-judgmental sensory engagement. This helps to reset attention and cultivate inner calm, directly addressing their stated challenges."
