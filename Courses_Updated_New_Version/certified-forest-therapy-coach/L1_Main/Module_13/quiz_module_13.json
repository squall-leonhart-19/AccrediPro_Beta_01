            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reduced amygdala activity (associated with fear/stress) and increased prefrontal cortex activity (associated with executive function/calm) support the ART concept of 'Fascination.' Soft fascination in nature allows for involuntary attention, reducing the cognitive load of directed attention and facilitating mental restoration."

            "question": "During an 'Outdoor Immersion' sequence (ROOTS 'O'), a coach observes a participant becoming particularly drawn to a specific fallen log covered in moss and fungi, spending a significant amount of time observing its decomposition. To deepen this experience and facilitate emotional exploration, which invitation would be most aligned with the ROOTS framework?",
            "options": [
                "\"Please move on; we have a schedule to keep and need to cover more ground.\"",
                "\"What scientific processes do you observe happening in the log, and can you identify the species of fungus?\"",
                "\"If this log could tell a story about its journey and transformation, what might it be? What feelings or reflections arise within you as you witness this cycle of life and decay?\"",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ROOTS 'Outdoor Immersion' component encourages deeper connection and emotional processing. An invitation that uses metaphor and prompts reflection on natural cycles (life, death, transformation) directly facilitates emotional exploration and meaning-making, aligning with the core principles of forest therapy."
