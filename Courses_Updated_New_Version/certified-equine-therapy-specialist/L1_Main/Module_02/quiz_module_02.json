            "question": "Which equine somatic cue is most indicative of increased anxiety or discomfort, suggesting the horse is serving as a 'biofeedback mirror' for a client's internal state, as discussed in L1 and L3?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid tail swishing, stiff posture, and wide eyes",
                "Lowered head with soft eyes and a relaxed muzzle",
                "Ears softly turned towards the client with a relaxed neck",
                "A deep sigh followed by resting a hind leg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Rapid tail swishing, stiff posture, and wide eyes are classic signs of equine anxiety or discomfort. These subtle cues, if observed by a client, can reflect their own unacknowledged tension or emotional state, highlighting the equine's role as a biofeedback mirror."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "When guiding a client to observe an equine's response without judgment, which type of question is most effective for promoting objective awareness, as highlighted in L2?",
            "options": [
                "\"Why do you think the horse is being difficult right now?\"",
                "\"What specific physical actions or expressions do you notice in the horse at this moment?\"",
                "\"How does the horse's behavior make you feel about yourself?\"",
                "\"Is the horse behaving correctly according to its natural instincts?\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asking 'what specific physical actions or expressions do you notice?' encourages direct, non-interpretive observation, allowing the client to gather factual data about the equine's communication before processing their own internal experience. This aligns with L2's emphasis on objective observation."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client consistently struggles with a horse that seems to ignore their requests for movement, often turning its hindquarters away. The client expresses frustration, stating, 'No one ever listens to me!' From the perspective of L7, 'Exploring Relational Dynamics,' what is the most likely area of exploration for the specialist?",
            "options": [
                "The need for the client to learn more assertive horsemanship techniques.",
                "The equine's inherent stubbornness and resistance to human direction.",
                "How the client's communication patterns and relational dynamics with the horse mirror those in their human relationships.",
                "The horse's training history and previous negative experiences with humans."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L7 focuses on how client-equine interactions reflect broader relational dynamics. The client's statement 'No one ever listens to me!' strongly suggests a transference of patterns from human relationships, making this a prime area for exploring communication styles and perceived boundaries."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "After a client successfully calms a previously agitated horse by consciously slowing their own breathing and softening their body, the specialist asks, 'What did you notice in your body as you shifted your breath, and how did the horse respond?' This intervention primarily aims to cultivate what in the client, as discussed in L8?",
            "options": [
                "A cognitive understanding of equine behavior.",
                "An external locus of control regarding animal interactions.",
                "Embodied self-awareness, integrating interoception and proprioception with external feedback.",
                "Reliance on the specialist for future problem-solving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario directly supports the cultivation of embodied self-awareness (L8). By connecting internal physiological shifts (breath, body tension) with external equine feedback, the client integrates interoceptive (internal body sensations) and proprioceptive (body position) awareness, fostering a deeper mind-body connection."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "During a session, a client becomes visibly agitated, their voice rising and movements becoming abrupt. The horse responds by raising its head, tensing its body, and moving to the far side of the arena. According to L6, 'Strategies for Emotional Self-Regulation,' what is the most appropriate immediate intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Instructing the client to pursue the horse and re-establish control.",
                "Encouraging the client to pause, take three slow, deep diaphragmatic breaths, and gently place their hand on their chest or abdomen.",
                "Asking the client to intellectually analyze the horse's behavior.",
                "Immediately ending the session to prevent further escalation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L6 emphasizes immediate, practical strategies for self-regulation. Deep diaphragmatic breathing and grounding techniques (like placing a hand on the body) are primary tools to help a client downregulate their nervous system in the moment, which can then positively impact the equine's response."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client describes feeling 'off' after a session where the horse seemed unresponsive. To help the client identify and name a more specific emotional state, a specialist, referencing L5, 'Identifying and Naming Client Emotional States,' might employ which strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting a specific emotion like 'frustrated' or 'sad' for the client to confirm.",
                "Asking, 'Can you describe the physical sensations in your body when you feel 'off'? What words come to mind when you think about those sensations?'",
                "Immediately shifting focus to what the client could have done differently to elicit a response from the horse.",
                "Providing a list of common emotional terms and asking the client to pick one."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L5 encourages clients to expand their emotional vocabulary by connecting abstract feelings to concrete bodily sensations. Asking about physical sensations helps bridge the gap between vague feelings and specific emotions, fostering a deeper understanding of their internal experience."

            "question": "In a case study discussed in Module 2, 'Sarah,' a 32-year-old client with a history of insecure attachment, consistently found herself chasing a horse that would wander away. The facilitator helped Sarah connect this pattern to her tendency to 'chase' validation in her relationships. This illustrates a core principle from which lesson?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario directly aligns with L7, which focuses on exploring how client-equine interactions serve as metaphors or mirrors for broader relational dynamics and communication patterns in the client's life, particularly those related to attachment and seeking validation."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) on Equine-Assisted Services, referenced in Module 2, found that clients who were actively guided to connect equine responses to their own internal states showed a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">30% greater increase in emotional insight</span> compared to control groups. This finding most strongly supports the efficacy of which lesson's core principles?",
            "options": [
                "L1: Decoding Equine Somatic Communication",
                "L4: Facilitating Client Reflection & Processing",

                "L8: Cultivating Embodied Self-Awareness through Equine Feedback"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The statistic highlights an increase in emotional insight when clients connect equine responses to their internal states. This is the primary objective of L4, 'Facilitating Client Reflection & Processing,' which involves guiding clients to make meaning of the equine's biofeedback in relation to their own emotional and psychological experiences."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A client observes a horse yawning repeatedly and showing signs of licking and chewing after a period of tension. According to L1, 'Decoding Equine Somatic Communication,' what is the most likely interpretation of these equine behaviors?",
            "options": [
                "The horse is bored and disengaged from the interaction.",
                "The horse is experiencing digestive issues and requires veterinary attention.",
                "The horse is releasing tension and beginning to process and regulate its nervous system.",
                "The horse is subtly signaling a desire for food or treats."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Yawning, licking, and chewing are common equine signs of tension release and parasympathetic nervous system activation. These behaviors indicate that the horse is processing stress and moving towards a state of relaxation and regulation, a key aspect of decoding somatic communication from L1."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A specialist notices a client holding their breath and clenching their jaw while attempting to lead a horse. The horse responds by dragging its feet and resisting forward movement. The specialist intervenes by saying, 'Notice your breath and jaw. What happens if you intentionally soften those areas?' This intervention integrates principles primarily from which two lessons?",
            "options": [
                "L2: Guiding Client Observation and L5: Identifying and Naming Client Emotional States",
                "L3: The Equine as a Biofeedback Mirror and L6: Strategies for Emotional Self-Regulation",

                "L4: Facilitating Client Reflection & Processing and L8: Cultivating Embodied Self-Awareness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This intervention directly leverages the equine as a biofeedback mirror (L3), as the horse's resistance reflects the client's tension. The instruction to 'soften those areas' is a direct application of strategies for emotional self-regulation (L6), specifically focusing on physiological shifts to influence both the client's state and the equine's response."
