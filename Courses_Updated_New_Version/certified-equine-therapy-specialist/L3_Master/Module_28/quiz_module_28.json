            "options": [
                "Facilitate long-term therapeutic change and insight.",
                "Immediately stabilize the client, ensure safety, and mitigate acute risk.",
                "Deepen the client-equine bond through challenging activities.",
                "Explore the historical root causes of the crisis presentation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In crisis intervention, the immediate priority is always to ensure the client's safety and bring about stabilization. Long-term therapeutic goals follow once the acute crisis is managed."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "During an EAT session, a client with a documented history of impulsive self-harm and current high anxiety begins to show signs of hyperventilation and agitation, moving erratically near the horse. According to best practices for <span class=\"highlight\">risk assessment and safety planning</span> in high-acuity cases, the therapist's immediate priority should be to:",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to touch the horse to promote grounding, maintaining the planned activity.",
                "Immediately separate the client from the equine and move to a safe, quiet space for de-escalation.",
                "Ask the client to identify the specific triggers for their anxiety and agitation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client with a history of impulsive self-harm shows signs of acute dysregulation near an equine, the immediate priority is to ensure safety for both client and horse. Separating them into a controlled, safe environment allows for effective de-escalation without additional risk."

            "question": "Which of the following principles is most central to applying a <span class=\"highlight\">trauma-informed approach</span> in Equine-Assisted Therapy for clients with complex trauma, as discussed in L3?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on direct equine interaction to bypass difficult verbal processing.",
                "Prioritizing client choice, empowerment, and collaboration in all session activities and safety planning.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care emphasizes safety, trustworthiness, peer support, collaboration, empowerment, and cultural sensitivity. Prioritizing client choice and empowerment is fundamental to helping individuals regain a sense of control and agency after trauma."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client in an EAT session suddenly becomes verbally aggressive, begins pacing rapidly, and clenches their fists, indicating acute emotional dysregulation and potential escalation. Which de-escalation technique, often supported by equine presence, is generally recommended as an initial response?",
            "options": [
                "Challenging their aggressive statements directly to redirect their focus.",
                "Maintaining a calm, non-confrontational stance, validating their distress, and offering a concrete grounding exercise.",
                "Immediately removing the horse from the arena without explanation to reduce stimuli.",
                "Asking them to explain the source of their anger in detail to process it verbally."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In acute emotional dysregulation, maintaining a calm presence, validating feelings, and offering simple, concrete grounding techniques (which can involve the horse if safe) are effective initial de-escalation strategies. Direct confrontation or demanding explanations can escalate the situation."

            "question": "A client presenting with <span class=\"highlight\">disorganized attachment</span> following a significant loss might exhibit which characteristic behavior in an EAT session when processing grief?",
            "options": [
                "Consistently seeking comfort and reassurance from both the horse and therapist.",
                "Demonstrating a clear, linear progression through the stages of grief without much fluctuation.",
                "Fluctuating unpredictably between seeking connection and pushing away, often with contradictory or confusing behaviors.",
                "Expressing only anger and resentment towards the loss, without any signs of sadness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment is characterized by contradictory behaviors, where individuals simultaneously desire closeness but also fear it, often due to unresolved trauma or inconsistent caregiving. This can manifest as approaching then withdrawing, or sending mixed signals, particularly in times of distress like grief."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "An EAT therapist learns during a crisis intervention session that their client has a specific, credible plan to harm an identifiable individual.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'duty to warn' (Tarasoff ruling) mandates that therapists must break confidentiality when a client poses a serious and imminent threat of violence to an identifiable victim. This legal and ethical obligation overrides confidentiality to protect potential victims."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EAT specialists operate within their scope of practice. Clients with severe dissociation and medication needs require specialized medical and psychiatric care.

                "Standard therapeutic fatigue that resolves with a weekend break.",
                "<span class=\"highlight\">Vicarious trauma</span> or compassion fatigue, requiring targeted self-care and supervision.",
                "A need for more advanced EAT training to feel more competent.",
                "A temporary dip in professional enthusiasm, which will naturally pass."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These symptoms – emotional numbness, irritability, sleep disturbances, and intrusive thoughts related to client trauma – are classic indicators of vicarious trauma or compassion fatigue. These conditions require proactive strategies, including robust self-care, clinical supervision, and potentially personal therapy, to prevent burnout."

In the context of EAT for complex trauma, this statistic highlights the importance of:",
            "options": [
                "The therapist solely dictating safety protocols to ensure compliance and minimize risk.",
                "Collaboratively creating safety plans with the client, incorporating their preferences, strengths, and resources.",
                "Relying on the horse to intuitively guide safety measures, as they are sensitive to human emotions.",
                "Avoiding explicit safety discussions to prevent re-traumatization or increased anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Client involvement in safety planning is a core tenet of trauma-informed care and significantly increases adherence. Empowering clients to contribute to their safety plans fosters a sense of control and ownership, which is crucial for individuals with complex trauma."

            "question": "During an EAT session focused on processing the grief of losing a beloved pet, a client with a history of <span class=\"highlight\">anxious-preoccupied attachment</span> begins to show signs of intense distress, seeks constant reassurance from the therapist, and even clings to the horse's mane. The most appropriate initial intervention, while maintaining safety, would be to:",
            "options": [
                "Firmly instruct the client to stop clinging to the horse to prevent injury and promote independence.",
                "Gently validate their feelings of distress and offer a structured, contained activity with the horse that provides a sense of predictability and co-regulation.",
                "Redirect their attention to a completely different, unrelated activity to distract them from the grief.",
                "Suggest they take a break from EAT entirely, as the intensity seems too overwhelming for the modality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients with anxious-preoccupied attachment often seek intense reassurance and can become overwhelmed in distress. Validating their feelings while offering a structured, predictable activity can provide a sense of safety and containment, promoting co-regulation rather than abandonment or dismissal. Ensuring the horse's safety is always paramount, but gentle redirection is preferred over firm instruction in this context."
