            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beneficence is the ethical principle that requires practitioners to actively promote the well-being and act in the best interest of their clients, aiming to do good."

            "question": "An equine therapy specialist holds a national certification but is not a licensed mental health professional. A client presents with severe clinical depression requiring psychiatric evaluation. What is the most appropriate action for the specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Begin equine-assisted psychotherapy sessions immediately, as equine therapy is beneficial for depression.",
                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional for assessment and potential co-treatment, operating within their certification's scope.",
                "Advise the client that equine therapy can replace traditional psychiatric care.",
                "Provide medication recommendations based on observed client behavior during sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A certified specialist must operate within their defined scope of practice. Severe clinical conditions requiring psychiatric evaluation necessitate referral to a licensed mental health professional, often for co-treatment or prior assessment, to ensure the client receives appropriate care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HIPAA permits disclosures for treatment, payment, healthcare operations, and certain public interest and benefit activities (like court orders or averting threats).

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a written format is highly recommended for clarity and enforceability, not all contracts legally require a written format to be binding (e.g., verbal agreements can be binding, though harder to prove).

            "explanation": "A dual relationship occurs when a therapist has a professional relationship with a client and simultaneously has another type of relationship (social, business, familial, etc.) with the same person. It requires careful management to prevent conflicts of interest or exploitation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ADA requires covered entities to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of service animals by individuals with disabilities.

            "question": "During a casual conversation with a colleague at a professional conference, an equine therapist mentions a challenging client case, inadvertently revealing enough specific details for the colleague to identify the client. This action most directly violates which core principle?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Revealing identifiable client information, even inadvertently, constitutes a breach of client confidentiality. While it could indirectly impact professional boundaries or beneficence, the direct violation is confidentiality."

            "question": "An equine therapy practice employing multiple certified specialists and a licensed mental health professional decides to structure itself as a Limited Liability Company (LLC). What is a primary advantage of an LLC for this type of practice?",
            "options": [
                "It allows all employees to practice outside their individual scope without personal liability.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LLC is a popular business structure that provides owners with personal liability protection (shielding personal assets from business debts and legal claims) while often allowing profits and losses to be passed through to the owners' personal income without being subject to corporate tax rates. It does not permit practicing outside scope or guarantee licensing eligibility."
