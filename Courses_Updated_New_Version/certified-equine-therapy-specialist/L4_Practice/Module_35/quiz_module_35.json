            "question": "Before embarking on a significant scaling initiative, an equine therapy practice should conduct a thorough internal assessment. Which of the following is the MOST critical aspect to evaluate to determine operational readiness?",
            "options": [
                "The current color scheme of the facility's branding.",
                "The availability of a new luxury horse trailer.",
                "The existing organizational capacity, including staff skillset, operational protocols, and infrastructure.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Operational readiness is fundamentally about the internal capacity to handle increased demand and complexity. This includes human resources (staff skills), processes (protocols), and physical/technological assets (infrastructure), as discussed in L1: Assessing Readiness for Scaling."

            "id": "q35_2",
            "question": "An equine therapy practice is considering expanding its services to a new geographic region. Which expansion model would involve partnering with another organization to use their existing facilities and staff, while maintaining the original practice's brand and oversight?",
            "options": [
                "Franchising",
                "Satellite location (fully owned and operated)",

                "Digital-only service expansion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As covered in L2: Strategic Program Expansion Models, a licensing agreement allows the practice to leverage another entity's resources (facilities, staff) under its brand and protocols, without the full capital investment or operational burden of a wholly owned satellite location or the extensive legal framework of franchising."

            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "As an equine therapy practice scales, a common challenge is maintaining team cohesion and performance. To foster a high-performance growth team, what is the most effective strategy for empowering new and existing staff?",
            "options": [
                "Centralizing all decision-making to the founder to ensure consistency.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowering a growth team, as detailed in L3: Building & Empowering a High-Performance Growth Team, involves providing them with the skills (professional development), authority (delegation), and environment (psychological safety) to contribute effectively and adapt to new challenges, rather than stifling autonomy or communication."

            "id": "q35_4",
            "question": "A growing equine therapy practice identifies a need for significant capital investment to acquire additional therapy horses and expand facility infrastructure. Which funding source typically offers the most control to the practice owner but may require substantial collateral or a proven track record?",
            "options": [
                "Government grants",
                "Venture capital investment",
                "Commercial bank loan",
                "Crowdfunding campaign"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L4: Financial & Operational Scaling for Sustainability, commercial bank loans provide capital with repayment terms and interest, allowing the owner to retain full control of the business, unlike venture capital which involves equity. While grants are non-repayable, they are highly competitive and often project-specific. Crowdfunding can be successful but typically for smaller initial raises and can be unpredictable."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As detailed in L7: Diversifying Revenue Streams & Ensuring Long-Term Sustainability, offering workshops or retreats leverages existing assets (facility, horses, staff expertise) to generate additional income, aligns with the practice's mission, and caters to a related but distinct market segment, thus diversifying revenue effectively."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adaptive leadership is crucial for future-proofing, as taught in L8: Leadership in Growth & Future-Proofing the Practice. It involves anticipating changes, strategic planning, encouraging innovation, and building a resilient organization with empowered leaders capable of succession, rather than rigid adherence or micromanagement."

            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "An equine therapy practice expands to three new locations.
