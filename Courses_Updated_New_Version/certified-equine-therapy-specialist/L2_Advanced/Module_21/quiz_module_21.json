            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary distinction between the roles of the <span class=\"highlight\">Equine Professional</span> and the <span class=\"highlight\">Mental Health Professional</span> in an EAT team, as discussed in Foundational Principles?",
            "options": [
                "The Equine Professional focuses on horse welfare and safety, while the Mental Health Professional focuses on clinical interpretation and client therapeutic goals.",
                "The Equine Professional leads all mounted activities, while the Mental Health Professional exclusively conducts groundwork sessions.",
                "The Equine Professional is responsible for all session logistics, while the Mental Health Professional only observes from a distance.",
                "The Equine Professional provides direct psychotherapy, while the Mental Health Professional manages administrative tasks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Equine Professional's primary role is ensuring equine welfare, safety, and facilitating horse interactions, while the Mental Health Professional's expertise lies in clinical assessment, therapeutic interventions, and interpreting client dynamics within the EAT context. Their roles are distinct but complementary."

            "options": [
                "Client will feel less anxious during sessions.",
                "Client will complete 3 grooming sessions independently, demonstrating calm interactions, within the next 4 weeks.",

                "Client will improve their relationship with horses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A measurable goal specifies observable behaviors or quantifiable outcomes. 'Completing 3 grooming sessions independently, demonstrating calm interactions' provides clear criteria for evaluation, unlike vague statements about 'feeling less anxious' or 'understanding better'."

            "question": "In Phase 1: <span class=\"highlight\">Therapeutic Connection</span>, an EAT specialist observes a client, Sarah, consistently approaching the horse from its blind spot and startling it. Which intervention is most aligned with the goals of this initial phase?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately interpreting Sarah's behavior as a metaphor for trust issues in her personal life.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 prioritizes safety, building basic rapport with the horse, and teaching fundamental horsemanship skills. Guiding Sarah to understand horse behavior and adjust her approach directly addresses these foundational elements before deeper therapeutic processing."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client struggles with assertiveness. During a leading activity, the horse repeatedly stops or veers off path despite the client's attempts to guide it. The EAT team facilitates a discussion focusing on the client's internal experience of frustration and helplessness, and how they might apply this interaction to their daily relationships. This best aligns with which phase of the EAT treatment plan?",
            "options": [
                "Phase 1: Therapeutic Connection",
                "Phase 5: Somatic Integration",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Facilitating discussions that connect in-session experiences with broader life patterns, fostering insight and self-awareness, is a core component of the Reflection & Understanding phases (Phases 2 & 3). This moves beyond initial connection to processing and cognitive restructuring."

In the <span class=\"highlight\">Somatic & Integration</span> phases (Phases 4 & 5) of EAT, which activity would be most directly aimed at addressing these somatic symptoms and integrating new coping mechanisms?",
            "options": [
                "Journaling extensively about past traumatic events.",
                "Engaging in rhythmic grooming while focusing on breath, body sensations, and the horse's gentle movements.",

                "Learning advanced riding techniques that require complex motor skills."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic & Integration phases emphasize body awareness, emotional regulation, and transferring learned skills to daily life. Rhythmic grooming with a focus on breath and sensation directly addresses somatic symptoms, promotes grounding, and integrates mindfulness, which are critical for trauma recovery."

                "Emphasizing abstract metaphorical interpretations of horse interactions to foster creative thinking.",
                "Ensuring predictable routines, clear, concrete instructions, and providing ample processing time.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with ASD often benefit from structured environments, predictable routines, and direct, concrete communication. Providing clear instructions and allowing sufficient processing time helps reduce anxiety and enhances engagement, as supported by research in neurodevelopmental interventions."

            "question": "A client discloses sensitive information about past abuse during an EAT session. According to ethical guidelines and best practice documentation, which of the following is the most appropriate action for the EAT specialist?",

                "Record the exact, graphic details of the abuse in the client's EAT session notes to ensure thoroughness.",
                "Immediately report the information to law enforcement without consulting the client or the Mental Health Professional, assuming it's a mandatory report.",
                "Document the client's emotional state, the horse's reaction, the therapeutic intervention, and the fact that abuse was disclosed, while referring the clinical handling of the disclosure to the Mental Health Professional.",
                "Suggest the client keep this information private from other team members to protect their confidentiality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical documentation focuses on the therapeutic process and client's response, not on detailed accounts of abuse unless mandated by law or directly relevant to immediate risk (which would be handled by the MH Professional). The EAT specialist's role is to ensure safety, document the session's impact, and facilitate communication with the MH Professional for clinical follow-up and mandated reporting if applicable, maintaining client privacy within the team's scope."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "A client's initial EAT goal was to \"reduce social anxiety by initiating conversation with the EAT team during sessions.\" After 6 weeks, observation notes indicate the client still struggles with this, but has shown significant improvement in confidently leading the horse through an obstacle course and asserting boundaries with the horse. What is the most appropriate next step for the EAT team?",
            "options": [
                "Terminate treatment as the client is not meeting their primary goal.",
                "Insist the client focus solely on the initial goal, as it was established at the outset.",
                "Revise the goal to reflect progress in confidence and self-advocacy with the horse, and potentially reframe social interaction goals to leverage these new strengths.",
                "Continue with the original plan for another 6 weeks without modification, hoping for eventual breakthrough."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EAT treatment plans should be dynamic and client-centered. When a client demonstrates unexpected strengths or progress in related areas, it's crucial to acknowledge and integrate these into the plan. Revising goals to reflect actual progress and leveraging new skills can enhance motivation and therapeutic effectiveness, aligning with the principles of ongoing review and adjustment."

            "question": "During the initial assessment for EAT, a 14-year-old client, Alex, frequently avoids eye contact, speaks softly, and expresses feelings of helplessness related to school bullying. Which EAT goal is most appropriately tailored to address Alex's presenting issues, while being <span class=\"highlight\">Specific</span> and <span class=\"highlight\">Achievable</span> within EAT?",
            "options": [
                "Alex will overcome all feelings of helplessness within the next month.",
                "Alex will learn to ride a horse independently within three sessions.",
                "Alex will demonstrate increased self-advocacy by verbally communicating a boundary to the horse during two separate leading activities by the end of the month.",
                "Alex will eliminate all instances of bullying at school by participating in EAT."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This goal is specific ('verbally communicating a boundary to the horse'), measurable ('during two separate leading activities'), achievable within the EAT context, relevant to Alex's issue of helplessness/assertiveness, and time-bound ('by the end of the month'). The other options are either too broad, unrealistic, or outside the direct scope of EAT."

            "question": "According to AccrediPro standards for EAT, if an Equine Professional observes a client experiencing significant emotional distress during a session, but the Mental Health Professional is momentarily absent, the Equine Professional should prioritize:",
            "options": [
                "Immediately attempting to provide psychotherapy to the client to alleviate distress.",
                "Continuing the planned horse activity to distract the client from their emotional state.",
                "Ensuring the client's physical and emotional safety, providing comfort within their scope, and promptly communicating the observation to the Mental Health Professional upon their return.",
                "Documenting the incident and waiting until the next scheduled team meeting to discuss it, to avoid interrupting the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Equine Professional's primary responsibility in such a situation is client safety and well-being. Providing comfort and ensuring safety are within their scope, but clinical interpretation and therapeutic intervention for significant emotional distress fall under the Mental Health Professional's expertise. Prompt communication ensures appropriate follow-up."
