            "options": [
                "Only peer-reviewed research findings.",
                "Clinical expertise, client values, and the best available research evidence.",
                "Client preferences and practitioner experience exclusively.",
                "Tradition and anecdotal observations from senior practitioners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBP is a tripartite model that integrates the best available research evidence with the practitioner's clinical expertise and the client's values and preferences to make informed decisions about care."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In EAT research, which foundational methodology is considered the 'gold standard' for establishing cause-and-effect relationships due to its ability to control for confounding variables through randomization?",
            "options": [
                "Case study research.",
                "Qualitative phenomenological studies.",
                "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).",
                "Cross-sectional surveys."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are widely considered the gold standard for establishing causality because randomization helps ensure that groups are comparable, minimizing bias and strengthening the internal validity of findings."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of EAT for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consistently shows significant reductions in symptom severity across multiple studies. Which type of outcome measure would most likely be used to quantify this symptom reduction?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standardized self-report scales like the PCL-5 are commonly used and validated instruments for measuring PTSD symptom severity, making them appropriate for quantifying reductions in research studies."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Salivary cortisol is a widely recognized biomarker for stress, reflecting activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and is used to assess physiological stress or arousal in research."

            "options": [
                "The results are both statistically and clinically highly significant.",
                "The results are statistically significant, but the effect size indicates a small practical impact.",
                "The results are not statistically significant, but the effect size is large.",
                "The p-value is irrelevant without a confidence interval."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.03 is less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance. However, a Cohen's d of 0.2 is generally considered a small effect size, suggesting that while the effect is likely real, its practical or clinical impact may be limited."

            "question": "When critically appraising an EAT study, identifying a <span class=\"highlight\">lack of blinding</span> for both participants and therapists is crucial. This methodological flaw primarily increases the risk of which type of bias?",

                "Selection bias.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lack of blinding can lead to performance bias (participants/therapists behaving differently due to knowledge of group assignment) and detection bias (outcome assessors being influenced by knowledge of group assignment), both of which can distort results."

            "question": "A Certified Equine Therapy Specialist™ is working with a client who prefers a specific EAT approach not extensively supported by current research, but aligns with their cultural values. According to EBP principles, what is the most appropriate action for the specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Disregard the client's preference and strictly adhere to the most researched intervention.",

                "Refer the client to another specialist who exclusively uses that specific approach.",
                "Only use interventions with strong Level 1 evidence, regardless of client values."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBP emphasizes integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise AND client values and preferences. The specialist should educate the client, then collaborate to find an approach that respects their values while still being informed by evidence and professional judgment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To strengthen the evidence base and advocate for broader acceptance, EAT research needs more rigorous, large-scale RCTs, often involving multiple sites and diverse populations, along with cost-effectiveness studies to demonstrate economic value."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "When interpreting the results of an EAT study, a <span class=\"highlight\">confidence interval (CI)</span> for an effect size provides crucial information beyond just the p-value. What does a 95% CI of [0.8, 1.2] for a mean difference indicate?",
            "options": [
                "There is a 95% chance that the true mean difference is exactly 1.0.",
                "We are 95% confident that the true mean difference in the population lies between 0.8 and 1.2.",
                "The study had a 95% power to detect a significant difference.",
                "The mean difference is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 95% confidence interval means that if the study were repeated many times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true population parameter. Therefore, we are 95% confident that the true mean difference in the population falls within the calculated range."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selecting participants based on prior positive responses to animals introduces selection bias and significantly limits the generalizability (external validity) of the findings to a broader population, as the results may not apply to individuals without such prior positive experiences."
