            "question": "In the Functional Medicine 'Reveal' phase, what is the primary distinction between an 'Antecedent' and a 'Trigger'?",
            "options": [
                "Antecedents are biochemical mediators, while triggers are genetic predispositions.",
                "Antecedents predate the illness and set the stage, while triggers are the discrete events that initiate symptoms.",
                "Antecedents are environmental exposures, while triggers are purely psychological stressors.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms describe the root cause of a patient's chief complaint."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antecedents are factors (genetic or acquired) that predispose an individual to an illness, such as family history or early childhood trauma. Triggers are the specific 'tipping point' events, like an infection or a major life stressor, that provoke the onset of symptoms."

            "question": "A patient completes the Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) and receives a total score of 124. How should a Functional Medicine practitioner interpret this result?",
            "options": [
                "Low priority; the patient is likely healthy with minor lifestyle imbalances.",
                "Moderate toxic burden; the patient requires basic nutritional support.",
                "High toxic burden; this score indicates significant systemic dysfunction and a high 'Total Load'.",
                "The score is invalid as the MSQ is only used for digestive complaints."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional interpretation, an MSQ score over 100 is considered 'Severe' and indicates a high total toxic burden and significant systemic dysfunction requiring comprehensive intervention."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When mapping a Clinical Chronology (Timeline), which period of a patient's life is often most overlooked but provides critical data on 'Antecedents'?",
            "options": [
                "The 12 months immediately preceding the chief complaint.",
                "The geriatric years and late-stage adulthood.",
                "The preconception, prenatal, and neonatal periods.",
                "The period of highest professional productivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Reveal' phase emphasizes that antecedents often begin at or before birth, including maternal health during pregnancy, mode of delivery (C-section vs. vaginal), and early childhood antibiotic use."

            "id": "q1_4",

            "options": [
                "The patient is exposed to a single, high-dose toxic event.",
                "The 'Total Toxic Burden' exceeds the individual's unique capacity to detoxify and eliminate.",
                "The patient consumes more than 3,000 calories per day.",
                "Genetics account for 100% of the toxic accumulation regardless of lifestyle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Bucket Theory' posits that symptoms arise when the cumulative load of stressors (toxins, pathogens, stress) overflows the body's homeostatic and detoxification capacities."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "During a functional physical exam, you observe 'Angular Cheilitis' (cracks at the corners of the mouth). Which nutrient deficiencies should you investigate first?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C and Vitamin E",
                "B-vitamins (especially B2, B3, B6, B12) and Iron",

                "Vitamin D and Vitamin K2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Angular cheilitis is a classic clinical clue for deficiencies in the B-vitamin complex or iron, often linked to malabsorption or poor dietary intake."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "How does a 'Functional Range' for laboratory markers differ from a 'Pathological Range'?",
            "options": [
                "Functional ranges are wider to include more of the population.",
                "Pathological ranges are used to diagnose disease; functional ranges are used to assess optimal physiological health.",
                "Functional ranges are only used for stool and saliva testing.",
                "There is no difference; all labs use the same reference intervals based on the 'normal' population."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pathological ranges are designed to identify 95% of the 'normal' population (who may still be sub-clinically ill). Functional ranges are narrower and target the levels associated with optimal organ function and vitality."

            "options": [
                "A complete deletion of a chromosome.",
                "A variation in a single DNA building block that can influence enzyme function and disease risk.",
                "A type of virus that alters human DNA permanently.",
                "The process by which DNA is converted into protein."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A SNP is the most common type of genetic variation among people, representing a difference in a single nucleotide. While not diagnostic of disease, SNPs can alter the efficiency of biochemical pathways (e.g., MTHFR)."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A patient presents with a TSH of 3.8 uIU/mL. The standard lab range is 0.45–4.5 uIU/mL. How would a Functional Practitioner interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "Perfectly normal; no further thyroid investigation is needed.",
                "Overt Hypothyroidism; immediate high-dose T4 medication is required.",
                "Sub-optimal; the functional range is typically 1.0–2.0 uIU/mL, suggesting possible thyroid sluggishness.",
                "Hyperthyroidism; the TSH is too high for the body to manage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 3.8 is within the 'normal' pathological range, the functional range for TSH is generally 1.0–2.0 uIU/mL. A level of 3.8 suggests the pituitary is working harder to signal the thyroid, indicating sub-optimal function."

                "A gluten-free diet.",

                "A family history of Type 2 Diabetes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mediators are factors—biochemical or psychosocial—that contribute to pathological changes and keep the 'fire' of the disease process going (e.g., cytokines, free radicals, or persistent negative thoughts)."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "According to research on the 'Exposome,' approximately what percentage of chronic disease is driven by environmental and lifestyle factors rather than pure genetics?",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",
                "30-40%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Large-scale studies, including those on identical twins, suggest that 70-90% of chronic disease risk is determined by the exposome (environmental exposures and lifestyle) rather than the genome (genetics)."
