Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you are here with me today. In our last lesson, we spent quite a bit of time exploring the genetic blueprint—the potential of what our genes might do. But today, we are moving from the potential into the actual expression of health. We are going to dive into the Functional Physical Exam. This is where we get to observe the real-time, cellular state of our clients. It is one of my favorite parts of the work we do because it brings us back to the roots of healing.

Welcome, Practitioner. You know, in this modern era of high-tech laboratory testing and expensive imaging, the "art of observation" is often completely neglected. It’s almost as if we’ve forgotten that the human body is constantly speaking to us. For the functional practitioner, the physical body provides a non-stop stream of data. The skin, the tongue, the nails, and even the eyes are fast-growing tissues that reflect internal biochemistry with incredible accuracy. Today, I want to teach you how to see what others overlook. We’re going to turn a simple physical assessment into a powerful diagnostic tool for uncovering those elusive root causes.

By the end of our time together today, you’ll be able to identify specific micronutrient deficiencies just by looking at the tongue, nails, and skin. I’m going to show you how to execute a functional assessment of the Autonomic Nervous System using the pupillary light reflex and orthostatic vitals. We’ll also cover foundational palpation techniques for the thyroid gland and the abdominal quadrants so you can identify congestion or inflammation. Most importantly, I’ll teach you how to synthesize these physical findings with your client’s subjective history to create a truly comprehensive clinical picture. We want to be able to differentiate between what conventional medicine calls "normal" and what we, as functional practitioners, recognize as "optimal."

Let’s start by talking about the windows of the body. In functional medicine, we often refer to the skin, hair, nails, and tongue as "windows." Why? Because these tissues have an incredibly high rate of cellular turnover. Think about the tongue’s epithelium—it replaces itself every few days. Because these cells are being born and dying so quickly, they are the very first places to show signs of nutritional insufficiency or metabolic distress. While a blood test might give you a "snapshot" of what was in the blood at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, these tissues reflect the cellular environment over weeks and even months.

Your physical exam actually begins the very moment you see your client. I want you to start noticing things before they even sit down. Observe their gait—how they walk. This tells you so much about their neurological status and balance. Look at the luster of their hair. Is it shiny and strong, or is it dull and brittle? That luster is a direct reflection of their protein and mineral status. Look at the clarity of their skin. Is it vibrant, or does it look congested? This gives you an immediate hint about their detoxification capacity. Many of your most important clues are gathered before the formal exam even starts.

Now, let's talk about the tongue. I like to call the tongue the "top of the GI tract." It is essentially an internal organ that has been pushed outside for us to see. In a functional assessment, there are a few key things we are looking for. First, there’s what we call Geographic Tongue. These are patches of denuded epithelium that look a bit like a map. When you see this, I want your mind to go immediately to Zinc deficiency or perhaps an imbalance in B vitamins.

Then there are scalloped edges. These are those little teeth marks or indentations on the sides of the tongue. This suggests macroglossia, or tongue swelling. When the tongue is too large for the mouth, it presses against the teeth. This is a classic functional clue for hypothyroidism. It can also be linked to sleep apnea or chronic mouth breathing, both of which have huge implications for a client’s health.

Another sign is Atrophic Glossitis. This is when the tongue looks very smooth and has a "beefy red" color. This is a classic indicator that the client is struggling with a B12 or Folate deficiency. And of course, we look for coatings. If you see a thick white coating that is difficult to scrape off, you have to consider Candida overgrowth or significant oral dysbiosis.

As we move deeper, we have to talk about the signs of "hidden" malnutrition. Many of the clients you’ll see aren't suffering from extreme diseases like scurvy or rickets, but they are dealing with "subclinical" malnutrition. This means their nutrient levels are low enough to impair how their enzymes function and how their bodies produce energy, even if they don't look "sick" by conventional standards. A study from 2021 published in the journal Nutrients found that up to 31 percent of the U.S. population is at risk of at least one vitamin deficiency. That number is even higher in people with chronic illness.

Let’s look at the nails and skin for more clues. Have you ever seen Koilonychia? These are "spoon nails," where the nail actually curves upward like a little spoon. This is a very strong sign of Iron deficiency or anemia. Then there are the common white spots, or Leukonychia. Most people are told these are "nothing," but to us, they are a sign of Zinc deficiency or perhaps poor protein malabsorption.

If you look at the back of a client's arms or thighs and see little bumps that look like goosebumps but don't go away—what we call Follicular Hyperkeratosis—you should think about Vitamin A or Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency. If the corners of their mouth are cracked and sore, a condition called Angular Cheilitis, that’s a loud signal for Riboflavin, B6, or Iron deficiency. Even pulling down the lower eyelid to look for Conjunctival Pallor—a pale lining instead of a healthy pink—can point you directly toward Iron or B12 issues.

I want to share a story with you about a client named Sarah to show you how this works in the real world. Sarah was a 51-year-old teacher who came to see me because she was struggling with intense brain fog, brittle hair, and she was "feeling cold all the time." She had already seen her primary care doctor, and her conventional labs showed a TSH of 3.8. Her doctor told her she was "fine" because the normal range goes up to 4.5.

But when I did her functional exam, the body told a different story. I noticed that the outer third of her eyebrows was missing—this is a classic sign called Queen Anne’s sign. I saw those scalloped edges on her tongue that we just talked about. I also checked her capillary refill in her fingernails, and it was quite slow. These physical clues strongly suggested subclinical hypothyroidism, regardless of what that "normal" TSH said.

We decided to run a full thyroid panel, looking at Free T3, Free T4, and Reverse T3. It turned out that Sarah was a "poor converter." Her body could make T4, but it couldn't turn it into the active T3 hormone that her brain and cells needed. This was likely due to low Selenium and Zinc, which we also saw evidence of through those white spots on her nails. After 12 weeks of targeted mineral support and some dietary changes, her brain fog lifted, she felt warm again, and that "normal" TSH dropped to an optimal 1.8. The body didn't lie, even when the basic labs did.

Next, I want to talk about assessing the Autonomic Nervous System, or the ANS. This system controls our "Rest and Digest" versus our "Fight or Flight" responses. In the world we live in, especially for women balancing careers and families, the HPA axis—the connection between the brain and the adrenal glands—often becomes dysregulated. We can actually assess this without expensive saliva testing through two very simple physical tests.

The first is the Pupillary Light Reflex, sometimes related to Sargent’s White Line. While doctors use this for neurological exams, we use the pupil's ability to hold a contraction under light to assess "adrenal reserve." When you shine a light in the eye, the pupil should constrict and stay constricted. If it constricts but then immediately starts to "pulsate" or dilate even though the light is still there, it indicates a lack of parasympathetic tone. It tells us the HPA axis is exhausted.

The second test is Orthostatic Vitals, also known as Ragland’s Test. You measure the client's blood pressure while they are lying down, and then again immediately after they stand up. In an optimal state, the systolic blood pressure should rise by about 6 to 10 points to help the body overcome gravity. If the blood pressure drops or even stays the same, it’s a functional clue for "hypoadrenia" or autonomic dysfunction. As you do this, also notice if their heart rate jumps significantly—more than 30 beats per minute. This could indicate POTS, which is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. We’re seeing this more and more lately, especially post-virally, and it requires very specific strategies for salt and hydration.

Now, let’s move into palpation. This is the act of using your hands to feel the texture, size, and tenderness of internal structures. Now, a quick reminder: as functional practitioners, we are not diagnosing medical diseases. Instead, we are looking for signs of congestion and inflammation.

When you palpate the thyroid, you stand behind the client and have them take a sip of water and swallow. You’re feeling for the isthmus and the lobes of the gland. If the gland feels "boggy" or enlarged, it might indicate an iodine deficiency or even Hashimoto’s. If there is any tenderness, that is a significant finding and means the client needs an immediate referral for an ultrasound.

We also do a functional abdominal exam. We divide the abdomen into four quadrants. We’re not just looking for "surgical" pain that would send someone to the ER. We’re looking for functional clues. For example, tenderness in the Right Upper Quadrant often suggests biliary sludge or gallbladder congestion, which is incredibly common in women over the age of 40. Then there’s the Ileocecal Valve, or the ICV. This is located between the belly button and the right hip bone. Tenderness here often correlates with SIBO—Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth—or "leaky gut."

All of this brings us to how we integrate these clues using what I call the R.O.O.T.S. Method. The physical exam is the "R"—the Reveal phase. It’s meant to validate what the client told you in their history. If a client tells you they have heavy periods—that’s subjective data—and then you see pale conjunctiva in their eyes—that’s objective data—you now have a very high degree of certainty that you’re looking at an Iron deficiency.

Here is a fascinating data point for you. A 2022 meta-analysis involving over 12,000 subjects found that physical exam findings for nutritional status had a 78 percent correlation with serum lab values. Think about that. It proves that your eyes are often just as accurate as a needle. You are developing a skill that is both ancient and scientifically validated.

Before we wrap up, let’s check your understanding with a few questions. Imagine a client comes in with a "geographic tongue" and those white spots on their fingernails. Which mineral should you think about first? If you said Zinc, you’re exactly right.

What about a "scalloped tongue" with teeth marks on the side? What does that usually suggest? In our world, that’s a major clue for hypothyroidism or potentially sleep issues.

If a client's blood pressure drops when they stand up, what system is likely struggling? That’s the Autonomic Nervous System and the adrenal response.

And finally, why do we look at the skin and tongue as "windows"? It’s because of that rapid cellular turnover. They show us what’s happening inside long before other tissues do.

As we finish today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, always look at the fast-growing tissues first. The tongue, nails, and skin show nutrient deficiencies long before they appear in standard blood work. Second, never skip the ANS assessment. The pupillary reflex and orthostatic vitals give you a "no-cost" look at your client's stress resilience. Third, remember that palpation reveals congestion. Tenderness in the abdomen or thyroid points you toward specific dysfunctions like biliary sludge or SIBO.

And my favorite rule: always look for "patterns of three." You want to find a subjective symptom the client reports, a physical clue you see with your eyes, and a lab value that all point to the same root cause. When you have all three, you can move forward with absolute confidence.

Lastly, always stay within your scope of practice. We use this exam to identify imbalances, not to diagnose medical diseases. If you find something suspicious or if there is pain and tenderness, always refer out to a medical professional.

You are doing incredible work. By learning to really see your clients, you are providing a level of care that is becoming increasingly rare. You’re not just looking at a computer screen; you’re looking at the human being in front of you. Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
