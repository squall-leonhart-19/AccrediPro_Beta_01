Hi, it is Sarah here. I am so glad you have joined me for this session. We are stepping into a very special part of your journey today. In our last module, we laid the groundwork with the R.O.O.T.S. Method. Now, we are officially entering the first and perhaps the most critical stage of the entire process. We call this the Reveal Phase. This is where your work as a clinical detective truly begins. 

I want you to take a deep breath and settle in, because the Reveal Phase is about so much more than just collecting data or checking off boxes on an intake form. It is a sacred process. It is the moment where you begin to uncover the real story behind the symptoms. For many of you, especially the women here who are transitioning into this career from other fields, your natural empathy and your own life experiences are going to be your greatest clinical tools. In this lesson, we are going to move far beyond the limitations of what I call naming and blaming diseases. We are going to learn how to see the intricate, beautiful, and sometimes messy web of physiological dysfunction that always precedes a medical diagnosis.

Our goal today is to really analyze the fundamental differences between the standard diagnostic model we see in conventional medicine and the root cause investigation model we use here. I want to show you how to establish what we call a therapeutic partnership. This is built through active listening and something called narrative medicine. We are going to identify the three pillars of reveal, which are clinical history, environmental triggers, and genetic predispositions. We are also going to reframe the chief complaint. Instead of seeing it as an isolated problem to be fixed, we are going to see it as a systemic signal. Finally, I want to help you adopt a mechanism-first mindset. This is where you stop asking what is wrong and you start asking why it is happening.

Let’s start by talking about the ICD-10 paradigm shift. In the world of conventional medicine, the goal of the very first encounter with a patient is often to find a code. We call this the ICD-10 code, which stands for the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. You have probably seen these on your own insurance forms. Maybe it is M54.5 for low back pain or E11.9 for type two diabetes. Once a code is assigned, the clinical path is largely predetermined. There are standardized protocols, specific drugs for specific codes, and a very linear way of thinking. 

Now, I want to be clear that this system is very efficient for insurance billing and it is actually quite good for acute care, like if you break an arm or have a sudden infection. But for chronic illness, this model is fundamentally flawed. In functional medicine, we view the diagnosis as the starting point, not the destination. We are shifting away from that name it, blame it, and tame it approach. Instead, we use a reveal, resolve, and restore approach. 

As a practitioner, you have to realize that you aren't just selling health advice. You are selling clarity. Think about the clients you will work with. Many of them have spent years collecting these ICD-10 codes. They have a diagnosis for their thyroid, another for their joints, and another for their mood. But they never understand why they are sick in the first place. When you can sit down with a woman and explain the actual biological mechanism behind her brain fog or her exhaustion, you establish immediate authority. You build a level of trust that most doctors never achieve because you are finally giving her an answer that makes sense.

In our model, the primary goal is the mechanism, not just the label. Our time frame isn't just focused on the current symptoms from the last week; we are looking at a timeline that stretches from birth to the present moment. In the conventional world, the patient is often a passive recipient of a treatment. They sit there, they get a prescription, and they leave. But in the reveal phase, the patient is an active partner in discovery. We aren't just looking for disease through specialized testing; we are looking for dysfunction through functional testing.

This leads us into the concept of the therapeutic partnership. This is where the magic really happens. You might have seen the research from the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that the average primary care visit lasts only about seventeen minutes. In that tiny window of time, there is no room for a story. But the reveal phase honors the patient’s narrative. We use narrative medicine to allow the client to feel heard, often for the very first time in their entire medical journey.

I cannot stress this enough: active listening is not a soft skill. It is a diagnostic requirement. Research actually shows that up to eighty percent of a diagnosis can be made from the clinical history alone. That is before you ever order a single lab test. When you ask a client, what was happening in your life when these symptoms started, you are opening a door. You often find the environmental or emotional triggers that set the pathology in motion years ago.

Let me tell you about a client named Sarah to show you what I mean. Sarah came in with what her doctors called unexplained fatigue. She had been told her labs were normal and that she was probably just stressed or getting older. During the reveal phase, her practitioner didn't just look at her current fatigue. They looked at her timeline. They discovered that her symptoms began exactly three months after a very severe bout of food poisoning, which happened right in the middle of a high-stress divorce. 

That piece of information changed everything. It revealed a gut-brain-adrenal connection that a standard blood test would never have picked up. By identifying the trigger, which was the food poisoning, and the mediator, which was the chronic stress of the divorce, the practitioner could design a targeted intervention. Sarah didn’t just get better; she transitioned her health so successfully that she actually became a functional practitioner herself. Today, she earns one hundred and eighty dollars an hour helping other women in high-stress careers. That is the power of the reveal phase. It changes lives, and it changes careers.

To do this work systematically, we look through three primary lenses. We call these the three pillars of reveal. The first is the clinical history, or what we call the timeline. We are looking for three things here: antecedents, triggers, and mediators. Antecedents are the factors that predispose someone to a condition, like their birth history or family tendencies. Triggers are the events that provoke the onset of symptoms, like an infection or a trauma. Mediators are the factors that keep the symptoms going, like poor sleep or ongoing nutritional deficiencies.

The second pillar is environmental triggers. This includes what scientists call the exposome. This is the sum total of everything we are exposed to: our diet, environmental toxins, infections, and even emotional trauma. A major meta-analysis from 2023 involving over twelve thousand people found that environmental factors contribute to over seventy percent of chronic disease expression. That is a staggering number. It means that the vast majority of what our clients are dealing with is driven by their environment.

The third pillar is genetic predispositions. We have to be careful here. We don't view genes as destiny. Instead, we view them as vulnerabilities. You have probably heard the saying that your genes load the gun, but the environment pulls the trigger. By understanding a client’s genetic tendencies, we can help them modify their environment so those genes never have to be expressed as disease.

I want to give you a quick tip here as a coach. Many of the clients you will work with, especially women over forty, have been gaslit by the medical system for years. They have been told their symptoms are in their head or that they just need to lose weight. Simply saying the words, I believe you, and we are going to find out why this is happening, is often the most therapeutic part of the entire reveal phase. Never underestimate the power of validation.

Now, let’s talk about the chief complaint. In the reveal phase, we treat the chief complaint—whether it is migraines, skin rashes, or joint pain—as the smoke, not the fire. The complaint is just a gateway. It is our entry point to explore systemic physiological dysfunction. 

Take migraines as an example. A migraine is rarely just a head problem. It is usually the surface expression of something much deeper. It could be mitochondrial dysfunction, where the cells aren't producing energy correctly. It could be hormonal fluctuations, like estrogen dominance or a lack of progesterone. It could be gut permeability, often called leaky gut, which leads to systemic inflammation. Or it could be something as simple as a magnesium deficiency, which affects up to fifty percent of people in the United States. By the time you finish the reveal phase with a client, you should be able to connect the dots. You should be able to show them how the smoke of their migraine is being caused by the fire of these underlying imbalances.

This requires a profound shift in your mindset. This is the most important change you will make during this certification. You have to move from a what mindset to a why mindset. A what mindset asks, what drug or what supplement do I give for this symptom? It is a search for a quick fix. But a why mindset asks, why is the body producing this symptom in the first place? What is the underlying mechanism that has gone off track?

When you work with this level of precision, you aren't just another health coach. You are a specialist. This is why clients are willing to pay a premium, often nine hundred and ninety-seven dollars or more for a three-month program. They pay for it because they feel you are investigating their health with the precision of a scientist and the heart of a healer. My advice to you is to never rush this phase. The reveal phase is the foundation of everything that follows. If you get the reveal right, the rest of the clinical process becomes much clearer.

Let’s take a moment to check your understanding of what we have covered so far. Think about why an ICD-10 code is often not enough to resolve a chronic illness. Remember that it is just a label; it doesn't explain the cause. Think about the percentage of a diagnosis that comes from the clinical history. It is eighty percent. That is why we spend so much time listening. Recall the three pillars we discussed: the clinical history and timeline, the environmental triggers, and the genetic predispositions. And finally, remember how to view that chief complaint. It is the gateway or the smoke that leads us to the fire.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to hold onto. First, the reveal phase is always about shifting from the what to the why. We are looking for the mechanism, not just the symptom. Second, remember that the therapeutic partnership is built on narrative medicine. You are listening to a story that spans a lifetime. Third, use the building blocks of antecedents, triggers, and mediators to guide your investigation. Fourth, always keep biochemical individuality in mind. Two people might walk into your office with the exact same diagnosis, but they will almost always have different root causes. Your job is to find the unique path for the person sitting in front of you.

You are acting as a clinical detective. You are using this phase to gather all the clues you will need when we move into the next stage, which is the organize phase. You are doing great work, and the skills you are building right now are what will set you apart in the world of functional medicine.

I am so proud of the commitment you are making to your education and to your future clients. Take some time to reflect on these concepts, and I will see you in the next lesson where we will start putting these tools into practice. Great work today. See you soon.
