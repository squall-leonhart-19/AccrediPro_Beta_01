Hi, it’s Sarah. I’m so glad you’re here with me today. In our last lesson, we took a deep dive into the Total Toxic Burden. We looked at how the modern world constantly tests our physiological limits. But today, we’re going to answer a question that probably keeps many of your clients up at night. Why does one person thrive in a busy urban environment while another person struggles with even minimal exposures? The answer lies in the genetic blueprint. It’s about how environmental signals flip the switches on our DNA.

Welcome to the most foundational layer of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™. This is the "Reveal" phase. For decades, we were taught that our genes were our destiny. We thought our health was a fixed script written at birth. But today, we know that isn't true. I like to say that genetics loads the gun, but epigenetics pulls the trigger. Our lifestyle, our environment, and even our mindset act as the finger on that trigger. As a practitioner, understanding this blueprint is your superpower. It allows you to offer a level of precision medicine that conventional care just can’t touch.

By the end of our time today, you’re going to be able to do five key things. First, you’ll define Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, or SNPs, and understand how they impact biochemical pathways. Second, you’ll be able to analyze the clinical relevance of what I call the "Big Three" genes: MTHFR, COMT, and APOE. Third, you’ll learn to distinguish between a fixed genetic risk and modifiable epigenetic expression. Fourth, I’m going to give you strategies to talk about genetic findings without causing "genomic anxiety." And finally, we’ll evaluate which testing platforms actually deserve a place in your practice.

Let’s start with this idea of Genetic Destiny versus Epigenetic Expression. Many of your clients will come to you feeling "broken." They’ve watched their mother struggle with autoimmune issues. They saw their father deal with early-onset heart disease. They assume the same fate is waiting for them. This is the old paradigm. It’s called Genetic Determinism. It’s the belief that we are victims of our biology.

But the new paradigm is Epigenetics. I want you to think of your DNA as a massive library of cookbooks. Each gene is a single recipe. Now, just because you have a recipe for a very spicy curry in your library doesn't mean you’re cooking it right now. Epigenetics is the chef. The chef decides which books to pull off the shelf. The chef decides which recipes to prepare based on two things: the ingredients available and the state of the kitchen. In this analogy, the ingredients are your nutrients. The kitchen environment represents your toxins, your stress, and your sleep.

When you explain this to a client, use the Light Switch Analogy. Tell them, "You might have a switch for inflammation in your DNA. But your lifestyle determines if that switch is flipped 'ON' or 'OFF'." This simple shift in language is incredibly powerful. It moves the client from a victim mindset to one of empowerment and agency. They realize they have the power to change the outcome.

Now, let’s talk about the "typos" in the blueprint. These are called Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, or SNPs. We usually pronounce it as "snips." Even though we share 99.9% of our DNA with every other human on earth, that tiny 0.1% difference is where the magic happens. That’s where our biochemical individuality lives.

A SNP happens when a single letter in the genetic code is replaced by another. Think of it like a typo in a sentence. If the sentence is "The cat sat on the mat," a SNP might change it to "The hat sat on the mat." The meaning changes slightly. In the body, this means an enzyme might work a little slower or a little faster. A major study in Nature Genetics found that these variations can alter enzyme function by anywhere from 20% to 70%. That is a massive range. It significantly impacts how a client detoxifies, how they produce energy, and how they manage stress.

In the Reveal phase of our work, we don’t look at every single gene. There are over 20,000 of them. That would be overwhelming and, frankly, not very useful. Instead, we focus on "high-leverage" genes. These are the genes where we have clear, actionable interventions. I call these the "Big Three."

The first of the Big Three is MTHFR. This is the enzyme responsible for methylation. Specifically, it converts inactive folate into 5-MTHF, which is active folate. If this enzyme isn't working well, your client cannot properly "methylate." Now, why does that matter? Methylation is required for DNA repair. It’s required for detoxification. It’s required for making neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Roughly 40% to 50% of the population carries a variant here. When you see a client with chronic fatigue, anxiety, or high homocysteine levels, MTHFR should be the first thing on your mind. We support this with methylated B-vitamins and lots of leafy greens.

The second gene is COMT. I call this the "Stress Manager." COMT is responsible for breaking down catecholamines. These are things like dopamine, norepinephrine, and even estrogen. Some people have a "slow" COMT variant. We often call this the "Worrier" phenotype. Because their enzyme works slowly, dopamine stays in their brain longer. These people are often high-achievers. They are brilliant and focused. But they struggle with anxiety and racing thoughts because they can’t clear those stress hormones quickly. They get "wired and tired." For these clients, magnesium and stress management aren't just "good ideas"—they are biological necessities.

The third gene is APOE. This is often called the "Brain Guard." The APOE4 variant is the one most associated with late-onset Alzheimer's. In conventional medicine, people often see this as a death sentence. But in Functional Medicine, we see it differently. We view APOE4 as a "pro-inflammatory" phenotype. It just means the person is very sensitive to their environment. They need a very specific approach to fats and toxin exposure. If we know this early, we can change the entire trajectory of their brain health.

Let me tell you about a client named Sarah to show you how this looks in the real world. Sarah was 52, a high-level marketing executive. She came to me feeling completely exhausted but also "wired." She had terrible insomnia and brain fog. She was also dealing with signs of estrogen dominance. She had been a high-performer her whole life, but when she hit perimenopause, she hit a wall. Her doctors had offered her antidepressants and sleeping pills, but she knew something else was going on.

During the Reveal phase, we did genomic testing. We found that Sarah had a Slow COMT gene and the MTHFR C677T variant. This was the "aha" moment. Her body was struggling to clear estrogen because of the slow COMT. She was also deficient in the methyl groups she needed to stabilize her mood because of the MTHFR.

Our intervention was targeted. We didn't just give her a general multivitamin. We introduced Magnesium Glycinate to support her COMT enzyme. We gave her a methylated B-complex to bypass the MTHFR bottleneck. We also had her increase her intake of cruciferous vegetables to help clear that estrogen. Within just six weeks, her anxiety dropped by 60%. She started sleeping through the night for the first time in years. She wasn't "broken"—she just needed to understand her unique user manual.

This brings us to the environmental triggers. Remember, the gene is just the switch. We have to identify what is flipping that switch. Usually, it’s one of the ROOTS we’ve discussed. It could be nutritional deficiencies, like a lack of B12 for someone with MTHFR. It could be a toxic burden, where heavy metals are blocking enzyme pathways. It could be emotional stress overwhelming a slow COMT enzyme. Or it could be circadian disruption. When we ignore our natural light cycles, we actually alter our gene expression patterns.

As a Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner™, adding this kind of genomic analysis to your practice changes everything. It significantly increases your value. A standard health coach might charge $150 an hour. But practitioners who offer these "Genomic Deep Dives" often command $350 to $500 per session. There is a huge market for this. Women in their 40s and 50s, especially, are very invested in "pre-emptive" health. They’ve seen their parents struggle with chronic disease, and they want a different path. You are giving them the map.

However, there is a big responsibility that comes with this. The biggest mistake a new practitioner can make is scaring the client with their data. Please, never tell a client, "You have the Alzheimer's gene." That is irresponsible and it’s actually clinically inaccurate. Instead, I want you to focus on function.

Here is a script you can use. You might say, "Your APOE results suggest your body is very sensitive to inflammation and certain types of fats. This is actually a 'gift' of information. It tells us exactly how to eat and live to keep your brain sharp and healthy for the next 40 years." Do you hear the difference? One sounds like a death sentence. The other sounds like an instruction manual for a long, healthy life.

When you’re choosing a testing platform, be careful. Not all tests are created equal. I generally recommend avoiding "ancestry-only" tests for clinical work. You want to look for three things. First, data privacy. Make sure the company doesn't sell data to third parties. Second, clinical utility. You want reports that group genes by pathway—like methylation, detox, or lipid metabolism. It makes the data much easier to interpret. And third, make sure you can access the raw data. You want to be able to download that file for more advanced analysis if you need to.

Let’s wrap up with a summary of what we’ve covered. First, remember that genetics is not fate. Epigenetic signals like your diet, your stress levels, and your toxic exposure are what control gene expression. Second, focus on the SNPs. These "typos" in the DNA are what alter enzyme speed and change a person’s nutrient requirements.

Third, keep the "Big Three" in your mind at all times. MTHFR for methylation, COMT for stress and hormones, and APOE for brain and lipid health. These are your most actionable starting points. Fourth, always aim to empower, not alarm. Use this data to personalize a client’s "User Manual." And finally, use the R.O.O.T.S. Method™ to refine your Reveal phase. This data tells you which interventions will have the highest impact for that specific individual.

You’re doing incredible work. By understanding the language of DNA, you’re moving beyond "one size fits all" health. You’re looking at the very core of what makes your clients unique.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
