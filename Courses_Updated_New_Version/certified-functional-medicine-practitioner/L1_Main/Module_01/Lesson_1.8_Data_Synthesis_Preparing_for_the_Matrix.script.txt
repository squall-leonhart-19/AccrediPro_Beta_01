Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so incredibly glad you have joined me for this lesson. In our previous sessions, we have done a lot of the heavy lifting. We have explored the Functional Medicine Matrix, we have mapped out the Clinical Timeline, and we have looked at the science behind why our bodies do what they do. But today, we are doing something different. We are moving from the "what" to the "how." It is time to take those theoretical tools and use them in a real, live conversation with a client. This is where we learn to "Reveal" their root cause story.

Welcome to the Practice Lab. I am so excited to help you bridge that gap between "knowing" and "doing." I have seen this transition so many times with my most successful students. Many of them were women just like you—perhaps you were a teacher, a nurse, or an executive—who decided to follow their passion for healing. Their biggest breakthrough always came at the same moment. It was the moment they stopped acting like a "student" who was trying to get the right answer, and they started speaking like a "practitioner" who was on a mission to find the truth. This lab is designed to give you that specific clinical confidence.

In our time together today, we have a few very clear goals. First, we are going to apply the "Reveal" framework to a realistic client intake scenario. You are going to see how the Matrix and the Timeline actually breathe life into a conversation. Second, we are going to practice transition statements. These are the specific phrases that build trust and establish your clinical authority without you sounding cold or clinical. Third, we are going to learn how to identify those subtle cues in a client’s history—the little things they say that point directly to metabolic or hormonal imbalances. And finally, I’m going to show you how to navigate those common objections that come up when you move the conversation away from just talking about symptoms and start investigating the root cause.

Before we get into the actual script, I want you to meet someone. Her name is Diane. I want you to really picture her as I describe her, because Diane is representative of the "ideal" client you are likely to see in your practice. She is high-functioning, she is capable, but she is feeling the heavy weight of chronic, unresolved symptoms. She is the kind of woman who is doing her best but feels like her body is failing her.

Diane is fifty-two years old. She is a retired elementary school teacher living in Austin, Texas. She is married, has three adult children, and one precious grandchild. Now, when Diane comes to you, her chief complaints are very specific. She reports what she calls "crushing fatigue." It isn't just being tired; it is a wall that hits her every single day at 3:00 PM. She also wakes up with joint stiffness every morning, and over the last eighteen months, she has gained fifteen pounds, specifically around her midsection. 

When you talk to Diane, she says something to you that I hear almost every single week in my private practice. She says, "Sarah, I’m doing everything right. I’m eating salads, I’m walking the dog, but I feel like I’m aging ten years for every one calendar year." 

Now, let's look at her medical history for a second. Last year, her doctor told her she has "borderline" high blood pressure. But the doctor also told her that this is "just part of menopause" and suggested she just try a low-carb diet. 

In my experience, when a client like Diane says they are "doing everything right" but they are still gaining weight and feeling exhausted, it is actually a massive clue. It isn't a sign that she is failing; it is a sign that the body is under internal stress. It tells us that our "Reveal" session needs to focus on things like gut dysbiosis or cortisol dysregulation, rather than just the old, tired advice of "calories in versus calories out." 

So, I want you to prepare yourself to step into the role of the practitioner. We are going to walk through a coaching script together. As I go through these lines, I want you to actually say them out loud with me. Don't just listen. Your nervous system needs to "hear" you being the expert. It needs to get used to the resonance of your voice as you lead a clinical conversation.

Imagine you are sitting with Diane. You have her timeline in front of you. You start by saying, "Diane, I’ve spent some time reviewing your history and your timeline. I want to start by saying I hear you. That 3:00 PM fatigue sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you feel like you’re doing all the right things with your diet and movement."

Do you hear the tone there? It is warm, but it is focused. You are acknowledging her pain, but you are also showing her that you have done your homework.

Then, you move into the "Reveal." You might say, "I noticed on your timeline that your joint stiffness and that shift in your weight really started to accelerate about eighteen months ago. That’s also right around the time you retired from teaching after thirty years. Can you tell me what that transition was like for you?"

This is a pivotal moment. Most practitioners would just ignore the retirement and focus on the joint pain. But you are looking for the "Antecedent." Diane might respond by saying, "Oh, retirement was supposed to be relaxing! But honestly, I think my body just crashed. I went from being on my feet all day, highly stressed but active, to… well, to this. And I’m also helping more with my grandbaby now, which I love, but I’m exhausted."

Now, here is where you make the connection. You say, "That makes so much sense, Diane. Sometimes, when we move from a high-stress environment—like a classroom—into a new phase of life, our nervous system finally lets its guard down. But if our 'stress bucket' was already full, that transition can actually trigger an inflammatory response. Those 'borderline' blood pressure numbers and the joint stiffness? They aren't just 'age.' They are signs that your body’s internal thermostat is trying to find its balance again."

Notice what we did there. We didn't give her a supplement list. We didn't tell her to take magnesium or fish oil yet. A "Reveal" session is about making connections that the client has never seen before. When you can show a woman that her retirement, her stress levels, and her joint pain are all connected to the same physiological root, you aren't just a coach anymore. You are a detective. Practitioners who master this level of insight can easily charge three hundred to five hundred dollars for an initial deep-dive session because the client finally feels understood. For many of these women, it is the first time in ten years they haven't felt like they were just a collection of random symptoms.

Now, as you practice this, I want to talk about some of the common pitfalls I see. When you are starting out, it is so easy to fall into what I call the "Fixer Trap." You want to help so badly that you start jumping in too soon. 

One major pitfall is interrupting. You might hear her mention joint pain and immediately want to tell her about turmeric. But I want you to practice active listening. Let her finish her story. I have found that the real "gold"—the piece of information that actually solves the case—is often in the last ten percent of what the client says. If you interrupt at the ninety percent mark, you miss the breakthrough.

Another pitfall is over-explaining. I know you are excited about the science. You’ve learned about mitochondrial biogenesis and the HPA axis, and you want to show her you know your stuff. But if you use too much medical jargon too early, you will lose her. Instead, use analogies. Instead of talking about mitochondria, talk about "energy power plants." Instead of the endocrine system, talk about the "body's thermostat." It makes the science feel accessible and safe.

And please, never dismiss stress. A huge mistake is treating a client’s stress as "just emotional." In functional medicine, we know that stress is biological. When Diane tells you she is stressed about her retirement or her family, don't just nod and move on. Explain to her how that stress physically triggers the inflammation that is making her joints stiff and her midsection hold onto weight. This is called biological integration, and it is a hallmark of a master practitioner.

I remember my very first client. I was so nervous that I think I talked for forty-five minutes out of our hour-long session. She only talked for fifteen. I was so busy trying to prove I was an expert that I didn't actually listen to her story. Now, years later, I always aim for a thirty-seventy split. I talk for thirty percent of the time, and I let the client talk for seventy percent. That is where the real "Reveal" happens. It happens in the silence between her sentences.

So, how do you know if your "Reveal" session was actually successful? There are three main signs I want you to look for. 

The first is the "Aha" Moment. This is when the client says something like, "I never realized my joint pain started at the same time as my digestive issues!" or "I never thought about how my sleep changed after my daughter moved out." When they start connecting the dots themselves, you know you’ve led them to the right place.

The second sign is a shift in tone. At the beginning of the session, Diane might sound defeated. She might say things like "I'm just old" or "This is just my life now." But as the "Reveal" unfolds, her tone will move toward curiosity. She will start asking, "So, we can actually fix this?" That shift from defeat to curiosity is the moment the healing process truly begins.

The third sign is trust building. This is when the client shares a "secret" symptom—something they didn't put on their intake form. Maybe it is low libido, or brain fog that makes them feel like they are losing their mind, or a specific fear they have about their health. When they share those vulnerable details, it means you have created a safe enough space for the truth to come out.

If you are sitting there right now feeling a little bit of imposter syndrome, I want you to take a deep breath. Remember this: Diane doesn't need you to be a doctor. She has already seen doctors. She needs you to be the detective. She needs someone who will finally put the pieces of her life together and show her the big picture. You are the bridge to her healing.

Let's take a moment to reflect on what we've covered. I want to ask you a few questions to help solidify this in your mind. 

First, why do you think it is so important to ask Diane about her life transitions, like her retirement, during the Reveal phase? Think about that for a second. It's because those transitions are often the "triggering events" or the "mediators" on our matrix. They shift the internal environment of the body.

Second, what is the primary goal of this "Reveal" conversation compared to a conventional medical intake? In a conventional setting, the goal is often just to find a diagnosis—a label. But in our world, the goal is connection. We are connecting the dots of her entire life to find the "why" behind the symptoms.

Third, if a client like Diane says, "I've tried everything and nothing works," how should you respond? Instead of listing more things for her to try, you should lean in with empathy. You might say, "I hear how exhausting that has been. It sounds like you’ve worked really hard. My goal is to look at the areas that perhaps haven't been explored yet, like how your internal stress response is affecting your metabolism."

And finally, which success marker do you think indicates the highest level of rapport? It is almost always when the client shares that "secret" symptom. It shows they trust your clinical authority and your heart.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways for your practice. 

First, always remember that the "Reveal" phase is about connection, not just collection. You aren't just collecting data points; you are connecting the threads of a human life. 

Second, your voice and your tone are actual clinical tools. When you use a warm, calm, and authoritative tone, you are actually helping to lower the client's stress response right there in the session. You are co-regulating with them.

Third, avoid that "Fixer Trap." I know the urge to help is strong, but don't rush to suggest supplements or protocols before the client feels fully and completely heard. The "hearing" is part of the "healing."

And fourth, please practice this out loud! Talk to your mirror, talk to your dog, or find a study partner. The more you say these words—words like "antecedents," "mediators," and "root cause"—the more they will become your natural professional language. You will stop feeling like you are playing a part and start feeling like the expert you truly are.

Research consistently shows that the quality of the practitioner-client relationship is one of the strongest predictors of clinical outcomes. When a client feels understood, they are more likely to follow through on their protocols and more likely to see the results they are looking for. By mastering the "Reveal," you are setting both yourself and your clients up for incredible success.

Great work today. You are doing the deep work that is going to change lives. I am so proud of the progress you are making. Keep practicing, keep listening, and I will see you in the next lesson.
