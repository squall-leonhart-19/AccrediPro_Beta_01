            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which transcription factor serves as the 'master switch' for the pro-inflammatory response, orchestrating the expression of over 200 genes involved in the cytokine storm?",
            "options": [
                "NRF2",
                "NF-κB",
                "PPAR-gamma",
                "FOXP3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NF-κB (Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) is the primary transcription factor that triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the context of the Gut-Immune Axis, what is the clinical significance of a low Secretory IgA (sIgA) level on a functional stool analysis?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates an overactive autoimmune response in the colon.",
                "It suggests a depletion of the mucosal immune barrier and increased susceptibility to infections.",
                "It is a diagnostic marker for Celiac disease.",
                "It confirms the presence of pathogenic parasites."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "sIgA is the primary immunoglobulin of the mucosal surfaces; low levels indicate 'immune exhaustion' or a weakened first line of defense, often seen in chronic stress or malnutrition."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A patient presents with high antibodies to Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) following a severe bout of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). This phenomenon, where a foreign antigen shares structural similarities with self-antigens, is known as:",
            "options": [
                "Bystander Activation",
                "Epitope Spreading",
                "Molecular Mimicry",
                "Autophagy Failure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses a foreign peptide (like an EBV protein) with a self-protein (like TPO) due to structural similarity, leading to autoimmunity."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs), derived from EPA and DHA, differ from NSAIDs in what primary way?",
            "options": [
                "SPMs block the COX-2 enzyme entirely.",
                "SPMs are immunosuppressive rather than immunomodulatory.",
                "SPMs actively facilitate the 'clearance' of cellular debris and the return to homeostasis without suppressing the initial immune response.",
                "SPMs are only effective against viral infections."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike NSAIDs which inhibit the start of inflammation, SPMs facilitate the 'resolution' phase, helping macrophages clear apoptotic cells and debris to end the inflammatory cycle."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which specific environmental toxin is most closely associated with the disruption of tight junctions via the release of zonulin, leading to 'leaky gut' even in non-celiac patients?",

                "Bisphenol A (BPA)",
                "Aflatoxin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glyphosate has been shown in various studies to disrupt the gut microbiome and increase intestinal permeability by triggering zonulin release, similar to the action of gliadin."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In functional medicine, an hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) level of 2.8 mg/L would be interpreted as:",
            "options": [
                "Optimal/Low risk",
                "Average/Moderate systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk",
                "Acute infection requiring immediate hospitalization",
                "Completely normal; only levels above 10 mg/L are significant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While conventional ranges often look for >10 mg/L for acute issues, functional medicine views 1.0–3.0 mg/L as moderate systemic inflammation and increased risk for chronic disease."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Which subset of T-cells is responsible for maintaining self-tolerance and is often found to be deficient or dysfunctional in cases of systemic autoimmunity?",

                "Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Treg cells (characterized by the FOXP3 marker) are the 'peacekeepers' of the immune system; their failure allows pro-inflammatory TH1 and TH17 cells to attack self-tissue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "Which 'stealth pathogen' is known for its ability to hide within biofilms and undergo 'antigenic variation' to evade detection by the host's adaptive immune system?",

                "Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme)",
                "Staphylococcus aureus",
                "Escherichia coli",
                "Rhinovirus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Borrelia burgdorferi uses complex mechanisms like biofilm formation and changing its surface proteins (antigenic variation) to persist in the body for years."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "According to the lesson on lifestyle and immune resilience, what is the effect of chronic sleep deprivation on Natural Killer (NK) cell activity?",
            "options": [
                "It increases NK cell activity to compensate for fatigue.",
                "It has no measurable effect on NK cells.",
                "A single night of 4 hours of sleep can reduce NK cell activity by up to 70%.",
                "It only affects B-cell antibody production, not NK cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (notably by Dr. Michael Irwin) has shown that even modest sleep restriction (4 hours for one night) results in a massive (70%) reduction in NK cell surveillance activity."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical acts as a natural ionophore, helping to transport Zinc into the intracellular compartment to inhibit viral replication enzymes like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Quercetin is a potent zinc ionophore, meaning it facilitates the movement of zinc across the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, where zinc can then exert its antiviral effects."
