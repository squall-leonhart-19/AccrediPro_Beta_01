Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you joined me for this practice lab. We have spent a lot of time lately diving deep into the science. We have covered insulin resistance and blood sugar spikes. We have explored the mechanics of metabolic flexibility. But here is the honest truth. Knowing the science is only half the battle. The real magic of being a coach happens in the conversation. It happens when you are sitting across from a real human being. You need to be able to turn that complex physiology into a supportive and empowering story. You want your client to feel seen and heard. You never want them to feel judged.

In this lesson, I will teach you how to bridge the gap between the lab and the living room. We are going to practice translating the blood sugar rollercoaster into a relatable analogy. We will work on active listening during those difficult moments when a client shares their symptoms. I want you to see the clear difference between clinical lecturing and a true coaching partnership. By the end of our time today, you will have the confidence to explain metabolic health to women in midlife. We are going to apply the Reveal phase philosophy to real-world metabolic dysfunction.

I know exactly how it feels when you are first starting out. You have all this incredible information in your head. You understand the Krebs cycle and the insulin response. But then a client looks at you and says they can’t stop eating bread. Suddenly, imposter syndrome kicks in. You might feel like you need to prove your worth by using big clinical words. I want to tell you right now that you don't need to do that. Today, we are going to practice turning that "lecturer" voice into a "partner" voice.

Let’s start with a scenario. This is a client profile that I see almost every single week in my private practice. Let’s look at Elena. Elena is fifty-two years old. She was a former administrative assistant but she’s been out of the workforce for a while. She is an empty nester now and she is getting ready to re-enter the professional world. Elena comes to you because she feels like she is falling apart. She has intense brain fog that hits her every day at three in the afternoon. She describes episodes of being "hangry" where she snaps at her husband over nothing. She’s also frustrated by a fifteen-pound weight gain around her midsection. She tells you it won’t budge no matter what she does. She is even eating salads for lunch every single day.

But here is the most important part of Elena’s profile. It’s her mindset. Elena tells you that she just doesn't have the discipline she used to have. She feels like a failure because she can't stop reaching for the crackers in the afternoon. She is blaming her character for a problem that is actually happening in her cells. In our practice, we see many women in their forties and fifties doing this. They blame themselves for a lack of willpower. Your job as a coach is to reveal the truth. You need to show her that her symptoms are a physiological response to blood sugar instability. They are not a character flaw.

When you work with women like Elena, you are entering a very high-value space. Practitioners who specialize in this kind of support often see a ninety percent retention rate. Their three-month programs usually range from twelve hundred to twenty-five hundred dollars. Why? Because you aren't just giving her a diet. You are giving her her life back. You are helping her understand that her metabolic engine needs a different type of fuel now that her hormones have changed. Elena is likely comparing herself to her thirty-year-old self. We need to help her move past that comparison and into a place of understanding.

Now, I want to walk you through a practice script. I call this The Rollercoaster Reveal. I want you to imagine you are speaking to Elena right now. I’m going to say these words, and I want you to really listen to the tone. Then, I want you to find a quiet corner and say them out loud yourself. Your brain needs to hear your own voice saying these professional yet warm phrases.

Here is what I would say to Elena. "Elena, I hear how frustrated you are. You feel like you’re failing because you’re reaching for those crackers. But I want to offer you a different perspective. Imagine your blood sugar is like a rollercoaster. When you have that salad with fat-free dressing for lunch, your blood sugar goes up fast. But because there isn't enough protein or healthy fat to slow it down, it crashes just as fast. By three o’clock, you are at the bottom of that big drop. Your brain sees that crash as a true emergency. It sends out a massive signal saying it needs energy right now. That is why you reach for the crackers. It’s not a lack of discipline. It’s your body trying to save you from a perceived crisis. My job is to help you get off the rollercoaster so you can feel steady again."

Think about that last paragraph for a moment. If you can, record yourself saying it on your phone. When you listen back, ask yourself a few questions. Do you sound like a supportive partner? Or do you sound like a lecturing teacher? You should aim for a tone that is calm and authoritative. It should also be deeply kind. You are not a drill sergeant. You are a guide.

Let’s compare two different coaching approaches. Imagine Elena just told you about her afternoon snack habit. A traditional coach might say something like, "Just try harder to avoid the crackers." Or they might say, "Eat less and move more." Think about how that makes Elena feel. It increases her shame. It reinforces her belief that she is the problem. It focuses entirely on calories and restriction.

Now, imagine the Functional Practitioner approach. You would say, "Let’s look at why your body is asking for the crackers." You might say, "Let’s stabilize your blood sugar to unlock your energy." This approach focuses on metabolic flexibility and hormone balance. It increases the client’s agency. It gives her a sense of understanding. When you explain the "why" behind a symptom, you move from being a health enthusiast to a Certified Practitioner. This is exactly why clients are willing to pay premium prices. They aren't paying for a meal plan. You can find meal plans for free on the internet. They are paying for your expertise. They are paying for freedom from their own self-judgment.

Even experienced coaches can fall into common traps. I want to talk about these because awareness is ninety percent of the battle. The first one is the "Lecture Trap." This happens when you spend ten minutes explaining the details of cellular respiration while the client’s eyes glaze over. You have to keep the science focused on "need-to-know" analogies. Elena needs to know about the rollercoaster. She doesn't need a PhD-level lecture on biochemistry in her first session.

The second trap is the "Fix-It Reflex." This is when you jump straight to a supplement recommendation before the client even feels heard. The Reveal phase is about understanding. It is not just about fixing. If you skip the understanding, the client won't stick to the protocol. They need to believe in the "why" before they will commit to the "how."

The third trap is ignoring the emotional component. Elena’s "hangry" episodes cause her real shame. She feels bad about snapping at her husband. If you don’t acknowledge that shame, your protocol won't stick. You have to address the heart as much as the hormones. Finally, watch out for using the phrase "You should." This is a huge trigger for a client's inner critic. Instead, try using phrases like "What if we tried..." or "I wonder if..." This keeps the conversation collaborative.

Now, how do you know if a coaching session actually worked? There are a few success markers I always look for. The first one is what I call "The Exhale." This is a physical moment. You will see the client’s shoulders drop. They physically relax. This happens when they realize their symptoms aren't their fault. It is a massive weight off their back.

The second marker is connection. The client might say something like, "Nobody has ever explained it to me that way before." This tells you that you have moved past the surface level. You have provided real value. The third marker is the "Aha-Moment." This is when the client starts connecting their own dots. They might say, "Oh! That’s why I get a headache after my morning oatmeal!" When they start making those connections, you know they are truly learning.

The final marker is collaboration. This is when the client helps design the next step. Instead of you telling them what to do, they say, "I think I could try adding an egg to my breakfast." This is the gold standard of coaching. It means they are taking ownership of their health.

I always keep a small notebook of "Client Wins." Whenever a client like Elena tells me she didn't snap at her husband because her energy was stable, I write it down. It reminds me that this work is about more than just numbers on a scale. It is about changing lives. You are helping people find peace with their bodies. You are helping them show up better for their families. You are changing lives, one blood sugar spike at a time.

Let’s do a quick check of what we’ve covered. Why is the "Blood Sugar Rollercoaster" a better explanation than "You need more willpower"? It’s because the rollercoaster explains the biology. It removes the blame. Willpower is a limited resource, but biology is a system we can manage. What is the "Emergency Signal" the brain sends during a blood sugar crash? It’s a survival mechanism. The brain thinks it is starving, so it demands quick energy in the form of sugar or refined carbs. Which coaching trap involves giving too much clinical detail? That’s the Lecture Trap. And finally, how does the Reveal phase philosophy apply to Elena’s weight gain? It helps her see that her weight gain is a symptom of hormonal signaling and insulin levels, not just a lack of exercise.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways for your practice. First, always choose biology over blame. Frame every metabolic symptom as a physiological response to an input. It is never about a character flaw. Second, remember that analogies are your power. Use terms like "Rollercoasters," "Engines," and "Fuel." These words make complex science feel accessible and actionable.

Third, listen for the shame. When a client mentions "willpower" or "guilt," stop what you are doing. Address the biology immediately to build trust. And finally, lean into your professional authority. Your ability to explain the "why" is what separates you from a general health coach. It is what makes you a Functional Practitioner.

Research in journals like JAMA Internal Medicine and the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition supports this approach. We know that the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity offers a much deeper understanding than the old "calories in, calories out" model. We know that metabolic signaling is a key factor in weight management. When you share this expertise, you are bringing the latest science into your client's life.

Great work today. You are developing the skills that will make you an exceptional coach. I want you to keep practicing that script. Record yourself. Listen to your tone. The more you say these words, the more natural they will become. I am so proud of the progress you are making. I will see you in the next lesson.
