Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here with me today. In this lesson, we are going to dive into one of the most critical, yet often overlooked, phases of the R.O.O.T.S. Method. We are talking about the Sustain Phase. Specifically, we’re looking at how we move our clients from the high-energy, high-intervention start of a protocol into a way of living that actually lasts for the rest of their lives.

In our previous lessons, we spent a lot of time on the data. We looked at objective longevity biomarkers. We looked at the labs and the numbers. But today, we shift our focus. We are moving from what we are measuring to how we ensure the patient remains engaged. This is a massive shift in your role as a practitioner. In the early phases, you were the detective. You were the architect. You were finding the root causes and building the plan. But now, in the Sustain Phase, your role evolves. You are becoming a mentor.

True physiological resilience cannot exist without psychological resilience. We see it all the time. A client gets great results for three months, and then life happens. They hit a wall. They stop the supplements. They go back to old habits. Why? Because sustained change requires moving from practitioner-led intervention to patient-led empowerment. My goal for you by the end of this lesson is to have the behavioral frameworks to ensure your clients don't just "finish a protocol." I want them to embody a permanent lifestyle shift.

We’re going to master advanced Motivational Interviewing techniques for long-term maintenance. We’re going to learn how to spot the clinical signs of "Health Burnout" before it ruins your client's progress. We’ll talk about the incredible physiological impact of social connection. I’ll teach you how to help your clients develop "Body Literacy." And finally, we’ll look at how to build a support system that works even when they aren't in your office.

Let’s start with the psychology of staying the course. We use Motivational Interviewing, or MI, in the Reveal and Target phases to help people overcome their hesitation about starting. But in this Sustain phase, the challenge is different. It’s not about initiation anymore. It’s about persistence.

There is some really sobering research out there. A 2022 systematic review found that while about 80% of people can start a healthy habit, only about 18 to 22% actually keep it up past the one-year mark. That’s a huge gap. That gap exists because most people don't have the psychological scaffolding they need.

Maintenance MI requires a shift from what we call "Change Talk" to "Sustainability Talk." Think about it this way. You’re no longer asking a client, "Why do you want to lose weight?" or "Why do you want to fix your gut?" Instead, you’re asking, "How does this new rhythm of life serve your identity?" This is a deep question. It moves the focus from a goal to a person’s sense of self.

When you’re talking to your clients now, I want you to use open-ended questions that focus on the "how" of their daily life. Instead of just asking about their health goals, ask them how their current energy level allows them to show up for their family. This connects the physiological state—having more energy—to the psychological driver—being a present parent.

You also want to use affirmations, but make them specific to their resilience. Instead of saying, "You did great starting the diet," try something like, "I really admire how you navigated that incredibly stressful week at work without compromising your sleep hygiene." Do you hear the difference? You’re affirming their ability to handle stress, not just their ability to follow a rule.

Reflections are also powerful here. If a client is struggling, you might say, "It sounds like you’ve moved from 'having' to do this to 'being' someone who values this." You are reflecting back to them their own internal growth. You are summarizing not just a plan of action, but their growth in self-efficacy.

Now, I know many of you listening are career changers. You might be feeling a bit of "imposter syndrome" right now. You might think, "Sarah, I’m not a therapist. Should I really be talking about identity and psychology?" Here is what I want you to remember. You are a Health Strategist. Your unique value lies in connecting their physiological data to their psychological drivers. When a client sees their inflammation markers drop because they finally learned to set boundaries at work, that is Functional Medicine in action. You aren't just treating a lab value; you are treating a human being.

Next, we have to talk about a major obstacle in the Sustain Phase: Health Burnout. I also call this "Protocol Fatigue." This is a state of psychological exhaustion. It happens when the effort a person has to put into their health regimen starts to feel like it’s bigger than the reward they’re getting from it.

I see this most often in women between the ages of 40 and 55. We call them the "sandwich generation." They are often caring for aging parents while also raising children and managing demanding careers. They are already stretched thin. If their health protocol feels like one more heavy thing they have to carry, they will eventually drop it.

You need to watch for the signs. Is your client becoming cynical? Are they asking, "Does it even matter if I take these supplements?" Are they losing their belief that they can "do it right"? Are they starting to avoid you? If a client who used to love tracking their data suddenly stops, or starts missing appointments, that is a huge red flag for burnout.

Let me tell you about a client of mine named Sarah. She was a 48-year-old former teacher dealing with Hashimoto’s and perimenopause. She was six months into her Sustain Phase. She was doing everything "right." She was on a strict AIP diet, taking eight different supplements, and strength training five times a week.

On paper, she was a success story. Her inflammation markers were low. Her TPO antibodies had dropped by 70%. But when she sat down across from me, she was miserable. She told me she was "exhausted from being healthy." She felt like her entire life revolved around her thyroid. She couldn't go out to dinner with friends. She couldn't relax.

We had to pivot. We implemented what I call a "Protocol Sabbatical." This is a strategic recovery protocol. We didn't stop everything, but we simplified. We reduced her supplements to the "Big 3" essentials. We moved her from a strict diet to a 90/10 rule, which gave her some much-needed flexibility. And most importantly, we replaced two of her intense gym sessions with social walks with her friends.

Do you know what happened? Her stress markers, her salivary cortisol, actually improved during this sabbatical. Even though she was doing "less" for her health, her body was doing better. This proved that the stress of the protocol itself had become a bigger root cause than the Hashimoto’s. As practitioners, we have to be brave enough to tell a client to do less when the "more" is causing them harm.

This leads us directly into the social determinants of longevity. We cannot talk about sustained health in a vacuum. We are social creatures. There was a landmark meta-analysis of 148 different studies with over 300,000 participants. It found that people with stronger social relationships had a 50% increased likelihood of survival compared to those with weak social ties.

Let that sink in for a second. A 50% increase in survival. That effect is as big as the impact of quitting smoking. It actually exceeds the impact of obesity or physical inactivity. In Functional Medicine, we have to view social connection as a biological necessity. It is not a "nice to have" luxury.

When we are isolated, it triggers something called the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity, or CTRA. This is a genetic response. It literally upregulates pro-inflammatory genes and downregulates the genes that protect us from viruses. Loneliness is pro-inflammatory at a cellular level.

This is why I am such a huge advocate for Group Coaching Programs, especially in the Sustain Phase. When you group 5 to 10 clients who are all in maintenance mode, you are providing them with the "Community" root cause. You are giving them a space where they aren't the "weird one" with the dietary restrictions. They have a tribe.

And from a business perspective, this is a game-changer for you as a practitioner. Imagine having a maintenance group where 10 people pay $297 a month. You’re generating almost $3,000 for maybe four hours of work a month. It’s a win for their health and a win for your practice.

Now, let’s talk about the ultimate goal of everything we do in the CFMP program. The goal is to make yourself redundant. I know that sounds strange, but the best practitioners are the ones whose clients eventually don't need them anymore. We achieve this by teaching "Body Literacy."

Body Literacy is the ability of a patient to read their own physiological signals and adjust their lifestyle accordingly. They shouldn't need to call you every time they feel a little bloated or have a bad night's sleep. They should know what to do.

I use a three-part framework for this. The first part is Signal Recognition. We teach the client to link a symptom to a recent trigger. If they have brain fog in the afternoon, we help them look back at their lunch or their sleep the night before. We’re helping them connect the dots.

The second part is the "Yellow Light" Protocol. This is about knowing what to do when the first symptoms appear. It’s like a traffic light. Green means everything is great. Red means a full flare-up. But the Yellow Light is the warning. We might decide that if a client feels bloated, their personal "Yellow Light" protocol is to go back to bone broth and ginger for 48 hours. They have a plan. They feel in control.

The third part is Biofeedback Integration. We use tools like the Oura ring or Continuous Glucose Monitors, but not just for the sake of the data. We use them to build intuition. We want the client to be able to say, "I feel like my blood sugar is dipping," and then check the monitor to see if they’re right. Eventually, they won't even need the monitor. They’ll just know.

One tip I have for you here is to encourage your clients to keep a "Wins Journal" instead of just a "Symptom Tracker." In the maintenance phase, we want to reinforce the neural pathways of health-seeking behavior. If they only track what’s wrong, the protocol feels like a chore. If they track what’s going right—how they had the energy to play with their kids, or how they woke up feeling refreshed—the protocol starts to feel like part of their identity.

Finally, we have to look at the environment. Adherence is rarely about willpower. I really want you to hear that. It’s almost never about willpower. It’s about the ecosystem. To sustain change, a person’s environment has to support their new identity.

Think about the Digital Ecosystem. Are they using app-based reminders? Do they have a community forum they can check into? Are their wearables integrated in a way that provides helpful feedback rather than just more stress?

Then there’s the Physical Ecosystem. This is the "frictionless" health home. Is the kitchen organized so that healthy choices are the easiest ones to make? Is the lighting in their home supporting their circadian health? Do they have a dedicated station for their supplements so they aren't hunting through a cupboard every morning?

And perhaps most importantly, there is the Relational Ecosystem. We have to help our clients educate their spouses or partners. We want their loved ones to support them without becoming the "health police." Nobody wants to be nagged about what they’re eating. We want to help our clients build a support system where their new habits are just "the way we do things" in their household.

So, let’s wrap up what we’ve covered today.

First, remember that sustainability is psychological. You can have the best physiological protocol in the world, but if the psychological cost is too high, it won't last.

Second, social connection is medicine. It provides a 50% survival benefit. Never ignore the "Community" root cause.

Third, be on the lookout for Health Burnout. It is real, and it is common. Be willing to simplify protocols to ensure long-term success.

Fourth, your goal is patient autonomy. Success in the Sustain Phase is measured by your client's ability to self-regulate through Body Literacy.

And finally, environment trumps willpower every single time. Focus on building a supportive ecosystem rather than relying on internal motivation.

I want you to take a moment and think about one of your current clients. Are they showing any signs of protocol fatigue? How could you help them move toward more autonomy this week?

You are doing such important work. By focusing on these sustainability frameworks, you aren't just helping people get healthy—you’re helping them stay healthy for a lifetime.

Great work today. See you in the next lesson.
