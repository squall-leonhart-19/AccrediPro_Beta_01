Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you are joining me for this lesson. We have spent a lot of time talking about how to help our clients through the initial phases of healing. We have looked at how to uncover the root causes of their symptoms and how to use the principles of hormesis to build up their physiological resilience. But today, we are moving into a very special part of the R.O.O.T.S. Method. We are talking about the Sustain phase. This is where the real magic happens. This is where you transition from being a practitioner who fixes problems to being a true Health Architect.

In the previous lessons, we explored how hormesis builds that resilience. Today, we are going to learn how to measure it. We want to make sure your clients do not just feel better. We want to prove that they are actually slowing down their biological clock. This lesson is called The Cadence of Longevity, and it is all about the objective data that keeps our clients thriving for decades, not just months.

If you are coming into this field from a background in nursing, teaching, or even corporate management, this is the part of the work that will make you feel the most empowered. You are moving beyond crisis management. You are moving into Healthspan Optimization. Your value now lies in your ability to take complex lab data and translate it into a long-term roadmap. We are going to look at how to establish a testing schedule that makes sense. We are going to dive deep into the Big Four longevity biomarkers. We are going to talk about physical performance data like VO2 Max and grip strength. We will even touch on how to use wearables like CGMs and Oura rings without letting them take over your client's life. Most importantly, I am going to show you how to identify something I call Metabolic Drift. This is the key to catching issues before they ever become a disease.

Let’s start with the rhythm of your practice. We call this the Cadence of Longevity. When you are in the Reveal phase with a new client, you are testing often. You might be looking at labs every three or four months. This is necessary because you are monitoring the resolution of active dysfunction. You need to know if that gut protocol is working or if those thyroid markers are moving in the right direction. But once a client enters the Sustain phase, the goal changes. We want to find a balance between clinical necessity and long-term sustainability. If you test too much, you can actually create something called bio-anxiety. This is when a client becomes so obsessed with their numbers that the stress of the testing actually hurts their health. On the other hand, if you under-test, you might let subclinical issues start to fester.

I have found that many successful practitioners find a great rhythm by offering an Annual Longevity Audit. Think of this as a premium package for your long-term clients. You might charge a flat fee, perhaps between one thousand and fifteen hundred dollars. This covers the lab orders, a deep dive into their wearable data from the past year, and a ninety-minute session to map out the year ahead. This is wonderful for your business because it creates recurring revenue. But it is even better for the client because it gives them total peace of mind.

Generally, I recommend two tiers of re-testing in this phase. The first tier is bi-annual, meaning every six months. This is for your clients who have a history of high-risk markers. Maybe they struggled with pre-diabetes or they have a family history of heart disease and elevated ApoB. It is also for clients who are going through a lot of lifestyle stress, like a career change or a move. The second tier is annual. This is for your optimized clients. These are the people who are in a steady state of maintenance and resilience. They are doing the work, and they just need that yearly check-in to make sure everything is still on track.

Now, let’s talk about what we are actually measuring. While a standard metabolic panel is a good start, as functional practitioners, we need to look closer. We are looking for markers that predict all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events with high precision. We are not just looking for results that are within the standard reference range. We are looking for optimal longevity ranges.

The first of our Big Four is HbA1c. Most doctors will tell a client they are fine as long as this is under 5.7 percent. But in the longevity world, we want to see that number between 4.8 and 5.2 percent. HbA1c measures glycation. Think of glycation as the browning of a piece of toast, but happening inside your body. It is what happens when sugar sticks to your proteins. Higher levels of glycation are directly correlated with brain atrophy and vascular aging. When I see a client’s A1c creeping up toward 5.5 or 5.6, I know their body is struggling to manage glucose, even if they aren't diabetic yet.

The second marker is hs-CRP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. This is our primary marker for systemic inflammation. The conventional range says anything under 3.0 is fine. We want to see it under 0.5. Inflammation is the fire that drives almost every chronic disease we face. If this number is elevated, it tells us there is a fire burning somewhere, and we need to find it before it causes permanent damage.

Third, we have Homocysteine. This is a crucial marker for methylation status. Conventional ranges go all the way up to 15, but we want our clients under 7.0. When homocysteine is high, it acts like sandpaper on the inside of the blood vessels. It damages the endothelium and significantly increases the risk of dementia. It is a very clear signal that the body’s cellular repair mechanisms are not keeping up.

Finally, we have ApoB. This is perhaps the most important marker for cardiovascular health that most people have never heard of. Unlike standard LDL cholesterol, which measures the weight of the cholesterol, ApoB measures the actual number of particles that can cause plaques. Think of it this way. LDL is like measuring the weight of the trash in the trucks on a highway. ApoB is like counting the actual number of trucks. It is the number of trucks that causes the traffic jams and the accidents, not just how heavy they are. A landmark study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that ApoB is a much better predictor of heart disease than standard LDL, especially for people who are struggling with metabolic health. We want to see ApoB under 60 milligrams per deciliter for optimal longevity.

Moving beyond blood work, we have to look at the physical container. Functional medicine is not just about what is happening in the tubes of blood; it is about how the body performs. There are two metrics that stand out as the strongest predictors of a long healthspan. The first is VO2 Max. This is a measure of your cardiorespiratory fitness, or the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during intense exercise.

There was a massive study published in JAMA Network Open that looked at over one hundred and twenty-two thousand patients. They found that having low cardiorespiratory fitness was actually a higher risk for death than smoking or having end-stage renal disease. That is a staggering finding. If your client has a low VO2 Max, that is a bigger clinical priority than almost anything else. We want to see our clients in the top percentiles for their age group.

The second physical metric is grip strength and muscle mass. I often tell my clients that muscle is the organ of longevity. Grip strength is a fantastic proxy for total body strength and the integrity of the nervous system. The PURE study back in 2015 showed that for every five-kilogram decrease in grip strength, there was a sixteen percent increase in all-cause mortality. When we monitor these physical markers, we are getting a much more complete picture of a client’s true biological age.

I want to share a story about a practitioner named Sarah to show you how this looks in the real world. Sarah was a former nurse who had transitioned into wellness coaching. She felt great. She was eating well and exercising, but her annual labs started to show a very slow drift. Her HbA1c had moved up to 5.6 percent. Her hs-CRP was 1.8. Her VO2 Max was only in the 40th percentile for her age.

Even though Sarah felt fine, the data was telling a different story. We decided to make a few targeted interventions. She added just one session of high-intensity training each week to boost that VO2 Max. She increased her protein intake to 1.2 grams per pound of lean body mass to protect her muscle. And she used a Continuous Glucose Monitor for two weeks. What she found was shocking to her. Her healthy morning oatmeal was causing her blood sugar to spike all the way to 180. By catching that drift and making those small changes, one year later her A1c was down to 5.1, her inflammation was almost non-existent at 0.3, and her VO2 Max had jumped to the 75th percentile. Now, Sarah uses her own data to show her clients exactly why objective monitoring is so powerful.

Let’s talk about wearables for a moment. In the Sustain phase, technology like the Oura ring, the WHOOP strap, or a CGM acts like an assistant coach for you. These devices provide granular data that a once-a-year blood test will always miss. There are three main data streams I want you to focus on.

First is the Continuous Glucose Monitor, or CGM. This is essential for identifying glucose variability. We are not just looking at the average sugar levels; we are looking for the peaks and the valleys. It is those sharp spikes and crashes that drive oxidative stress and damage the cells. Second is Heart Rate Variability, or HRV. This is a direct window into the autonomic nervous system. If you see a client’s HRV trending downward over several months, it is often the very first sign that they are over-reaching or that there is hidden systemic inflammation starting to build up.

Third is sleep architecture. We want to monitor deep sleep and REM sleep. As we get older, deep sleep tends to decline naturally, but we can use this objective data to test our interventions. We can see if adding magnesium glycinate or lowering the room temperature actually improves the quality of their rest. Now, a word of caution here. Some clients can get very obsessed with their scores. They might wake up feeling great, see a low sleep score on their ring, and suddenly feel tired. You have to remind them that the data is a tool, not a judge. We are looking for trends over weeks and months, not single-night fluctuations.

This brings us to the concept of Metabolic Drift. This is one of the most important things you can teach your clients. Metabolic Drift is the slow, insidious movement of biomarkers from optimal back toward what conventional medicine calls normal. Because it happens so slowly, clients usually don't feel it. They don't notice the drift until they are already back in a symptomatic state.

As a practitioner, your job is to spot this. I recommend using a longitudinal spreadsheet or the graphing tools in your electronic health records. If a client’s fasting insulin was 4.0 last year, and then it is 5.5 this year, and 7.0 the year after, that is a trend. Even though all of those numbers are technically normal, the trend is moving toward insulin resistance. Catching this drift allows you to do a course correction. Maybe they need a ten-day detox, or maybe they need to shift their training focus. You are catching the whisper before the body has to scream.

When you see this happening, you can say to your client, "I am so glad we are looking at these trends. Your body is giving us a little whisper right now. Your insulin is trending up slightly, which means we caught it early. Let's look at what has changed in your stress or your sleep lately so we can get this back on track." This approach builds immense trust. It shows the client that you are looking out for them in a way that no one else is.

So, let’s recap what we have covered today. First, remember that the cadence of your testing matters. In the Sustain phase, move to annual or bi-annual testing. This maintains vigilance without burning your clients out. Second, focus on the Big Four. Prioritize HbA1c, hs-CRP, Homocysteine, and ApoB. These give you the most accurate view of biological aging.

Third, never forget that muscle is medicine. Always include physical metrics like grip strength and VO2 Max. Sometimes these are even more predictive of healthspan than blood work. Fourth, leverage those wearables. Use CGMs and HRV data to provide real-time feedback. This helps your clients connect their daily choices to their long-term health. And finally, watch the trends. Your true value as a Health Architect is in identifying that metabolic drift. You are looking for the subclinical changes that signal a need for adjustment before a disease can ever take root.

I want to leave you with a few questions to think about as you process this. Why do you think ApoB is such a superior marker to standard LDL for longevity? How would you explain the importance of VO2 Max to a client who only cares about losing weight? What would you do if you noticed a client’s markers were starting to drift, even though they said they were following the protocol perfectly? And finally, how can you use the concept of the Annual Longevity Audit to create more stability in your own practice?

You are doing incredible work. By moving into this high-level monitoring, you are providing a service that is truly rare in the healthcare world. You are helping people not just live longer, but live better. You are giving them the data they need to stay in control of their own health journey.

Great work today. I look forward to seeing you in the next lesson where we will continue to build on these foundations. Keep looking for those whispers, and I will talk to you soon.
