Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you’ve joined me for this lab. Today, we are diving into one of the most important, yet often overlooked, phases of the functional medicine journey. We’ve spent so much time in this certification talking about the "how" of healing—the protocols, the lab interpretations, the supplement cycles, and the intensive lifestyle overhauls. But today, we’re talking about the "forever." We’re talking about how we make these changes stick for the next thirty, forty, or fifty years.

This lab integrates everything we’ve covered in Module 5: Sustain. Our focus is on that critical, often delicate transition from intensive clinical intervention to long-term lifestyle maintenance. In my own practice, I’ve found that the "Sustain" phase is where true healing is actually cemented. It is the bridge between a "program" and a "life." 

If I’m being honest with you, this is often the scariest part for our clients. They’ve spent twelve or sixteen weeks with you. They’ve had your eyes on their food logs, your voice in their ears every week, and your guidance through every flare-up. They often fear that without your weekly presence, they’ll slide right back into the old patterns that made them sick in the first place. Today, I’m going to teach you how to empower them to become their own best advocate. You’re not just a coach anymore; you are building the foundation for their lifelong vitality.

In this lesson, we have four very specific goals. First, I want you to feel confident transitioning a client from intensive care to the maintenance phase. Second, we’re going to learn how to identify and implement what I call "Anchor Habits"—these are the non-negotiables that prevent a total relapse. Third, we’ll talk about how to address client anxiety regarding "going solo" by using specific, empowering language. And finally, we’ll look at how to use the Sustain Assessment Tool to measure whether a client is truly ready to fly on their own.

Let’s start with a scenario that I see almost every month in my practice. I want you to meet Sandra. Sandra is forty-eight years old. She’s an elementary school teacher in Austin, Texas. She’s actually a career-changer; she used to work in high-stress Corporate HR before moving into teaching. 

Now, Sandra has just completed your twelve-week "Root Cause Reset" program. And the results? They’ve been fantastic. Her fatigue has decreased by seventy percent. She’s lost twelve pounds of what we call inflammatory weight—that puffiness that just wouldn't budge before. Her brain fog, which used to make her feel like she was walking through a cloud at school, is now just a distant memory. 

But here’s the thing: as you sit down for your final session of this intensive phase, you notice Sandra is visibly nervous. She’s fidgeting with her pen. She isn’t celebrating. Finally, she looks at you and says, "I’m so happy with how I feel, but I’m terrified. What happens when I don’t have our weekly check-ins? I feel like I’ll just go back to my old ways during the next stressful week at school. I don't trust myself yet."

Does that sound familiar? It should. Because imposter syndrome isn’t just something we feel as coaches; our clients feel it too. Sandra is experiencing what I call "Safety Net Anxiety." She’s looking at you as the safety net that caught her. Your job today is to show her that the habits she’s built over the last three months are her new foundation. They aren't just a temporary structure you’ve been holding up for her; they are part of who she is now.

So, how do we build that "Maintenance Bridge"? I want to talk about a shift in your identity as a practitioner. During the first twelve weeks, you were a Coach. You were in the trenches. You were directing traffic. But in the Sustain phase, I want you to think of yourself more as a "Consultant." 

Think about the difference in those words. A coach is often perceived as someone who is necessary for the daily performance. But a consultant? A consultant is an expert advisor that a CEO calls upon to review strategy. By shifting your language to that of a consultant, you are implicitly telling the client: "You are now the CEO of your own health. You are in charge. I am here as your high-level advisor when you need a course correction." This builds their self-efficacy. It tells them that the power has shifted from your expertise to their daily actions.

Now, let’s get into the practical side of this. I want to talk about the 80/20 Maintenance Rule. In the intensive phase, we might have been at 95% or even 100% clinical adherence. We were strict because we needed to lower the total body burden of inflammation. But nobody lives at 100% forever. That’s not a life; that’s a prison. 

Research in the European Journal of Social Psychology actually shows that missing a single day of a new habit does not materially affect the habit-formation process. Perfection isn't the goal; consistency is. So, we teach Sandra the 80/20 rule. Eighty percent of the time, she follows the clinical protocols—the anti-inflammatory foods, the sleep hygiene, the movement. But twenty percent of the time, she has lifestyle flexibility. She can have the cake at the retirement party. She can stay up late watching a movie with her husband. This flexibility is actually what makes the lifestyle sustainable. If she feels she can never "fail," she’s much less likely to "quit."

Next, let's talk about "Anchor Habits." This is a concept I borrowed and adapted from the work of B.J. Fogg and his "Tiny Habits" research. When life gets chaotic—and for a teacher like Sandra, it will—her entire routine might fall apart. She might miss her gym session. She might eat lunch at her desk. But we need to identify one or two "Anchor Habits" that are her absolute baseline for safety. 

I often ask my clients this: "If life gets one hundred percent crazy next week, which one habit is your non-negotiable?" For some, it’s drinking seventy ounces of water. For others, it’s taking their magnesium before bed. For Sandra, maybe it’s just five minutes of deep breathing before she walks into her classroom. These anchors act as a physiological safety net. They keep the nervous system from spiraling into a full "relapse" mode.

I want to pause here for a second and talk to you about the business side of this, because I know what some of you are thinking. You’re thinking, "Sarah, if I move my clients to a maintenance model where I see them less often, won't my income drop?" 

I want to challenge that "scarcity" mindset. In reality, a client who stays with you for two years at a lower monthly rate for a "Maintenance Pulse" check-in is actually worth more to your business—and is much easier to manage—than constantly having to hunt for new, high-priced intensive clients. It creates what we call a "recurring revenue floor." It’s the difference between a feast-or-famine business and a stable, professional practice. Plus, these long-term clients become your best referral sources because they are the living proof that your methods work for the long haul.

Now, let's look at some of the common mistakes I see coaches make during this transition. If we can avoid these, Sandra’s transition will be much smoother.

The first mistake is "Over-Restricting." This is when a coach is too afraid to let go of the reins. They keep the client on a restrictive therapeutic diet for way too long. This leads to "diet fatigue." Eventually, the client rebels, eats everything in sight, feels like a failure, and disappears. We have to move toward that 80/20 rule to allow for social and emotional flexibility.

The second mistake is what I call "Ghosting the Client." This is the opposite of over-restricting. This is when the twelve-week program ends, and the coach just says, "Great job, call me if you need anything!" The client feels abandoned. They lose momentum because they don't have that next milestone on the calendar. My rule is: never finish an intensive program without the first "Maintenance Pulse" check-in already scheduled for four or six weeks out. It keeps the connection alive without the intensity.

The third mistake is ignoring "Seasonality." Habits that work in the calm of October often fail in the chaos of the holidays or the start of a new school year. For Sandra, we need to proactively plan for those stressors. We ask, "How will your routine change when report cards are due?" or "What’s our plan for the two weeks of Christmas break?" If we don't plan for the seasons, the seasons will break the habits.

And the final mistake—and this one is hard for our egos—is taking too much credit for the results. If Sandra says, "I feel great because of you," and you just say "Thank you," you are reinforcing her dependency. Instead, I want you to reflect that agency back to her. Say, "I provided the map, Sandra, but you’re the one who did the driving. You’re the one who chose the better foods when you were tired. You’re the one who prioritized your sleep." She needs to own her success so she can own her future.

For a client like Sandra, who is forty-eight, there’s another layer we have to consider: perimenopause. As her hormones begin to shift, her "maintenance" needs will shift too. We need to remind her that "Sustain" doesn't mean "Stay the same forever." It means having the tools to adapt. We aren't just sustaining her health today; we’re preparing her for the next decade of her life.

So, how do you know if it’s working? How do you know when a client is truly ready for the Sustain phase? We look for specific "Success Markers."

The first is an "Internal Locus of Control." You’ll hear this in her language. She’ll stop saying "You told me to eat more protein" and start saying "I noticed I felt so much more stable when I had that protein-rich breakfast." When she starts using "I" statements, you know she’s internalized the principles.

The second marker is "Bounce-Back Ability." In the beginning, a "bad" weekend where she ate gluten or stayed up late might have caused a total emotional spiral. But in the Sustain phase, she doesn't spiral. She just says, "That didn't feel great," and she returns to her Anchor Habits on Monday morning. She treats it as data, not a disaster.

The third is "Predictive Awareness." This is when the client can actually predict their symptoms based on their choices. Sandra might say, "I know if I stay up late tonight finishing these grades, my brain fog will be back tomorrow, so I’m going to make sure I have my anti-inflammatory smoothie ready to go." That level of self-awareness is the ultimate goal of functional medicine coaching.

And finally, look for "Goal Evolution." This is my favorite marker. This is when the client stops talking about surviving their symptoms and starts talking about thriving in their life. Sandra might start asking about training for a 5k, or taking up a new hobby, or traveling. She’s no longer defined by her illness; she’s defined by her possibilities.

I want to give you a few things to practice saying out loud. I know it sounds silly, but your tone matters so much here. You need to sound firm, encouraging, and steady. 

Try this validation prompt in the mirror: "Sandra, your fear is actually a sign of your success. It means you finally know what it feels like to be vibrant, and you never want to lose that again. That’s a powerful motivator. Let’s use that desire to build your sustainability plan together."

And practice asking the "Anchor Habit" question: "If life gets one hundred percent crazy next week, which one habit is your absolute baseline for safety? What is the one thing that keeps you grounded?"

As we wrap up today’s lab, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to hold onto. 

First, remember that the Sustain phase is about transitioning from "repair" to "resilience." We’ve fixed the immediate issues; now we’re building a system that can handle the hits that life will inevitably throw.

Second, Anchor Habits are your client’s physiological safety net. They don't need a hundred habits; they need three or four that they never, ever drop.

Third, success in this phase is measured by the client’s ability to self-correct without shame. Shame is the enemy of sustainability. Resilience is the goal.

And finally, remember that evolving your role from "Coach" to "Consultant" is a gift to your client. It empowers them. It gives them the keys to the car. 

You are becoming a truly great coach when you can let go of the client’s hand and watch them walk confidently on their own. It’s a bit like being a parent; the goal is to make yourself unnecessary.

Let’s quickly reflect on what we’ve covered. Think about Sandra. What was her primary psychological challenge? It was that "Safety Net Anxiety," right? And how did we address it? We used empowering language, we identified her Anchor Habits, and we moved her toward the 80/20 rule. 

Why are those Anchor Habits better than demanding full adherence? Because full adherence is brittle. It breaks under pressure. Anchor Habits are flexible; they allow the client to stay connected to their health even when the rest of their routine is a mess.

And if a client tells you they are terrified of finishing the program, remember: that’s your opening. Don't just reassure them; use it as a bridge to build their plan. Validate the fear, then pivot to the strategy.

One last thing: people often ask if they should stop all supplement recommendations in the Sustain phase. The answer is: it depends. But usually, we move from "therapeutic" doses to "maintenance" doses. We want the body to do as much of the work as possible on its own, using supplements only as a targeted support system when needed.

You’ve done incredible work today. This transition phase is where the "magic" of functional medicine becomes a "miracle" of long-term health. By mastering the Sustain phase, you aren't just helping people get well; you’re helping them stay well for a lifetime.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
