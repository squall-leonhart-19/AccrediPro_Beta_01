Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here with me today. In our previous modules, we’ve spent a lot of time talking about the Target phase. Those are the intense, often aggressive protocols where we’re going after pathogens, clearing out heavy metals, and really pushing the body to detoxify deep-seated burdens. But today, we’re shifting our focus to something just as critical, if not more so for long-term health: the Sustain phase.

In this phase, our goal moves from active clearance to long-term prevention. We want to ensure that once we’ve cleared the path to health, your client doesn't find themselves right back where they started. To do that, we have to talk about the Total Toxic Burden and how to build what I call a Functional Home. This is about creating a lifestyle that minimizes toxic entry and maximizes cellular resilience every single day.

Think about the world we live in. It’s estimated that there are over 80,000 chemicals in our environment today that simply did not exist 100 years ago. For our clients, especially those in that 40 to 55 age bracket who are already navigating significant hormonal shifts like perimenopause or andropause, managing this environmental load isn't just a nice-to-have wellness habit. It is a clinical necessity. When hormones are fluctuating, the body’s ability to process external stress and chemical exposure changes. Today, we’re moving beyond the idea of a simple "ten-day detox" and into the actual architecture of a lifestyle.

In this lesson, I’m going to walk you through five key areas. First, we’ll look at the Total Toxic Burden framework. Then, we’ll dive into the Functional Home, focusing on air, water, and surface purity. We’ll talk about EMF hygiene and digital health. We’ll explore the deep connection between regenerative agriculture and human nutrient density. And finally, we’ll discuss how to align our lives with circadian and seasonal rhythms.

Let’s start with that framework of the Total Toxic Burden. In Functional Medicine, we love the analogy of the toxic bucket. Imagine every client is born with a bucket. Now, the size of that bucket is determined largely by their genetics. Some people are born with a massive five-gallon bucket. They can handle a lot of environmental stress before they ever feel a symptom. Others are born with a small teacup. They are what we often call the "canaries in the coal mine." They react to everything.

Throughout our lives, we are constantly pouring "water" into that bucket. That water comes in the form of heavy metals from our food, mold from our homes, pesticides from our lawns, and even the metabolic waste our own bodies produce. Here is the key takeaway: symptoms don't usually arise because of one single exposure. We don't get sick because of one plastic water bottle or one day of breathing city air. We get sick when the bucket overflows.

A very important study was published in 2023 in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. They looked at over 12,000 people and found that cumulative exposure to even low-level environmental pollutants was significantly correlated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. This is a huge point to share with your clients. The goal isn't zero exposure. In our modern world, that’s impossible and trying to achieve it will only cause more stress. The goal is to keep the bucket at a manageable level so the body’s natural biotransformation pathways—the liver, the kidneys, the skin, and the lungs—can keep up with the inflow.

Now, as a practitioner, this gives you a unique business opportunity. I’ve seen many coaches, like Sarah, a former nurse who transitioned into functional coaching, add what she calls "Environmental Home Audits" to her high-ticket packages. She charges several hundred dollars for a virtual walkthrough where she helps clients look at their pantry, their cleaning closet, and their bedroom. This provides massive value because you’re helping them stop the "leak" in their bucket at the source. It’s a way to increase your revenue while providing a service that actually makes their protocols more effective.

Let’s move into the specifics of the Functional Home. Did you know the average American spends about 90% of their time indoors? And yet, the air inside our homes can be two to five times more polluted than the air outside. To sustain health, the home has to become a sanctuary.

When we talk about air filtration, we have to look at two things: Particulate Matter, or PM2.5, and Volatile Organic Compounds, which we call VOCs. Most standard HVAC filters just aren't enough. I always recommend a two-pronged approach. First, you need a high-quality HEPA filter. This is the gold standard for capturing 99.97% of particles like dust, pollen, and mold spores. But HEPA filters don't always catch VOCs or viruses. That’s where PECO technology comes in. PECO stands for Photo Electrochemical Oxidation. It actually neutralizes those smaller gaseous pollutants that HEPA might miss.

But even more important than filtration is source control. The single most effective thing your client can do to lower their indoor toxic load is to remove "fragrance" from the home. When you see the word "fragrance" or "parfum" on a label, it’s often a cocktail of phthalates, which are potent endocrine disruptors. Swapping out scented candles, plug-in air fresheners, and conventional laundry detergents for fragrance-free or essential oil-based alternatives can drop a client’s VOC exposure overnight.

Next, let’s talk about water. We cannot talk about sustainability without talking about water purity. A 2022 meta-analysis confirmed that "forever chemicals," known as PFAS, are present in the drinking water of over 200 million Americans. These chemicals are called "forever" because they don't break down in the environment or in our bodies. They are particularly hard on the thyroid and the HPA axis.

When you’re guiding a client on water filtration, you’ll see a few options. Basic activated carbon filters, like the ones in those common pitchers, are okay for improving taste and removing some chlorine, but they don't touch PFAS or fluoride. Reverse Osmosis, or RO, is much more effective. It can remove PFAS, fluoride, lead, and arsenic. However, keep in mind that RO also removes the good minerals. So, if your client uses RO, you must teach them how to remineralize their water with a pinch of sea salt or mineral drops. Distillation is the highest level of purity, but it’s often less practical for a whole family. For most clients in the Sustain phase, a high-quality RO system is the sweet spot.

Now, I want to pivot to a topic that is becoming increasingly important in our digital age: EMF hygiene. We’re talking about non-ionizing radiation from Wi-Fi, cell towers, and Bluetooth. While there is a lot of debate in the mainstream about the "thermal effect" of these frequencies, in the functional medicine world, we look at the biological effect. Research, particularly by Dr. Martin Pall, has shown that EMFs can activate what we call Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels, or VGCCs, in our cells. When these channels are over-activated, it leads to an influx of calcium into the cell, which triggers oxidative stress and can impair mitochondrial function.

Let me tell you about a client named Elena to show you how this looks in the real world. Elena was a 51-year-old corporate executive. She came to me with treatment-resistant insomnia, terrible morning brain fog, and a lot of perimenopausal anxiety. Her labs were actually okay—nothing was majorly "wrong," but she felt terrible. Instead of putting her on more supplements, we focused on her environment. We implemented a "Functional Bedroom" protocol. We put her Wi-Fi router on a simple ten-dollar timer so it turned off automatically at 10 PM. We had her put her phone in airplane mode and leave it in the kitchen, not on her nightstand. And we had her replace her smart-watch with a traditional mechanical one.

The results were incredible. Within just 14 days, Elena reported a 40% improvement in her sleep quality, which she was tracking on her Oura ring. Her morning cortisol spikes leveled out, and her anxiety began to lift. The best part? The total cost to her was zero dollars. This is the power of the Sustain phase. Sometimes the best "supplement" is simply removing a biological stressor.

This leads us naturally into the conversation about where our food comes from. Sustainability isn't just about avoiding toxins; it’s about maximizing nutrient density. The next frontier in Functional Medicine is the link between the soil microbiome and the human gut microbiome. We are seeing more and more evidence that regenerative agriculture—farming practices that actually restore the health of the soil—produces food with significantly higher phytochemical content.

A study comparing regenerative versus conventional crops found that regenerative beef and pork had much higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids and a much better omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. For a client in the Sustain phase, sourcing from these types of farms ensures they are getting the exact micronutrients required for their liver’s biotransformation enzymes, like the Cytochrome P450 system, to work at their best.

I always teach my clients about the Environmental Working Group’s "Clean 15" and "Dirty Dozen" lists, which help them know which produce to buy organic. But I encourage you to go deeper with your clients. Help them find a local farmer's market. Encourage them to ask farmers about "no-till" practices or "cover cropping." Not only does this get them better food, but it builds a sense of community. And as we know, social connection is a huge pillar of health in the Sustain phase.

Finally, let’s talk about living in alignment with the natural world. The human body is truly an extension of its environment. Our genes are programmed to respond to light and dark cycles and the shifting of the seasons. When we ignore these cycles—like by staying up late under bright blue lights in the middle of winter—we create what I call "biological friction." This friction leads to chronic, low-grade inflammation.

One of the most important systems to understand here is the glymphatic system. You can think of this as the brain’s waste clearance system. It’s like a "nightly car wash" for your brain. But here’s the catch: the glymphatic system is only active during deep sleep. If a client is exposed to blue light after sunset, it suppresses their melatonin production. Now, we often think of melatonin just as a sleep hormone, but it’s actually a master mitochondrial antioxidant. Without enough melatonin, the brain cannot "clean" itself effectively at night. This is why light hygiene—using amber-colored glasses in the evening or dimming the lights—is a clinical intervention for long-term brain health.

We also have to look at seasonal adjustments. Our ancestors didn't eat the same way in December as they did in July. In the winter, it’s natural to focus on "storage" foods like roots and tubers, to eat a bit more healthy fat, and to sleep longer to mirror the shorter days. In the summer, our bodies can handle a higher carbohydrate intake from seasonal fruits, and we naturally have more energy for social and physical activity. Teaching your clients to flow with these seasons reduces the "stress" of trying to maintain a rigid, year-round routine.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a very important reminder. Please, don't let your clients become "orthorexic" about their environment. Stress itself is a potent toxin. If a client becomes so afraid of a Wi-Fi signal or a non-organic apple that they can't enjoy their life, the stress of that fear might be doing more damage than the exposure itself.

We always aim for the 80/20 rule. We want to control the home environment strictly—that’s the 80%. We make the home a sanctuary so that when the client goes out into the "uncontrollable" world—the other 20%—their body has the resilience and the "bucket space" to handle it with ease.

So, let’s summarize the key takeaways for the Sustain phase. First, focus on reducing the "inflow" of toxins into the bucket by addressing air, water, and food sourcing. Second, prioritize the bedroom as a sanctuary for EMF and light hygiene to protect that vital glymphatic clearance. Third, advocate for regenerative agriculture to ensure the highest nutrient density. Fourth, align lifestyle habits with circadian and seasonal cycles to support endocrine health. And finally, always choose practicality over perfection.

Your role in the Sustain phase is to be a guide to a resilient life. You’re helping your clients build a foundation that will support them for decades to come.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
