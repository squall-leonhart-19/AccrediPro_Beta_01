Hi, it's Sarah. I’m so glad you’re here with me today. We’ve spent so much of our time together talking about the "Reveal" phase—that intense, investigative period where we’re digging deep into the roots of a client’s symptoms. We’re looking for the why. We’re looking for the triggers. But today, we’re shifting gears into something just as important, though it often gets less attention in the functional medicine world. We are moving into the "Sustain" phase.

In this phase, your role changes. You are moving from being an investigator to being a curator. You are now the curator of your client’s long-term physiological stability. Think about that for a second. It’s one thing to help someone feel better after years of chronic fatigue or gut issues. It’s another thing entirely to ensure they stay that way for the next twenty, thirty, or forty years. True health sovereignty isn't a one-time achievement. It is a continuous process of objective monitoring. We don't just "fix and forget" in this practice. We use data to confirm that our interventions are actually holding.

In our time together today, I want to teach you how to design a monitoring schedule that actually works. We want to maintain these incredible results without causing what I call "testing fatigue." We’ve all seen it—the client who is so burned out by labs and finger pricks that they just stop caring. We’re going to avoid that. I’m also going to show you how to use modern technology, like wearables, to catch what I call "subclinical shifts." These are the tiny movements in biology that happen long before a symptom ever returns.

By the time we finish this lesson, you’ll be able to do five very specific things. First, you’ll know how to establish a scientifically sound cadence for follow-up testing. Second, you’ll be able to identify what I call the "Surveillance Trio"—the three most critical biomarkers for long-term health. Third, you’ll learn how to integrate things like HRV and CGMs into your maintenance protocols. Fourth, you’ll learn to recognize "Biomarker Drift" before it turns into a relapse. And finally, I’m going to show you how to structure a high-value Annual Functional Check-up that keeps your clients safe and your practice thriving.

Let’s start with the big question: "How often should I re-test my clients?" This is probably the most common question I get from new practitioners. If you test too often, it’s expensive and stressful for the client. If you test too rarely, you’re flying blind. You might miss a physiological slide until it’s too late. When we are in the "Target" phase, we’re usually on aggressive 90-day cycles. But in the Sustain phase, we slow down. We move into a more sustainable rhythm.

A major retrospective study from 2022 looked at metabolic health interventions. It suggested that once we reach physiological stability, a six to twelve-month re-testing interval is actually optimal for most biomarkers. This assumes, of course, that the client remains asymptomatic. But the timing really depends on which "node" of the Functional Medicine Matrix we’re looking at.

For metabolic markers, like HbA1c and fasting insulin, I like to see those every six months. These markers reflect long-term glucose trends and insulin sensitivity. They change relatively slowly, so checking them twice a year gives us a beautiful trend line. Now, if we look at the microbiome—maybe you’ve done a GI Map or a similar stool test—you don’t need to do that every few months once the dysbiosis is resolved. An annual check is usually plenty to ensure that microbial diversity is staying where it should be.

Inflammation is different. I use hs-CRP as an early warning system. If a client is very stable, every six to twelve months is fine. But if they have a history of autoimmune flares, we might stay on that six-month cadence just to be safe. And finally, nutrient status. If you’ve put a client on a maintenance dose of Vitamin D or B12, checking those once a year is usually enough to ensure those doses are actually meeting their cellular needs.

I want to tell you about a practitioner I know named Susan. Susan was a nurse for twenty years before she transitioned into functional medicine coaching. When she first started her practice, she struggled with "one-and-done" clients. They would do a 90-day program, feel better, and leave. She was constantly on the marketing treadmill trying to find new people. But when she started implementing the Sustain phase, everything changed. She built what she calls "Maintenance Memberships." These include bi-annual lab reviews and a monthly check-in. She provides peace of mind for her clients, and it secured her a stable income of about $4,500 a month just from her existing client base. She stopped hunting for new leads and started nurturing her "alumni." That is the power of a good re-testing cadence.

Now, let’s talk about what we are actually looking for. In the Sustain phase, we focus on the "Vital Few." We aren’t doing 50-page lab panels anymore. We are looking for systemic resilience. And remember, we are looking for "Optimal" ranges, not just the absence of disease. The "Normal" lab range is based on a bell curve of a sick population. We want more for our clients.

The first pillar of our Surveillance Trio is Glycemic Control. Metabolic flexibility is truly the cornerstone of longevity. If you can’t manage your blood sugar, you can’t manage your health. We monitor Fasting Insulin and HbA1c. Now, here is the secret: we want that Fasting Insulin to be between 2 and 5 uIU/mL. Most labs will tell you that anything under 20 is "normal." That is a huge mistake. If I see a client’s fasting insulin starting to climb to 8, 9, or 10, but their HbA1c is still a "perfect" 5.1%, I know they are drifting. Their body is having to pump out massive amounts of insulin just to keep that blood sugar stable. We are catching insulin resistance years—sometimes a decade—before a conventional doctor would notice.

The second pillar is the Inflammatory Load. Our primary tool here is high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, or hs-CRP. There was a massive meta-analysis of over 40,000 participants that confirmed something we’ve known in functional medicine for a long time. If your hs-CRP is under 1.0 mg/L, your risk for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality drops significantly. This is our "check engine" light. If that number creeps above 1.5 and there hasn’t been a recent injury or a cold, we have to go back to our Reveal nodes. Is it the gut? Is it hidden stress? Is it a new environmental toxin?

The third pillar is Advanced Lipid Fractionation. Please, move beyond total cholesterol. It tells us almost nothing about actual risk. In the Sustain phase, we want to look at ApoB and LDL-P, which is the particle number. These give us a much more accurate picture of atherogenic risk. This is especially vital for women in peri-menopause and menopause. Hormonal shifts can cause lipid profiles to change almost overnight. If we aren’t looking at the right markers, we’ll miss the window to intervene naturally.

I have a case study that perfectly illustrates why this matters. Meet Elena. She’s 49, a high-level marketing executive. She came to me originally with Hashimoto’s and terrible brain fog. We spent six months in the Target phase and she did amazing. Her symptoms resolved, her antibodies dropped, and she felt like herself again. She moved into the Sustain phase with a plan to check her labs twice a year.

At her 12-month check-up, Elena told me she felt "fine." If I had just asked her how she felt, I would have sent her on her way. But we ran her surveillance panel. Her hs-CRP had jumped from 0.4 to 2.1. Her fasting insulin had doubled, moving from 4.2 to 8.9. When we sat down to look at these numbers, the truth came out. She had started a massive, high-stress project at work. She was staying up late and "treating herself" to processed snacks in the evening to cope with the stress. Because we had objective monitoring, we caught that metabolic slide before her thyroid antibodies flared back up. We caught it before the brain fog returned. We did two months of stress management and dietary course-correction, and her markers went right back to optimal. We avoided a full-blown relapse because we weren’t just guessing.

This leads me to a really exciting part of the Sustain phase: Wearable Technology. If blood work is a "snapshot" in time—like a single photo—wearables are the "movie" of a client’s life. They give us real-time feedback.

The first tool I love is the Continuous Glucose Monitor, or CGM. For a long time, these were only for diabetics. But now, they are an incredible tool for anyone. I often suggest a 2-week CGM "sprint" once a year for my maintenance clients. It allows them to see exactly how their unique biology responds to things. Maybe they think oatmeal is a "healthy" breakfast, but the CGM shows their blood sugar spiking to 160. That is data they can’t argue with. It recalibrates their choices in a way that no lecture from a coach ever could.

The second tool is Heart Rate Variability, or HRV. This is a proxy for the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It tells us about the "fight or flight" versus "rest and digest" balance. I tell my clients not to obsess over the daily number, but to look at the trend. If we see a downward trend in baseline HRV over a week or two, it’s a leading indicator. It means they are overtraining, they’re about to get sick, or they have hidden psychological stress that they haven’t admitted to themselves yet.

Don’t let "tech overwhelm" stop you from using these tools. You don’t need to be a data scientist. You just need to teach your clients to look for trends. In the Sustain phase, we want to see a stable or slightly increasing HRV trend over months. That indicates improved vagal tone and true physiological resilience.

Now, let’s talk about a concept that is central to everything we do in the Sustain phase: "Biomarker Drift." This is the phenomenon where markers begin to move toward the "standard lab range" and away from our "functional optimal range." The client usually feels fine during this time. We call this the Subclinical Window.

Research shows that for many chronic conditions, like Type 2 Diabetes or Heart Disease, these markers start to "drift" three to seven years before a clinical diagnosis is actually made. Think about that. Seven years of warning. As a Functional Practitioner, you are that early-warning system. You are the one standing on the watchtower.

When I explain "Drift" to a client, I always use the Car Alignment Analogy. I say, "Your body is like a high-performance car. If the alignment is just slightly off, you might not feel it when you’re driving down the street today. But if you drive ten thousand miles like that, you’re going to ruin your tires and put stress on the whole frame. Re-testing is our way of checking the alignment. We want to make a small adjustment now so we don't have to replace the whole engine later." Clients get that. It makes the investment in labs feel like a smart maintenance cost rather than an unnecessary expense.

This brings us to the pinnacle of the Sustain phase: The Annual Functional Check-Up. In conventional medicine, the "Annual Physical" is often just a five-minute conversation and a very basic blood panel that looks for overt disease. The Functional Check-Up is different. It is a deep-dive into the R.O.O.T.S. Method™ to ensure the foundation is still solid.

This is a high-value service that really differentiates your practice. Your Annual Check-Up Framework should include five things. First, an updated Clinical Timeline. Have there been new stressors? A move? A job change? A loss? Second, a Functional Matrix Review. We look at all seven nodes—from gut to hormones to detox—and make sure they are still in balance. Third, the Surveillance Lab Panel. This is that complete blood chemistry with functional interpretation we talked about. Fourth, a Lifestyle Audit. We review their sleep architecture, their movement patterns, and their nutrient density. And finally, Protocol Refinement. This is where we look at their supplements and see what can be stripped away. We want them on "maintenance" levels, not "therapeutic" levels forever.

I recommend pricing your Annual Functional Check-up as a standalone premium service. Somewhere in the range of $497 to $797 is usually the sweet spot. This allows you to re-engage past clients who might have finished their initial programs months or even years ago. I have another colleague, Maria, who left a corporate HR job to start her practice. She uses these check-ups to get a seasonal "boost" to her income every January and September. It’s a win-win. Her clients feel taken care of, and her business has a predictable, recurring revenue stream.

Before we wrap up, I want to do a quick check of what we’ve covered. I’m going to ask you a few questions, and I want you to think about the answers based on what we’ve discussed.

First, what is the recommended re-testing interval for most stable biomarkers in the Sustain phase? If you said six to twelve months, you’re right. That’s the rhythm that balances safety with sustainability.

Second, if a client’s Fasting Insulin is 9 but their HbA1c is a "perfect" 5.0%, what does that tell you? It tells you that "Biomarker Drift" is happening. Their body is overcompensating to maintain blood sugar, and you need to intervene now before that HbA1c starts to climb.

Third, which biomarker is our primary "early warning" tool for systemic inflammation? That’s the hs-CRP. And remember, we want to see it under 1.0 for optimal health.

And finally, how does HRV assist us in the Sustain phase? It acts as our "movie" of the nervous system. It helps us catch overtraining or hidden stress in real-time, often before the client even realizes they are pushing too hard.

As we close out this lesson, I want you to remember these five key takeaways.

Number one: Data prevents relapse. Objective monitoring catches those subclinical "drifts" long before a client feels symptomatic. We don't wait for the fire to start; we look for the smoke.

Number two: Always prioritize Optimal over Normal. In the Sustain phase, we aren't just looking for the absence of disease. We are aiming for functional ranges that ensure a long, healthy healthspan.

Number three: Focus your re-testing budget on the Surveillance Trio. If a client has limited funds, keep your eyes on Glycemic control, Inflammation, and Advanced Lipids. Those will give you the most "bang for your buck" in terms of risk assessment.

Number four: Use wearables as a tool for empowerment. CGMs and HRV monitors aren't just for data; they give your clients autonomy. They provide immediate biofeedback that reinforces the lifestyle choices you’ve taught them.

And number five: Strategic re-testing and Annual Check-ups aren't just good for the client; they are good for your practice. They create a professional, high-value framework for long-term relationships. You aren't just a coach they saw once; you are their partner in lifelong health.

The Sustain phase is where the "miracles" of functional medicine are protected. It’s where we ensure that the hard work your clients did in the Reveal and Target phases actually lasts a lifetime. You are now equipped to be that curator. You have the tools to monitor, the knowledge to interpret, and the framework to build a sustainable, impactful practice.

Great work today. I am so proud of the progress you’re making. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
