            "question": "What is the primary philosophical shift required when moving from the 'Resolve' phase to the 'Sustain' phase in Functional Medicine?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the dosage of all supplements to prevent relapse",
                "Transitioning from practitioner-led intervention to patient-led health autonomy",
                "Focusing exclusively on genomic testing rather than clinical symptoms",
                "Returning the patient to their pre-illness lifestyle and diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sustain phase focuses on empowering the patient to become the primary driver of their health, moving away from intensive practitioner-led protocols toward long-term autonomy and self-management."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered a 'gold standard' for monitoring long-term glycemic control and glycation end-products during the Sustain phase?",
            "options": [
                "Post-prandial insulin (30 minutes)",
                "Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)",
                "Serum Uric Acid",
                "Total Cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HbA1c provides a 2-3 month average of blood glucose levels and is a critical objective marker for monitoring metabolic stability and the risk of glycation-related damage."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Metabolic Resilience,' what does the term 'Mitochondrial Hormesis' (Mitohormesis) refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The complete avoidance of oxidative stress to protect mitochondrial DNA",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mitohormesis is the concept that brief, controlled bursts of ROS (reactive oxygen species) from stressors like exercise or fasting actually strengthen mitochondrial function and cellular defense mechanisms."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Teach-Back' method used in Health Literacy (Lesson 4), how should a practitioner verify patient understanding?",

                "Administering a written multiple-choice test before the patient leaves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Teach-Back method is a research-validated tool where patients paraphrase instructions, ensuring they have accurately internalized the information and reducing the risk of non-adherence."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In B.J. Fogg's Behavior Model (B=MAP), which factor is often the easiest to adjust when a patient fails to perform a desired health habit?",

                "Motivation (increasing their 'why')",
                "Ability (making the task simpler)",
                "Mindset (changing their personality)",
                "Genetics (modifying SNP expression)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While motivation is volatile, 'Ability' (making the task easier) is the most reliable lever for habit formation. If a behavior isn't happening, the practitioner should first look to simplify the 'Tiny Habit'."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "A patient in the Sustain phase is concerned about 'Toxic Load.' Which Phase II detoxification pathway is specifically supported by the consumption of glucosinolates from cruciferous vegetables?",

                "Hydrolysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Which longevity signaling pathway is activated by nutrient scarcity (fasting) and is known to stimulate autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AMPK acts as a fuel sensor; when energy (ATP) is low, AMPK is activated, which inhibits mTOR and turns on cellular cleanup (autophagy) and energy production processes."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "When designing the 'Sustain Roadmap,' what is the recommended frequency for 'Strategic Re-Testing' of inflammatory markers (like hs-CRP) in a stable, asymptomatic patient?",

                "Every 2 weeks",
                "Every 6–12 months",
                "Every 5 years",
                "Testing is no longer required in the Sustain phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For a stable patient, annual or bi-annual (6-12 months) testing is the standard for the Sustain phase to catch subclinical shifts in inflammation or metabolic health before they manifest as symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A patient struggles to maintain their morning supplement routine. Using 'Habit Stacking,' which of the following is the best recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the patient to try harder and use a sticky note",
                "Pair the supplement intake immediately after a pre-existing habit, like pouring their morning coffee",
                "Switch the supplements to a nighttime routine to see if that's better",
                "Prescribe a higher dose so they only have to take it once a week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking anchors a new behavior (supplements) to an established 'anchor' habit (coffee), utilizing the existing neural circuitry of the established routine to ensure success."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark of 'Metabolic Inflexibility' that should be addressed during the Sustain phase?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to easily switch between burning carbohydrates and fats",
                "Stable energy levels during a 12-hour fast",
                "An inability to oxidize fatty acids during periods of low carbohydrate availability (leading to 'hangry' episodes)",
                "High levels of HDL cholesterol and low triglycerides"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolic inflexibility is the inability of the mitochondria to switch substrates (fuel sources) efficiently. Addressing this through hormetic stressors like TRF or zone 2 exercise is a key goal of longevity and sustainability."
