Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here with me today. In our last lesson, we really opened up the conversation about environmental antigens. We talked about how things in our world—toxins, pollutants, and even molecular mimicry—can start to confuse the immune system. But today, we are going to focus on the most frequent, most intimate exposure any of us has with the outside world. And that is food.

Think about it for a second. We eat several times a day. Every single time we take a bite, we are introducing foreign genetic material into our bodies. We’re asking our immune systems to make a critical decision. Is this friend, or is this foe? For many of your clients, their immune systems have lost the ability to tell the difference. They are living in a state of constant, low-grade civil war. 

Today, we’re moving way beyond simple peanut allergies. We’re going to look at the complex pathways of food sensitivity. These are the hidden drivers of chronic inflammation. This is often the "missing link" for clients who feel like they’re doing everything right but still can’t get well. 

As a practitioner, this is one of the most powerful tools you will ever have. When you can identify a client’s specific food triggers, you change their life. It’s that simple. I’ve seen people who have struggled with migraines for twenty years finally find relief in two weeks just by changing what’s on their plate. I’ve seen joint pain vanish and brain fog lift. 

But here is the catch. For many of your clients, the very foods they think are "healthy" are the ones causing the problem. They’re drinking green smoothies with spinach and almonds every morning, not realizing those specific foods are fueling their eczema or their fatigue. 

By the end of our time together today, you’re going to be able to do five very specific things. First, you’ll be able to explain the difference between a Type One IgE allergy and the delayed Type Three or Four sensitivities. This is a distinction most people, and even many doctors, get wrong. Second, we’re going to look at serum testing. We’ll talk about what it’s good for and, just as importantly, what its limits are. Third, we’re going to dive into the world of lectins and phytates. These are non-antibody triggers that can cause a lot of trouble. Fourth, I’m going to show you how to map these food reactivities onto our ROOTS Matrix. This is how you stay organized and see the "big picture" of a client's health. And finally, I’m going to walk you through the clinical gold standard: the three-phase Elimination-Provocation protocol.

Let’s start with the immunology. We need to understand the "why" before we get to the "how." In conventional medicine, when someone says "food allergy," they are almost always talking about a Type One Hypersensitivity. This is the IgE-mediated reaction. Think of this as the "fire alarm" of the immune system. It’s immediate. It happens in seconds or minutes. You eat a shrimp, and your throat starts to swell. You eat a peanut, and you break out in hives. This is driven by mast cell degranulation and the release of histamine. It is serious, it is life-threatening, and it is usually very obvious.

But in functional medicine, we spend most of our time looking at Type Three and Type Four Hypersensitivities. These are what we call food sensitivities or intolerances. These are much more subtle, but they are incredibly destructive over time. These reactions involve IgG and IgA antibodies. 

The biggest challenge with these is the timing. An IgG reaction is delayed. It can take anywhere from two hours to three full days for symptoms to show up. Imagine trying to figure out what you ate on Tuesday that is giving you a migraine on Thursday. It’s almost impossible without a system. This is why your clients are so frustrated. They can’t see the connection because the timeline is too long.

IgG reactions create what we call immune complexes. These complexes circulate in the blood and can land anywhere. If they land in the joints, the client gets aches. If they land in the brain, they get fog or depression. If they land in the skin, they get rashes. 

I always tell my students to ask one specific question during an intake: "Do you have any reactions that happen immediately?" If the client says yes—if they get hives or their throat feels tight—you need to refer them to an allergist immediately. We don’t "test" or "coach" through true IgE allergies. That is a medical safety issue. Our lane is the chronic, delayed stuff that conventional doctors often miss because they aren't looking for it.

Now, let’s talk about how we find these triggers. Serum IgG testing is a very hot topic. If you go online, you’ll see people arguing about it constantly. Some say it’s the best thing ever, and others say it’s a waste of money. The truth, as always, is somewhere in the middle.

Conventional allergists often argue that IgG antibodies just show "exposure." They say that if you have IgG antibodies to eggs, it just means you eat eggs. And to a point, they’re right. But in functional medicine, we look at it through the lens of "oral tolerance." 

If a client’s immune system is healthy and their gut barrier is strong, they should be able to eat a wide variety of foods without the immune system getting "loud." When we see high IgG levels to thirty or forty different foods, the problem isn't actually the food. The problem is Intestinal Permeability, or what we call Leaky Gut. 

If the gut lining is compromised, undigested food particles leak into the bloodstream. The immune system sees these particles, knows they don't belong there, and attacks. It starts making antibodies to everything the person is eating. So, if your client is reacting to everything on the test, don’t tell them to stop eating everything. Tell them we need to heal their gut. The antibodies are just a smoke signal telling us there is a fire in the basement.

However, serum testing can be incredibly useful for compliance. Some clients just won't believe you until they see it in black and white on a lab report. It also helps us find those "hidden" triggers. 

Let me tell you about Sarah. She was forty-six, a yoga instructor, and she lived what most people would call a "perfect" life. She ate a plant-based diet, she meditated, and she exercised. But she was miserable. She had chronic migraines and terrible eczema on her hands and face. She felt like a fraud because she was supposed to be a "wellness" expert but she felt so sick.

She was eating "healthy" staples every single day. Spinach, almonds, kale, quinoa. When we ran her IgG panel, we found something shocking. She had Stage Four reactivity—the highest possible level—to spinach and almonds. These were the two main ingredients in her daily "health" smoothie. 

She was literally poisoning herself with "superfoods" every morning. We removed the spinach and almonds for four weeks. Her migraines, which she’d had twice a week for years, stopped completely. Her eczema started to clear up within ten days. This is why we do this work. One person’s superfood is another person’s poison. You have to treat the individual, not the diet.

But we also have to remember that not all reactions involve antibodies. This is where we talk about lectins and phytates. These are what we call "anti-nutrients." Plants can’t run away from predators, so they’ve developed chemical warfare to protect themselves. 

Lectins are sugar-binding proteins found in things like beans, grains, and nightshades. They can be very "sticky." They bind to the lining of the small intestine and can actually break down the "brush border" where we absorb nutrients. This triggers the release of zonulin, which is the protein that opens up the tight junctions in the gut. In other words, lectins can cause leaky gut directly, even without an antibody response.

Phytates are similar. They bind to minerals like magnesium, calcium, and zinc, making them unavailable for us to absorb. For a client who is already struggling with inflammation, these can be the "last straw" for their immune system.

If you have a client who has tried going gluten-free and dairy-free but they still have joint pain or autoimmune flares, I want you to look at nightshades. These are tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and potatoes. They contain alkaloids that can be very inflammatory for the joints. It’s a common "hidden" trigger that people miss because they think a tomato is just a healthy vegetable.

Now, how do we stay organized with all this information? We use the ROOTS Method™ and the Functional Medicine Matrix. We don’t just give people a list of foods to avoid. We map it out so we can see the system.

In the "Organize" phase, we look at the Matrix nodes. Most food reactivity lives in the "Defense and Repair" node. This is where we track the immune response and the systemic inflammation. But we also have to look at the "Assimilation" node. This is the "why." Does the client have low stomach acid? Are they not producing enough enzymes to break down their proteins? If you don’t fix the digestion in the Assimilation node, they will just develop new sensitivities to whatever new foods they start eating.

We also look at the "Communication" node. Food triggers cause inflammation, and inflammation messes with hormones. It can drive insulin resistance or thyroid dysfunction. When you can show a client how their almond habit is actually affecting their thyroid or their blood sugar, your value as a practitioner goes through the roof. 

This is how professionals like Diane, one of our graduates, went from being a teacher to a high-level coach commanding over two hundred and fifty dollars an hour. She isn't just "giving a diet." She is explaining the "web" of how a client's body is functioning. She is treating a system, not a symptom.

So, how do we actually implement this? While labs are great, the Elimination-Provocation diet is still the clinical gold standard. It is the only way to get real-time biological data on how a food affects a specific person.

The protocol has three phases. Phase One is what I call "The Cleanse." This usually lasts twenty-one to twenty-eight days. We remove the "Big Eight" triggers: gluten, dairy, soy, corn, eggs, peanuts, shellfish, and refined sugar. 

For some clients, this feels like a lot. But I tell them, "We are just cooling down your immune system." We’re lowering the "antigenic load." Research shows that about seventy percent of chronic symptoms will improve just in this first phase. It’s a powerful way to show the client that they have control over how they feel.

Then we move to Phase Two: "The Reintroduction" or "The Provocation." This is the most important part, and it’s where most people mess up. You have to introduce one food at a time, every three days. 

The client eats the food, and then they watch. They have to be like a scientist. Does their mood shift? Do they get a headache? Does their digestion change? If they have a reaction, that food goes on the "No" list for now. They have to wait until they feel totally fine again before they test the next food.

Your job here is to be the "Clinical Anchor." Clients get excited because they feel good, and they want to eat everything at once. You have to slow them down. If they eat dairy and wheat on the same day and feel bad, we don't know which one caused it. We lose the data. This is the difference between a "diet" and a "discovery."

Finally, we have Phase Three: "Maintenance." This is about creating a personalized nutrition plan for the long term. We identify the "True Triggers"—the things they should probably never eat. And we identify "Conditional Triggers"—things they can have once in a while, or in small amounts, once their gut is healed. 

We also teach them about "rotation." We don’t want them eating the same five things every single day, because that is how new sensitivities start. Variety is the key to a resilient immune system.

Before we wrap up, let’s do a quick mental check to make sure you’ve got the big ideas. 

First, why is an IgG reaction so much harder for a client to figure out on their own? Remember, it’s that delay. When a reaction takes two or three days to show up, the "cause and effect" is invisible without a structured protocol.

Second, if a client’s test shows they are reacting to twenty-five different foods, what is the most likely root cause? It’s almost always Intestinal Permeability—Leaky Gut. The problem is the barrier, not the menu.

Third, what’s the minimum time for that initial elimination phase? We aim for twenty-one to twenty-eight days. That’s how long it takes for the immune system to really "reset" and for those circulating immune complexes to clear out.

And finally, how do things like lectins cause trouble if they aren't using the antibody pathway? They bind directly to the gut lining, causing physical damage and triggering the innate immune system. They bypass the "security guards" and go straight for the "walls."

I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to hold onto. 

Remember that IgE is immediate and life-threatening, while IgG and IgA are delayed and chronic. Most of the people who come to you will be suffering from those delayed pathways. 

Never forget that testing is just a tool, not a final diagnosis. A lab report is a snapshot in time. It tells us about the client’s relationship with food right now, but it can change as they heal.

Always look at the "Assimilation" node. If you don't address why the food isn't being digested properly or why the gut is leaky, you're just putting a band-aid on the problem.

And finally, trust the Elimination Diet. It is the gold standard for a reason. No lab test can replace the wisdom of a person’s own body when they remove a trigger and then bring it back.

You are doing such important work. By understanding these immune pathways, you are giving your clients the keys to their own health. You’re helping them move from being victims of their symptoms to being masters of their own vitality.

Great work today. Take some time to process this, and I’ll see you in the next lesson.
