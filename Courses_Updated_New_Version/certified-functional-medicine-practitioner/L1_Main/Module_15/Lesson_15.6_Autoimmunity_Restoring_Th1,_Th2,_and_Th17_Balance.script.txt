Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell here, and I am so glad you’ve joined me for this lesson. We are moving into some of the most profound territory in functional medicine. In our last session, we spent a lot of time looking at food reactivity and how those external triggers can set the immune system on high alert. But today, we’re going to step inside the body and look at the cellular orchestration itself. We’re going to talk about the dance of the T-cells.

If you’ve ever felt like autoimmunity is a bit of a mystery, you’re not alone. In the conventional world, it’s often described simply as the immune system "attacking itself," as if the body has suddenly become its own worst enemy for no reason. But in our world, in the world of Functional Medicine, we see it differently. We view autoimmunity not as a random attack, but as a loss of regulation. It’s a breakdown in the sophisticated checks and balances that are supposed to keep us safe.

In this lesson, I’m going to teach you how to identify the specific patterns—the Th1, Th2, and Th17 pathways—that drive tissue destruction. More importantly, I’m going to show you how to empower the "peacekeeper" cells, known as T-regulatory cells, to bring the whole system back into harmony. This is the kind of sophisticated work that really separates a general health coach from a true Functional Medicine expert. When you understand these pathways, you stop guessing and start targeting the root cause.

By the time we finish today, I want you to be able to do five things. First, you’ll be able to analyze the distinct roles of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells in autoimmune pathology. Second, you’ll evaluate exactly how T-regulatory cells maintain self-tolerance. Third, you’ll identify the specific nutritional triggers, like Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and Glutathione, that tell these cells what to do. Fourth, you’ll see how to apply our R.O.O.T.S. Method to complex cases like Hashimoto’s and Rheumatoid Arthritis. And finally, you’ll learn to interpret cytokine patterns so you can guide your clients with personalized supplement protocols that actually work.

So, let’s start with the foundation. For decades, the functional immunology model was built on a very simple idea: the Th1 and Th2 seesaw. Now, we know today that the immune system is much more complex than a simple two-sided scale, but this framework is still a vital starting point. It helps us understand how a client’s immune system is "skewed" or tilted in one direction.

Think of Th1 cells as the infantry of your cell-mediated immunity. These cells are designed to target intracellular pathogens—things like viruses and certain types of bacteria that hide inside your cells. They use heavy hitters like Interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha to get the job done. When Th1 is overactive, it often drives organ-specific autoimmunity. This is where we see conditions like Type 1 Diabetes, Psoriasis, or Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis. The immune system is essentially using its "anti-virus" software to attack the tissue of a specific organ.

On the other side of the seesaw, we have Th2, which governs humoral immunity. These cells focus on extracellular threats—things like parasites and allergens that are floating around outside the cells. Th2 cells work by stimulating B-cells to produce antibodies. When someone is Th2-dominant, they usually present with "atopic" conditions. You’ll see asthma, eczema, and severe environmental allergies. In the autoimmune world, Th2 dominance is often linked to systemic conditions like Lupus.

Now, here is a clinical pearl for you: many clients won’t stay on one side of that seesaw forever. They will "flip" back and forth depending on their toxic load or their stress levels. I’ve seen this so many times in my practice. You might have a client with Hashimoto’s, which is typically a Th1-dominant state, who suddenly develops severe seasonal allergies or a new skin rash. That’s a sign that their system is shifting into a Th2-dominant state. As a practitioner, you have to look for the total load on the system rather than just treating the symptom of the moment. If you only treat the allergies, you’re missing the fact that the entire immune system is unstable.

But the story doesn't end with Th1 and Th2. If those two are the seesaw, then Th17 cells are the firestarters. These cells were discovered more recently, and they changed everything we thought we knew about autoimmunity. Th17 cells produce a cytokine called Interleukin-17, or IL-17. This is a highly pro-inflammatory signal that recruits neutrophils and drives rapid, aggressive tissue destruction.

In fact, a major study published in Nature Reviews Immunology back in 2022 highlighted that Th17 cells are the primary drivers of some of the most difficult conditions we face, like Rheumatoid Arthritis and Multiple Sclerosis. Unlike Th1 or Th2, which can actually be protective and helpful in the right context, having an overabundance of Th17 is almost always a bad sign in our modern environment. It’s like having a fire that’s spread from the fireplace to the living room curtains.

So, what triggers this Th17 fire? There are three main culprits I want you to watch for. First is gut dysbiosis. We have clear research showing that specific bacteria, like Segmented Filamentous Bacteria and Klebsiella, can actually induce the body to create more Th17 cells. This is why we always look at the gut. Second is high salt intake. It sounds simple, but research suggests that high sodium levels activate an enzyme called SGK1, which promotes the maturation of these inflammatory Th17 cells. And third is chronic stress. While we think of cortisol as something that suppresses the immune system, over time, the body develops "cortisol resistance." When that happens, the brakes are removed, and Th17 is allowed to run unchecked.

This brings us to the "heroes" of our story: the T-regulatory cells, or Tregs. In a healthy immune system, these cells act as the quality control team or the peacekeepers. Their entire job is to watch the Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and tell them to stand down once a threat is gone. They produce anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-beta to calm the storm.

The problem we see in almost every case of autoimmunity is that Treg function is deficient. The peacekeepers have gone on strike, or they’ve been overwhelmed. Restoring Treg function is really the "holy grail" of functional immunology. Conventional medicine often tries to solve the problem by using steroids or biologics to suppress the "bad" inflammatory cells. But as a Functional Medicine specialist, your goal is different. We want to empower the "good" regulatory cells so the body can restore its own balance naturally.

When you master this, you help your clients avoid the heavy side effects of immunosuppressants. This is high-level work. Practitioners in our network who specialize in this kind of "Immune Resilience" often command fees of $400 or more per hour because they are providing real solutions for cases that conventional doctors have labeled "unsolvable."

So, how do we actually do it? How do we move a client from Th17 dominance back to Treg dominance? It comes down to providing the specific biochemical signals the immune system requires to make that shift. We focus on a trio of nutrients: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and Glutathione.

Let’s talk about Vitamin D first, because it is the master modulator. I tell my clients all the time that Vitamin D isn't really a vitamin; it’s a secosteroid hormone. It binds to receptors right on the T-cells. When Vitamin D levels are optimal, it directly inhibits the production of that inflammatory IL-17 and promotes the induction of the "peacekeeper" Treg cells. There was a powerful meta-analysis of 24 different studies that showed Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced autoimmune flares, but only when serum levels were kept above 50 nanograms per milliliter. In my practice, I often look for levels closer to 70 for my autoimmune clients.

Then we have Vitamin A, specifically in its active form, retinoic acid. Vitamin A works synergistically with Vitamin D. When the body has enough TGF-beta present, Vitamin A helps convert "naive" T-cells into Tregs. If a client is deficient in Vitamin A, those same naive cells are much more likely to turn into inflammatory Th17 cells instead. It’s like a fork in the road, and Vitamin A is the signpost pointing toward peace.

Finally, there’s Glutathione. I like to call this the "Redox Switch." The environment inside the cell determines its fate. If the cell is in a "reduced" state, which means it has high levels of glutathione, it favors the production of Tregs. But if the cell is in an "oxidized" state, meaning glutathione is low and oxidative stress is high, it favors the inflammatory Th1 and Th17 pathways. This is why the "Organize" node in our ROOTS Method, which covers biotransformation and detoxification, is so essential for immune health. You cannot fix the immune system if the cellular environment is toxic.

To see how this works in the real world, let’s look at a case study. I want to tell you about Elena. She was a 52-year-old former school teacher who came to see me with severe joint pain from Rheumatoid Arthritis, along with extreme fatigue and brain fog. Her Hashimoto’s was also flaring; her TPO antibodies were over 900, and her systemic inflammation marker, CRP, was very high at 8.4.

Using the ROOTS Method, we started with the "Reveal" phase. Functional testing showed she had a severe Vitamin D deficiency—her level was only 18. We also found high levels of Klebsiella in her stool, which we know is a major Th17 trigger. In the "Organize" phase, we mapped her symptoms to the Defense and Repair node and the Assimilation node. We realized her history of frequent antibiotic use as a teacher was the "antecedent" that led to her current gut dysbiosis.

Then we moved to the "Target" phase. We didn't just give her a generic protocol. We used high-dose Vitamin D3 with K2—about 10,000 units a day—to get her levels up to that 70 nanogram target. We used liposomal glutathione to shift her cellular redox state and botanical antimicrobials to clear out the Klebsiella that was fueling the Th17 fire.

The outcome was incredible. After six months, Elena’s joint pain was reduced by 80%. Her TPO antibodies dropped from 900 down to 120. But the best part was that she felt so clear-headed and energized that she actually went on to start her own health coaching practice. She earned $3,500 in her very first month by helping other women who were struggling just like she had been. That is the power of this work.

When you’re explaining these complex concepts to your own clients, I find it’s best to use analogies. I love the "Wildfire" analogy for Th17. I tell my clients, "Your immune system has set a wildfire to get rid of a small brush pile. Our goal isn't just to pour water on the fire to suppress it. Our goal is to hire more Park Rangers—those are your Treg cells—to manage the forest properly so the fire never gets out of control again." It helps them understand that we are building resilience, not just suppressing symptoms.

Before we wrap up, let's do a quick mental check of what we've covered. If I asked you which T-cell subset is responsible for rapid tissue destruction in RA, would you know it’s Th17? If I asked what the role of a Treg cell is, could you explain that they are the peacekeepers that produce IL-10? Can you visualize how Vitamin D and Vitamin A work together to point T-cells in the right direction? And do you see why glutathione is the switch that determines if a cell becomes a peacekeeper or a soldier? If you can answer those, you are well on your way to mastering this.

To summarize our key takeaways for today: First, remember the new paradigm. Autoimmunity isn't just a Th1/Th2 imbalance; it’s a failure of the Treg cells to control those Th17 wildfires. Second, always look for the Th17 triggers: gut dysbiosis like Klebsiella, high salt intake, and chronic stress. Third, remember your nutrient trio: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and Glutathione are the essential signals the body needs to create those peacekeeper cells. And finally, remember the ROOTS advantage. By addressing the gut through the Assimilation node and the redox state through the Biotransformation node, you can achieve results—like massive antibody reduction—that conventional medicine often thinks is impossible.

You are doing amazing work by diving into this level of detail. This knowledge is what will make you an invaluable resource for your clients. I am so proud of the progress you’re making. Keep leaning into the science, and keep focusing on the "why" behind the "what."

Great work today. I look forward to seeing you in the next lesson where we’ll continue to build your expertise. Until then, take care.
