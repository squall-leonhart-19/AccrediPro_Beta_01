            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "T-regulatory (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the immune system to prevent over-activation and autoimmunity."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the inflammatory cascade, which 'master switch' protein complex moves into the nucleus to trigger the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) is the primary transcription factor that orchestrates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in response to various stressors."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "A client presents with low Secretory IgA (sIgA) on a functional stool analysis. What is the most likely clinical implication of this finding?",
            "options": [
                "An overactive systemic Type I hypersensitivity (IgE) response",
                "Increased risk of Type IV delayed hypersensitivity",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Secretory IgA is the primary immunoglobulin of the mucosal immune system; low levels indicate a weakened mucosal barrier, making the client more vulnerable to pathogens and food antigens."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "The phenomenon where the immune system attacks host tissue because a foreign antigen (like gluten or a virus) shares a similar amino acid sequence with human tissue is known as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses a foreign antigen with self-tissue due to structural similarities, a key mechanism in the development of autoimmunity."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "When comparing IgE and IgG food reactivity, which statement is most accurate regarding the functional medicine approach?",
            "options": [
                "IgG reactions are immediate and involve histamine release from mast cells.",
                "IgG reactions are often delayed (hours to days), making them difficult to identify without testing or elimination diets.",
                "IgE testing is the gold standard for identifying chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation.",
                "IgA reactions are only relevant in the bloodstream and have no bearing on gut health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike IgE (Type I) reactions which are immediate, IgG (Type III/IV) reactions are delayed, contributing to chronic symptoms and systemic inflammation long after the food is consumed."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In patients with active autoimmune flares, functional testing often reveals a dominance of which T-helper cell pathway, often associated with tissue destruction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Th17 cells produce IL-17 and are highly pro-inflammatory; their over-activation is a hallmark of many autoimmune conditions and tissue damage."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs) differ from traditional anti-inflammatories (like NSAIDs) because they:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While NSAIDs block the initiation of inflammation, SPMs are lipid mediators that actively signal the 'switch-off' and resolution of the inflammatory process."

            "question": "Why are 'stealth pathogens' like Borrelia burgdorferi or Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) particularly challenging for the immune system to eradicate?",
            "options": [
                "They create protective biofilms and utilize intracellular niches to evade immune detection.",
                "They only infect individuals with a genetic absence of Natural Killer (NK) cells.",
                "They are too large for macrophages to engulf via phagocytosis.",
                "They transform into IgE antibodies to confuse the adaptive immune system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stealth pathogens employ various strategies, including biofilm formation and intracellular sequestration, to remain persistent in the host despite an active immune system."

            "question": "A client has a high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) of 4.5 mg/L and a Vitamin D level of 22 ng/mL. According to functional immunology principles, what is the first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe high-dose antibiotics to clear potential stealth pathogens.",
                "Ignore the hs-CRP as it is a non-specific marker.",
                "Address the Vitamin D deficiency to support VDR-mediated immune modulation and reduce systemic inflammation.",
                "Recommend an intensive exercise program to 'sweat out' the inflammation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D is a potent immune modulator that acts through the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) to dampen NF-κB and support Treg function; addressing deficiency is a foundational step in lowering systemic inflammation (hs-CRP)."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which of the following acts as a 'danger signal' or DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern) that can trigger the innate immune system even in the absence of an external pathogen?",
