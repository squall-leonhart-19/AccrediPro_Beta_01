Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here for Lesson 7. I want you to take a deep breath and really settle in, because today we are moving into some of the most transformative work you will do with your clients. In our last session, we spent a lot of time in the world of theory. We looked at the Th1, Th2, and Th17 balance. We talked about how the immune system can lose its way. It can feel a bit like a complex, microscopic dance, right? It’s fascinating, but as a practitioner, you need to know what to do when that dance turns into a chaotic scramble. 

Today, we are moving from the "why" to the "how." We are officially entering the Target phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™. This is where you start to see the magic happen in your practice. We are going to transition from understanding the imbalance to applying the specific nutraceutical tools that restore order and resolve chronic inflammation. Think of yourself as an immunological conductor. You aren't just handing out supplements like a retail clerk. You are precision-tuning the body’s most sophisticated defense systems. 

Your ability to select the right tool for the right immunological job is exactly what is going to separate you from the coaches who just use a one-size-fits-all approach. By the time we finish today, you’ll know how to stabilize mast cells. You’ll understand how to resolve inflammatory cascades instead of just masking them. And you’ll be able to support that delicate Th1 and Th2 seesaw using tools that are backed by solid science. 

We have a lot to cover. We’re going to look at the evidence-based dosing for what I call the Foundation Trinity. We’ll dive into the world of botanical immunomodulators like Astragalus and medicinal mushrooms. We will also tackle the complexities of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome using bioflavonoids. And finally, we’ll talk about the vital difference between suppression and resolution. This is perhaps the most important concept in functional immunology. It is the difference between putting a piece of tape over a check-engine light and actually fixing the engine. I want you to feel confident in these protocols. I want you to see the kind of results that make clients call you a miracle worker. So, let’s get started.

We always start with the foundation. In the R.O.O.T.S. Method™, we have a golden rule. We never jump to the fancy, exotic botanicals until we know the physiological baseline is secure. It is so tempting to reach for the newest herb you read about in a journal, but if the basic building blocks are missing, those herbs won't have a solid ground to work on. I call these building blocks the Immune Foundation Trinity. It consists of Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2, and Zinc. These are the most common deficiencies we see in chronic inflammatory states, and they are also the most impactful to correct.

Let’s start with Vitamin D3. I often tell my clients that Vitamin D isn't really a vitamin at all. It is actually a secosteroid hormone. It’s a messenger. It binds to the Vitamin D Receptor, or the VDR. These receptors are found on almost every single immune cell in the human body. That should tell you how important it is. If the receptor is there, the cell is waiting for instructions from Vitamin D. The research here is just incredible. A major meta-analysis from 2022, the VITAL trial, looked at thousands of people. They found that Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of developing an autoimmune disease by 22 percent. Think about that. A simple, inexpensive nutrient can lower the risk of life-altering illness by nearly a quarter. 

But here is where you provide value as a functional practitioner. In conventional medicine, a lab might say a level of 30 is "normal." But we aren't looking for "normal." We are looking for "optimal." For immune modulation, we want to see those levels between 50 and 80 nanograms per milliliter. This is the range where we see the best saturation of those receptors. This is the range where the body can actually produce those T-regulatory cells we talked about in the last lesson. Those are the peacekeeper cells. Without enough Vitamin D, the peacekeepers don't show up to work.

Now, here is a critical clinical pearl. You must never give high-dose Vitamin D3 alone. You always, always pair it with Vitamin K2, specifically in the MK-7 form. Think of Vitamin D as the nutrient that opens the doors to let calcium into the body. It’s great at absorbing it. But Vitamin D doesn't know where that calcium should go. Without K2, that calcium can end up in the wrong places. It can end up in the heart valves, the arteries, or the kidneys. Vitamin K2 is the traffic cop. It directs that calcium into the bones and the teeth where it belongs. It protects the soft tissues. A good rule of thumb for your protocols is 100 micrograms of K2 for every 5,000 units of D3. It’s a simple step that ensures safety and efficacy.

The third part of our trinity is Zinc. Zinc is the element of maturity for the immune system. I want you to think about the thymus gland. This is a small gland in the chest where your T-cells go to "school." They go there to learn how to identify enemies and how to leave your own tissues alone. This process is called maturation. If a client is deficient in Zinc, their thymus gland can actually shrink. Their T-cells don't graduate. They stay immature and confused. This leads to an immune system that is both weak against viruses and prone to attacking the self. On a lab, we want to see plasma or serum zinc between 90 and 110. If it’s lower than that, your client is likely struggling with thymic function. Correcting this is one of the fastest ways to help someone who "catches everything" that goes around.

Once we have that foundation built, we can look at botanicals. But we use a very specific category called immunomodulators. This is a term I want you to explain clearly to your clients. Most people think of "immune stimulants." They think of things that just "boost" the immune system. But if a client has an overactive immune system, like in autoimmunity, "boosting" it is the last thing we want to do. We don't want to throw gasoline on a fire. 

An immunomodulator is different. It’s more like a thermostat. If the room is too cold, the thermostat turns on the heat. If the room is too hot, it turns on the AC. It helps the system find its center. It creates balance. Astragalus is a classic example of this. It has been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years for a reason. It supports the bone marrow and helps the body produce a healthy number of white blood cells, but it doesn't push the system into overdrive.

Then we have the world of medicinal mushrooms. I’m talking about things like Reishi, Turkey Tail, and Shiitake. These are some of my favorite tools in the Target phase. These fungi contain complex polysaccharides called 1,3 and 1,6 beta-glucans. These molecules are fascinating. They have a very specific shape that binds to what we call Dectin-1 receptors on your macrophages and Natural Killer cells. When this binding happens, it "primes" the immune system. It’s like giving your immune cells a cup of coffee and a briefing. They become more alert. They become better at surveillance. But they don't cause a "cytokine storm." They don't trigger the massive inflammatory release that we worry about with stimulants. This makes medicinal mushrooms incredibly safe for long-term use, even for clients with very sensitive systems.

Let me tell you a story about how this looks in the real world. I had a client named Linda. She was 52 years old and had spent years as an educator. She was actually in the process of transitioning into health coaching herself, but she was stuck. She felt "constantly sick." Every time a student had a cold, she caught it. She had this heavy, lingering brain fog that made it hard for her to focus on her studies. When we looked at her labs, her Vitamin D was only 24. That’s quite low. We also saw that her Natural Killer cell activity was very sluggish. 

We didn't do anything overly complicated. We just applied the Target phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™. We started her on 5,000 units of D3 with K2. We gave her 30 milligrams of Zinc picolinate to support her thymus. And we added a dual-extracted blend of Reishi and Astragalus. We had her take 500 milligrams twice a day. 

The change in Linda was profound. Within eight weeks, her Vitamin D reached 58. She called me and said it was the first winter in a decade that she hadn't ended up on antibiotics for a respiratory infection. But the real win was her confidence. When that brain fog lifted and her energy returned, she finally felt like the expert she was. She actually launched her own coaching practice and started charging 250 dollars an hour. She could finally show up for her clients because she wasn't constantly worried about her own health. This is why we do this work. It’s about more than just moving a lab marker. It’s about restoring someone’s ability to live their purpose.

Now, I want to pivot to a topic that is becoming more and more common in our field. Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, or MCAS. In many cases of chronic inflammation, the primary problem isn't actually the T-cells. It’s the Mast Cells. I want you to imagine Mast Cells as the "sentinels" or the "security guards" of the immune system. They sit in your skin, your gut lining, and your airways, just waiting for a threat. When they see one, they release these tiny granules filled with chemicals. 

In a healthy person, this is a good thing. It helps fight off parasites and allergens. But in someone with MCAS, these security guards have become hyper-reactive. They are "trigger-happy." They start releasing a "soup" of over 200 different inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. This can cause a bewildering array of symptoms. One minute the client has hives, the next they have a migraine, and then they have sudden bloating or anxiety. It can feel very random to the client, but for us, we see the pattern.

To help these clients, we use a specific bioflavonoid protocol to stabilize the mast cell membrane. We want to make that membrane "tougher" so it doesn't "leak" so easily. Our primary tool here is Quercetin. Quercetin is a natural mast cell stabilizer. It’s incredibly effective if used correctly. I usually suggest 500 milligrams, taken two or three times a day. But here is the secret: it works best if taken about 20 minutes before a meal. This allows it to coat the gut lining and be ready before any food triggers arrive.

Another tool I love is Luteolin. Luteolin is a potent neuro-immunomodulator. What makes it special is its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. If you have a client who talks about "brain-on-fire" symptoms—intense brain fog, irritability, or light sensitivity—Luteolin is your go-to. And of course, we use Vitamin C. Vitamin C doesn't just support the immune system; it actually acts as a natural antihistamine. It helps the body break down the histamine molecules that are already circulating in the blood.

But I have to give you a very important coach tip here. You can give all the Quercetin in the world, but if your client is constantly pouring more histamine into their system, they won't feel better. We use the "Histamine Bucket" analogy. Everyone has a bucket. Some are big, some are small. Histamine comes from stress, from the environment, and from food. If the bucket overflows, you get symptoms. While we are using nutraceuticals to "plug the holes" in the bucket, we also need to stop the pouring. For the first 30 days of the Target phase, I always recommend a low-histamine diet. That means avoiding fermented foods like sauerkraut or kombucha for a while. It means skipping the aged cheeses and the leftovers. Fresh is best for these clients. Once the system calms down, we can start to expand the diet again.

This next concept is perhaps the most important thing I will say today. It’s the difference between suppression and resolution. Conventional medicine is built on suppression. If there is inflammation, the answer is usually an NSAID, like Ibuprofen or Naproxen. These drugs work by blocking the pathways that create inflammation. It’s like putting a lid on a boiling pot. It stops the steam from coming out, but the heat is still on.

Here is the problem: inflammation is actually a programmed process. It is supposed to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. When we suppress it with drugs, we often prevent the "end" from ever happening. We stop the body from ever truly healing. In Functional Medicine, we don't want to just suppress. We want to achieve Resolution. 

This is where SPMs come in. SPMs stand for Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators. These are absolutely fascinating. They are metabolites of the fish oils we already know, like EPA and DHA. But they are "further down" the metabolic chain. Think of them as the "cleanup crew" of the immune system. While standard fish oil is great for reducing the "heat," SPMs are the signals that tell the immune system to stop the attack and start the repair. They signal the macrophages to switch from "attack mode" to "cleanup mode." They help clear out debris and knit the tissues back together. 

A study from 2023 showed that SPM supplementation significantly reduced pain scores in people with chronic inflammatory arthritis. And they did it without the stomach issues or the kidney risks that come with Ibuprofen. When you use SPMs, you aren't just masking the pain. You are literally helping the body finish the job that the inflammation started. It is a much more elegant and effective way to handle chronic pain.

Finally, I want to talk about how we can actually "talk" to our genes. This is called epigenetic modulation. We used to think we were stuck with the genetic hand we were dealt, but we now know that our environment and our nutrients act like switches. We can turn "on" the genes for health and turn "off" the genes for inflammation. 

The two big heavy hitters here are Curcumin and Resveratrol. Curcumin, which comes from turmeric, is one of the most studied substances in the world. It is a potent modulator of NF-kappa-B. Now, that’s a big name, but I want you to remember it. NF-kappa-B is the "master switch" for inflammatory gene expression. When it’s turned on, the body is in a state of constant high alert. Curcumin helps flip that switch to "off." It inhibits multiple inflammatory enzymes at once. But a quick warning: standard turmeric powder is very poorly absorbed. For your clients, you must use a high-bioavailability version. Look for "phytosome" or "liposomal" versions. Research shows they can be absorbed up to 29 times better than standard powder. 

Then we have Resveratrol. You’ve probably heard of this one in relation to red wine or grape skins. It works by activating a group of proteins called Sirtuins, specifically SIRT1. These are often called "longevity genes." They help silence the genes that cause inflammation and they provide incredible support for the mitochondria, the power plants of the cells. When you combine Curcumin and Resveratrol, you are working at the very deepest level of the body’s operating system.

When you start mastering these protocols, you are going to see results that seem almost like miracles. I’ve seen practitioners who were struggling to find their niche suddenly become the "go-to" person in their town for complex cases. One of our Certified Functional Medicine Practitioners reported something incredible. She created a specialized "Inflammation Resolution" program. She priced it at nearly 1,500 dollars for a 12-week container. She was nervous about the price, but she sold it out within 48 hours. Why? Because her community was desperate for someone who understood the root cause. They didn't want another prescription for a steroid or a painkiller. They wanted to know why their body was on fire and how to put it out for good.

So, as we wrap up today, let’s go over your key takeaways. These are the four pillars of your Target phase strategy. 

First, optimize the foundation first. I cannot stress this enough. Ensure that Vitamin D3 is in that 50 to 80 nanogram range. Make sure Zinc status is addressed. If the foundation is shaky, the rest of your protocol won't reach its full potential. 

Second, stabilize the sentinels. If you see signs of reactivity, hives, or "brain-on-fire" symptoms, think of the mast cells. Use Quercetin and Luteolin to calm that hyper-reactivity. Remember to address the "histamine bucket" through diet at the same time.

Third, always aim for resolution. Shift your thinking away from just "blocking" inflammation. Use SPMs and high-dose Omega-3s to signal the body that it is safe to stop the attack and start the repair. This is how you get long-term results rather than temporary relief.

And finally, speak to the genes. Utilize the power of Curcumin and Resveratrol to downregulate the NF-kappa-B pathway at the epigenetic level. This is how we change the internal environment of the body.

You are doing such important work. By learning these precision tools, you are becoming a practitioner who doesn't just guess, but who assesses and targets with confidence. You are becoming the bridge between the latest science and the people who need it most. 

I am so proud of the progress you are making. Take some time to review these dosing strategies and think about which of your current clients might benefit from these "Resolution" protocols. I’ll be here waiting for you in the next lesson, where we’ll continue building your expertise. 

Great work today. See you in the next lesson.
