Hi, it’s Sarah. In this lesson, we are going to dive deep into one of the most critical transitions in the functional medicine coaching process. We’ve spent time in the Reveal phase. We’ve gathered the data. We’ve looked at the labs. We’ve listened to the history. But now, we enter the Target phase. This is where the magic happens. This is where we decide exactly where to start. This lab is designed to bridge that often-difficult gap between clinical theory and empathetic, effective client communication.

I want to start by being very honest with you. I remember exactly how it felt when I first started my practice. I had fifteen years of experience as a nurse under my belt. I knew the science. I understood the physiology. But when I sat down with my first few coaching clients, I was so worried about getting it right. I felt this immense pressure to prove my value. I thought that if I didn't give them every single answer right away, they wouldn't think I was worth the investment. So, what did I do? I gave them twenty different things to do at once. I gave them supplements, dietary changes, lifestyle shifts, sleep hygiene protocols, and stress management techniques. 

And you know what happened? They left the office looking completely overwhelmed. They looked like deer in headlights. And I left those sessions feeling absolutely exhausted. I realized very quickly that my value wasn't in the volume of information I could provide. My value was in my ability to filter that information. Today, we are practicing the art of Strategic Targeting. We are going to learn how to choose the Big Rocks. These are the specific interventions that will move the needle the most for your client. We’re also going to practice how to explain the "Why" behind these choices with a level of confidence that builds immediate trust.

In this lesson, I’m going to show you how to prioritize clinical interventions using that Big Rock methodology. We’ll practice explaining the rationale behind a targeted plan, even when you're dealing with a client who might be skeptical or just plain overwhelmed. We’re going to apply active listening techniques to ensure your client feels heard during this targeting process. We’ll also identify and correct what I call the Overwhelm Trap in coaching dialogue. Finally, we’ll work on developing that professional presence that builds the legitimacy and trust necessary for a high-level practice.

Let’s look at a specific scenario. I want you to meet Linda. Linda is fifty-two years old. She’s a former elementary school teacher from Sacramento. She’s currently in a major life transition, moving into a new career in real estate. When Linda came to see me, she was struggling. Her main complaints were persistent brain fog, afternoon fatigue that felt like hitting a wall, and some pretty significant digestive bloating. 

When we looked at her initial data, we saw a few things. Her High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, or hs-CRP, was at 3.2. That’s a clear marker of systemic inflammation. Her Vitamin D was low, sitting at 28. Her fasting glucose was 105, which is heading into that pre-diabetic range. And she had a history of H. pylori and frequent antibiotic use for sinus infections. 

Now, as a coach, it’s tempting to want to fix all of those numbers at once. You want to give her Vitamin D. You want to fix the glucose. You want to address the inflammation. But remember what I said about my early days? When I transitioned from nursing to coaching, I felt like I had to prove my worth by doing everything. But your value isn't in how many things you suggest. It's in the clarity of your focus. If you’re offering a fifteen-hundred-dollar program, that program is valuable because it removes the guesswork for Linda. It doesn't add more work to her already busy life; it simplifies her path to feeling better.

So, how do we talk to Linda about this? I want to walk you through a coaching script. I want you to imagine you are in the room with her. This is where you move from being the Investigator to being the Guide. 

You might say something like this: "Linda, I’ve spent a lot of time reviewing your history and your recent lab markers. I can see why you’ve been feeling so frustrated with that brain fog, especially while you’re trying to launch this new career. Based on everything we’ve looked at, I want us to start by targeting your gut health and your blood sugar stability. I know that sounds like two different things, but they are actually very closely linked."

Notice what happened there. I acknowledged her pain point—the brain fog. Then, I narrowed the focus. I didn't mention the Vitamin D yet. I didn't talk about the sinus infections yet. I chose the Big Rocks. 

In functional medicine, we always want to explain the mechanism simply. If I tell Linda we’re working on her gut, she might wonder why that helps her brain fog. I need to build that bridge for her. I might explain it like this: "The reason we’re starting with the gut is that your digestive system is often called your second brain. When there’s inflammation in the gut, like we see with your history and that CRP marker, it sends signals to the brain that can cause that foggy feeling. By calming the gut first, we’re actually clearing the path for your brain to get the fuel it needs."

This builds your legitimacy as a practitioner. There’s actually a 2022 study that showed client compliance increases by sixty-four percent when they understand the physiological 'why' behind a recommendation. When people understand how the "A" leads to "B," they are much more likely to stick with the plan.

Now, let's talk about your voice. It’s time to find your "Coach Voice." This isn't about being an untouchable authority figure. It’s about being a professional guide. I often suggest that my students record themselves on their phones. Listen back to how you sound. Do you sound like a peer who is just chatting, or do you sound like someone who has a map and knows the way out of the woods?

There are three key vocal techniques I want you to practice. The first is the Empathetic Pivot. It sounds like this: "I hear how frustrating the brain fog is, especially with your new career starting. That's exactly why we are targeting your digestive health first—to give your brain the fuel it needs." You are validating their feeling, and then immediately pivoting to the solution.

The second is the Boundary Setter. Sometimes a client will want to jump ahead. They might say, "But what about my hormones? Can we test my hormones?" You need to be able to say: "I know you're excited about the hormone testing, and we will get there. But to get the most accurate results, we need to stabilize your blood sugar first. Does that make sense?" You aren't saying no; you’re saying "not yet," and explaining why the sequence matters.

The third is the Confidence Builder. This is where you lean into your experience and the methodology. "We aren't going to guess, Linda. We are going to target the foundation. This is the same process I've used with dozens of women in your exact position." That "calm certainty" is incredibly healing for a client who has been feeling lost.

Let's look at the data on prioritization. Why does this matter so much? If you suggest ten supplements at once, you’re likely to run into "pill fatigue." The client gets overwhelmed, they miss doses, and then they feel guilty. But if you start with just two foundational supports, compliance stays high. 

The same goes for diet. If you demand a one-hundred-percent diet overhaul on day one, you’re setting the client up for failure. But if you target one specific inflammatory trigger—let’s say, gluten—it’s a sustainable habit change. There’s less "failure guilt" and more momentum. 

New coaches often focus only on the "loudest" symptom. If the client says "I have a headache," the coach wants to fix the headache. But the Target methodology teaches us to focus on the Root Cause system. We’re looking for long-term resolution, not just temporary relief. 

I want to remind you that women in the forty-to-fifty-five age bracket, like Linda, value their time more than almost anything else. They are often juggling careers, aging parents, and growing children. By being the practitioner who simplifies their life through targeting, you become a premium service. My clients don't pay me to add more things to their to-do list. They pay me to reduce their to-do list to the few things that actually matter.

Let’s talk about some of the common mistakes I see new coaches make. The first is the Information Dump. This happens when you’re nervous. You start explaining the entire Krebs cycle or the complex pathways of detoxification. You lose the client’s interest, and honestly, you lose their trust. They don’t need to know everything you know; they just need to know that you know it.

The second mistake is the "Yes-Man" Trap. This is when you let the client dictate the targets because you're afraid to lead. If a client insists on doing a heavy metal detox when they haven't had a bowel movement in three days, you have to be the leader. You have to explain why we need to open the drainage pathways first. 

The third mistake is a lack of pausing. Sometimes we get so caught up in our own explanation that we don't give the client space to process the decision. After you propose a target, stop. Let it sink in. Ask them how that feels to them.

And the fourth mistake is skipping the "Why." Never tell a client what to do without explaining how it fixes their specific pain point. If you want them to stop eating sugar, don't just say "sugar is bad." Say, "We’re going to reduce sugar for the next two weeks so that your energy levels stay stable throughout your real estate showings." That's a target with a purpose.

If you ever feel imposter syndrome creeping in, I want you to remember this: You have the map. The Functional Medicine Matrix is your map. Your client is currently lost in the woods. Even if you only know the next three steps on that map, you are still the guide they need. You don't have to see the end of the trail to lead them out of the current thicket.

So, let's check our understanding of these concepts. Think about why it’s so important to choose a Big Rock rather than addressing all symptoms at once. It’s about cognitive load and biological priority. If the body is under systemic stress, it can’t heal everything at once. We have to pick the system that is the biggest bottleneck.

What should you do if a client insists on a target that you know isn't the root cause? You use that Boundary Setter. You acknowledge their interest, but you explain the necessary sequence for success. You protect the client from wasting time and money on interventions that won't work yet.

And remember what we discussed about the "Second Brain." When a client has brain fog, we almost always look at the gut. Resolving gut inflammation is often the fastest way to clear the mental clouds.

So, what is a Success Marker in a targeting conversation? It’s when the client sighs with relief. It’s when they say, "Oh, I can do that." It’s when they move from a state of anxiety about their health to a state of focused action.

As we wrap up this lab, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways for your practice. First, targeting is leadership. Your clients are paying for your ability to prioritize their health journey. They are paying for your "no" as much as your "yes." 

Second, remember the Rule of Three. Never give a client more than three major targets at a time. Whether it’s three supplements, three dietary changes, or three lifestyle shifts—three is the limit for sustainable change.

Third, always connect the dots. Link your target to their specific pain point. If the target is sleep, and their pain point is weight gain, explain how cortisol and insulin are affected by those missed hours of rest.

Fourth, practice your vocal authority. Speak with a "calm certainty." It is one of the most healing frequencies you can offer a person in distress. Your voice should signal that you are not panicked by their symptoms.

And finally, focus on results over volume. One targeted intervention that the client actually does is worth infinitely more than ten perfect interventions that they ignore because they were too overwhelmed to start.

I’ve spent years refining this process, and I can tell you that when you get targeting right, your clients get better faster, and your practice becomes much more rewarding. You stop being a source of information and start being a catalyst for transformation.

Great work today. Spend some time practicing those vocal prompts, and I’ll see you in the next lesson.
