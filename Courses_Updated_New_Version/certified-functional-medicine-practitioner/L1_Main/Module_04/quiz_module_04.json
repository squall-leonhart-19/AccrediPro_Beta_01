            "question": "When transitioning from the 'Optimize' phase to the 'Target' phase in the ROOT methodology, what is the primary shift in clinical focus?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from broad lifestyle foundations to high-potency, specific therapeutic interventions",
                "Decreasing the dosage of all supplements to test the client's baseline resilience",
                "Focusing exclusively on emotional health while pausing all physiological protocols",
                "Eliminating all dietary restrictions to see which symptoms return"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Target phase moves beyond foundational 'Optimization' (sleep, hydration, basic diet) to address specific pathological drivers using targeted, high-potency protocols like antimicrobials or mitochondrial supports."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Microbiome), which specific compound is most evidence-based for targeting methane-dominant Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO)?",
            "options": [
                "Caprylic Acid",
                "Allicin (concentrated from Garlic)",
                "L-Glutamine",
                "Peppermint Oil"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While many antimicrobials work for hydrogen-producers, Allicin has specific research showing efficacy against the methanogens (like Methanobrevibacter smithii) associated with IMO."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Mitochondrial Medicine (Lesson 3) emphasizes the 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR). Which nutrient is essential for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for ATP production via beta-oxidation?",
            "options": [
                "L-Carnitine",
                "Coenzyme Q10",
                "Alpha-Lipoic Acid",
                "Magnesium Malate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L-Carnitine acts as the 'shuttle' that moves fatty acids into the mitochondria; without it, fatty acid metabolism is impaired even if the electron transport chain is functional."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In the context of Endocrine Harmony (Lesson 4), what does a 'flattened' diurnal cortisol curve (low morning and low evening levels) typically indicate?",

                "Excessive intake of exogenous caffeine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flattened curve, characterized by a lack of the morning cortisol awakening response (CAR) and low output throughout the day, signifies advanced HPA axis dysfunction and reduced adaptive capacity."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 covers Biotransformation. Which phase of detoxification involves 'antiporters' like P-glycoprotein to actively pump conjugated toxins out of the cell and into the bile or urine?",

                "Phase IV (Mineralization)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III is the transport phase where specialized proteins pump the water-soluble metabolites created in Phase II out of the cells for final excretion."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Immune Modulation, Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs) are therapeutically used to:",
            "options": [
                "Suppress the entire immune system like a corticosteroid",
                "Actively 'switch off' the inflammatory response and clear cellular debris",
                "Increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6",
                "Stimulate the production of more antibodies against self-tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike anti-inflammatories that block the start of inflammation, SPMs facilitate the 'resolution' phase, helping the body finish the inflammatory cycle and return to homeostasis."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "In Cardiometabolic Targets (Lesson 7), which marker is identified as a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk than standard LDL-C because it measures the total number of atherogenic particles?",

                "HDL-2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB is the primary structural protein found on all potentially atherogenic lipid particles; a high ApoB count indicates a high number of particles, which is a better proxy for risk than the cholesterol volume within them."

                "Increasing the absorption of dietary glucose in the small intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine is often called 'nature's metformin' because it activates AMPK, which improves glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis."

            "question": "During a targeted antimicrobial protocol, a client experiences a 'Herxheimer reaction.' According to Lesson 8, what is the best clinical management strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Double the dose to kill the pathogens faster",
                "Immediately stop the protocol and refer to the ER",
                "Slow the titration, increase 'binders' (like charcoal), and support drainage/elimination",
                "Tell the client the reaction is purely psychological"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing a die-off reaction involves reducing the rate of pathogen kill (slower titration) while increasing the body's ability to capture and excrete the resulting toxins (binders and drainage support)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a constituent of the deiodinase enzymes; a deficiency can lead to 'Low T3 Syndrome' where T4 levels are normal but active T3 is insufficient."
