Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here for this lesson because today we are diving into what I consider the heart of functional medicine. In our last lesson, we mastered the Clinical Decision Matrix. We looked at how to decide when a client is ready to move from foundational habits into targeted interventions. Now, we are going to apply that exact logic to the most common clinical target you will encounter in your practice: the gastrointestinal system.

The gut is truly the gateway to systemic health. You’ve probably heard that a thousand times, but as a practitioner, you need to understand exactly why that is true and, more importantly, how to fix it when it breaks. While the rest of the wellness world is out there offering generic "gut cleanses" or selling "30-day detox" kits, we do things differently. We use a precise, evidence-based protocol known as the 5R Framework. 

In this lesson, I’m going to teach you how to navigate complex dysbiosis. We’re going to talk about how to restore digestive capacity, how to repair the intestinal barrier using therapeutic dosing, and how to use strain-specific probiotics. This is really where your clinical detective work from the Reveal phase transforms into life-changing results for your clients. By the time we’re done today, you’ll be able to master the sequence of the 5R Framework, identify selective antimicrobial herbs that target the "bad guys" without hurting the "good guys," and differentiate between probiotic strains for things like SIBO or histamine intolerance. We’ll also look at designing a mucosal repair protocol and assessing the need for enzymatic support.

So, let’s start with the big picture. Why do we use the 5R Framework? In functional medicine, we don't just "treat" symptoms like bloating or acid reflux. We don't just give a supplement for a symptom. Instead, we use this framework to systematically rebuild the entire environment of the GI tract. Now, I want to be clear: this framework isn't always a perfectly straight line. Often, we might address multiple "Rs" at the same time. But the sequence provides the clinical logic you need for long-term resolution. 

Let’s walk through the five stages. First is Remove. This is where we eliminate pathogens, allergens, and toxins. We might use antimicrobials, an elimination diet, or biofilm disruptors. Second is Replace. We have to restore what’s missing, like digestive secretions, Betaine HCl, or enzymes. Third is Reinnoculate. This is about balancing the microbiome with probiotics and prebiotics. Fourth is Repair. We have to heal the actual mucosal lining using things like L-Glutamine or Zinc Carnosine. And finally, the fifth R is Rebalance. This is where we look at lifestyle, the nervous system, and vagus nerve tone.

Many of your future clients will come to you having already tried over-the-counter probiotics, and they’ll tell you they didn't work. Your value as a premium practitioner—and I’m talking about the kind of expertise that justifies a $300 to $500 fee for an initial assessment—lies in your ability to explain why those previous attempts failed. It’s usually because they skipped the first two Rs and went straight to Reinnoculate. You can’t plant a garden in a patch of weeds without clearing the ground first.

Let’s talk about Phase 1: Remove. When your Reveal phase identifies dysbiosis, SIBO, or Candida, the Target phase begins here. But here is the key: the goal is not "scorched earth." We aren't trying to kill everything in the gut. We are aiming for selective modulation. We want to nudge the microbiome back into balance. 

There was a landmark study in 2014 published in Global Advances in Health and Medicine that really changed the game for us. It found that herbal antimicrobial therapy was at least as effective as Rifaximin, which is the leading pharmaceutical for SIBO. And the best part? The herbal approach had significantly fewer side effects. 

When we talk about these herbs, there are a few heavy hitters you need to know. First is Berberine. You find this in plants like Goldenseal or Oregon Grape. It’s incredible because it targets Gram-negative bacteria but also helps improve insulin sensitivity. Then there’s Oregano Oil. This is high in carvacrol and thymol. It’s a very potent antifungal and antibacterial, but you have to be careful with it because it’s so strong. I usually don't keep clients on high-dose oregano oil for more than four to six weeks. 

Then we have Allicin, which comes from garlic. This is our go-to for methane-dominant overgrowth, what we call IMO. And finally, there’s Neem. This is an Ayurvedic staple that is great at disrupting biofilms. Biofilms are like little protective shields that bacteria build around themselves. Neem helps break those down so our other interventions can actually reach the pathogens.

I want to tell you about a client of mine named Sarah to show you how this looks in the real world. Sarah was 48 and a school teacher. She came to me with severe bloating. She said that by 2:00 PM every day, she looked "six months pregnant." She was also struggling with brain fog and fatigue. When we did the Reveal phase, her breath testing confirmed Hydrogen-dominant SIBO. 

Now, here’s the interesting part: Sarah had been taking a very expensive, high-dose "multi-strain" probiotic she bought at a health food store. But that probiotic was actually making her bloating worse. This is common in SIBO because you’re essentially adding more bacteria to an area that is already overpopulated. 

So, for our Target phase, we started with "Remove." We did a four-week protocol using Berberine and Neem, and we put her on a temporary Low-FODMAP diet to starve the overgrowth. Within just 14 days, she had an 80% reduction in bloating. Her morning brain fog completely cleared up. That is the power of a targeted "Remove" phase.

Now, let’s move to Phase 2: Replace. This is about replacing "digestive fire." You can target the microbiome all day long, but it’s futile if the client can’t actually break down their food. Low stomach acid, or hypochlorhydria, is a primary driver of dysbiosis. Think of stomach acid as your first line of defense. It’s supposed to kill pathogens before they ever reach the rest of your digestive tract.

As we age, especially in that 40 to 55 age bracket, our production of HCl and enzymes naturally starts to drop. And if a client is under a lot of stress—meaning they are in a state of sympathetic dominance—their body literally shuts down these secretions. You can't digest well if you're running from a metaphorical tiger.

To address this, we look at three main things. First is Betaine HCl. This lowers the gastric pH. But a huge safety note here: you must never give Betaine HCl to someone with active peptic ulcers or someone taking NSAIDs or corticosteroids. It can cause serious damage. Second, we look at pancreatic enzymes like lipase, amylase, and protease. These are essential for clients who feel like there’s a "brick in their stomach" after they eat. And third, we have Ox Bile. This is critical for anyone who has had their gallbladder removed or has very sluggish bile flow. You can usually spot this if a client mentions having pale or greasy stools.

One of my favorite practical tools is the Betaine HCl titration test. It’s a simple way to target low acid. You have the client take one capsule with a protein-rich meal. If they feel nothing—no warmth, no burning—they likely have low acid. Then, at the next meal, they take two capsules. They keep increasing by one capsule per meal until they feel a slight warmth in their stomach. At that point, they drop back down to the previous dose. That becomes their therapeutic target.

Next, let’s talk about Phase 3: Reinnoculate. We are officially past the "one-size-fits-all" probiotic era. In the Target phase, we match specific strains to the client’s actual symptoms. If you have a client with SIBO or IMO, you want to avoid those standard lactobacillus blends and instead use spore-based or soil-based organisms like Bacillus coagulans or Bacillus subtilis. These are much better tolerated in overgrowth cases.

If a client is on antibiotics or has antibiotic-associated diarrhea, I always reach for Saccharomyces boulardii. This is actually a beneficial yeast, not a bacteria. Because it’s a yeast, antibiotics don't kill it. This makes it the perfect intervention to use *during* a course of antibiotics to protect the gut. 

For clients with histamine intolerance—those people who react to fermented foods or spinach—you have to be very careful. Some probiotics actually produce histamine. You want to stick to histamine-neutral strains like Bifidobacterium infantis or Lactobacillus plantarum. And for something like Inflammatory Bowel Disease or Ulcerative Colitis, that’s when we use the very high-potency, multi-strain probiotics like Visbiome.

Now we come to Phase 4: Repair. This is about the mucosal barrier. You’ve probably heard the term "Leaky Gut." Clinically, we call this intestinal permeability. When that barrier is compromised, things like lipopolysaccharides, or LPS, can leak into the bloodstream. This triggers the "Defense and Repair" node of the Functional Medicine Matrix and causes systemic inflammation.

To heal this, we need therapeutic dosing. This is where many practitioners fail—they don't give enough of the nutrient to actually move the needle. For L-Glutamine, which is the primary fuel for the cells lining the small intestine, we are looking at 10 to 20 grams a day. That’s usually a couple of scoops of powder, not just a single capsule.

We also use Zinc Carnosine. This is a specific, chelated form of zinc that targets the gut lining. Research shows it can reduce gut permeability by up to 70% in high-stress environments. Another game-changer is Serum-Derived Bovine Immunoglobulins, or SBI. Think of these as a "molecular sponge." They bind to toxins like LPS in the gut before they can even cross the barrier. And finally, there’s DGL, or Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice. This helps increase protective mucus production without the side effects that regular licorice has on blood pressure.

Here is a coach tip I want you to remember: Don't start heavy "Repair" nutrients while a client is still in the middle of a heavy "Remove" phase. If they are taking high-dose antimicrobials to kill an infection, it’s like trying to paint a house while the fire department is still hosing it down. You need to let the inflammation settle slightly first before you focus on the "Heal and Seal" protocol.

Finally, we reach Phase 5: Rebalance. This is often the most overlooked "R," but it’s the one that prevents relapse. Rebalance is about the lifestyle factors that keep the microbiome healthy. 

We have to focus on Vagus Nerve Tone. The Vagus nerve is like the intercom system between the brain and the gut. If that signal is weak, digestion will be weak. I teach my clients simple things like gargling loudly, singing, or deep diaphragmatic breathing before meals. This stimulates the parasympathetic state—the "rest and digest" state—that is required for the body to actually use the nutrients we’re giving it.

We also have to talk about Circadian Rhythm. Did you know your microbiome has its own internal clock? If a client is eating late at night or has irregular sleep patterns, it disrupts the Migrating Motor Complex. This is the "cleansing wave" of the gut that sweeps out bacteria and prevents SIBO from coming back. 

And don't forget meal hygiene. I tell my clients they need to chew their food 20 to 30 times per bite. It sounds simple, but most people gulp their food down. Chewing is the only mechanical part of digestion we can actually control. We also want to avoid drinking too much liquid during meals so we don't dilute those important digestive enzymes we talked about earlier.

I often see women in mid-life who feel like they are "doing everything right"—they’re exercising and eating clean—but they’re still gaining weight. I explain to them that gut dysbiosis can actually cause the body to extract more calories from food than it normally would. By targeting the gut, you aren't just fixing their bloating; you are actually fixing their metabolism from the inside out.

Let’s take a moment to check your understanding of what we’ve covered. I want you to think about these four questions. 

First, which nutrient is the primary fuel for the cells lining the small intestine and requires high therapeutic dosing for repair? If you said L-Glutamine, you’re right. Remember, we’re looking for 10 to 20 grams.

Second, why might a standard probiotic actually make things worse for a client with SIBO? It’s because in SIBO, the problem is an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. Adding more bacteria, even "good" ones, can just add fuel to the fire and increase gas and bloating.

Third, what is the main reason you would *not* give someone Betaine HCl? The big contraindications are active peptic ulcers or the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids, because of the risk of damaging the stomach lining.

And fourth, which of the 5 Rs involves things like stimulating the Vagus nerve and improving meal hygiene? That’s the Rebalance phase. It’s all about the environment and the nervous system.

To wrap things up, let’s summarize the key takeaways from today. 

First, the 5R Framework—Remove, Replace, Reinnoculate, Repair, and Rebalance—is our systematic, golden standard for gut restoration. 

Second, remember that selective antimicrobials like Berberine and Neem can be just as effective as drugs like Rifaximin for SIBO, but they are often much gentler on the system.

Third, you must restore "digestive fire." If you don't address low stomach acid and low enzymes, the dysbiosis will almost certainly come back.

Fourth, probiotic therapy has to be strain-specific. We use S. boulardii for antibiotic support and spore-based strains for SIBO. 

And finally, gut health is both a "bottom-up" and a "top-down" process. We need the right nutrients and supplements, but we also need to rebalance the nervous system and the lifestyle factors that allow the gut to thrive.

You’ve done a lot of heavy lifting in this lesson. Gut health can be complex, but when you follow the 5R logic, you have a roadmap that works. Take some time to review these concepts, and I’ll see you in the next lesson where we’ll continue building your clinical expertise. Great work today. See you soon.
