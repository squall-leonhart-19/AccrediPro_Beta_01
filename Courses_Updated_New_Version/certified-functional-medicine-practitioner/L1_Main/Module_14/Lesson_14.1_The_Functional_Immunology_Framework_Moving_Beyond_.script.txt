Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you are here with me today. In this lesson, we are going to dive deep into one of the most fascinating and, honestly, one of the most misunderstood areas of human health: the immune system. Now, I know that when many practitioners hear the word immunology, they start to feel a little bit of anxiety. It is a field that is traditionally taught with massive textbooks full of complex signaling pathways and incredibly dense Latin terminology. But here at AccrediPro, we do things differently. We are going to look at the immune system through the lens of functional medicine, which means we are moving away from just memorizing cell types and moving toward understanding the story of defense and repair.

In our previous modules, we spent a lot of time exploring bioenergetics and endocrinology. We looked at how the body creates energy and how it sends signals via hormones. Today, we are going to connect those two systems to what we call the Immune Node. This is where the rubber meets the road. We are going to see how cellular energy and hormone signaling actually dictate the intelligence of the immune response. If a cell doesn't have enough ATP, it can't defend itself. If cortisol levels are chronically high or chronically low, the immune system loses its compass.

Welcome to Module 14. In functional medicine, we simplify immunology by asking a very different set of questions. Instead of just asking which drug can suppress this symptom or which steroid can shut down this inflammation, we ask why. Why is the system dysregulated in the first place? Why has the body decided that its own tissue is an enemy? This lesson is your foundational framework. It’s designed to help you move from being a practitioner who just manages symptoms to a practitioner who facilitates root-cause resolution.

By the time we finish our conversation today, I want you to be able to do four specific things. First, I want you to be able to analyze the evolutionary mismatch between our ancestral immune system and the modern, often toxic, environment we live in today. Second, we are going to apply the R.O.O.T.S. Method to identify what we call ATMs—that stands for Antecedents, Triggers, and Mediators. Third, I want you to be able to clearly distinguish between the three faces of dysfunction: immune deficiency, immune hyperactivity, and the loss of self-tolerance. And finally, I’m going to teach you how to execute a comprehensive clinical intake that is specifically focused on uncovering those hidden immune stressors that most people miss.

Let’s start by talking about this idea of evolutionary mismatch. I like to call this the Always-On Guard. You see, the human immune system didn't just appear out of nowhere. It evolved over millions of years to solve two very specific, very high-stakes problems. The first was acute infection. We’re talking about bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The second was physical trauma, like a wound from a hunt or a fall. In our ancestral environment, these threats were intense, but they were intermittent. A tiger might jump out at you, or you might eat some tainted meat, but once the threat was resolved, the immune system would return to a state of quiet surveillance. It knew how to turn on, and just as importantly, it knew how to turn off.

But now, look at the modern world. We are facing a massive mismatch. Our ancient guards are now being bombarded twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. It’s not just tigers and bacteria anymore. It’s processed food antigens. It’s environmental toxins in our water and air. It’s chronic psychological stress from our phones and our jobs. It’s even the artificial blue light that disrupts our circadian rhythms. We have taken a system designed for short bursts of activity and forced it into a state of permanent mobilization.

There was a landmark study published in the journal Nature in 2021 that really puts this into perspective. It suggested that chronic inflammatory diseases now account for over 50 percent of all deaths worldwide. Think about that for a second. More than half of all deaths are linked to a dysregulated immune system. This statistic really underscores the severity of this evolutionary disconnect.

When you’re explaining this to your clients, I want you to use the analogy of a home security guard. In the past, this guard only had to fight off the occasional burglar. He was well-rested and sharp. But today, that same guard is being pelted with pebbles, loud noises, and bright lights every single second of the day. He never gets to sleep. He never gets a break. Eventually, that guard gets exhausted. He gets confused. He might start shooting at the mailman because he’s so jumpy—that’s what we call autoimmunity. Or, he might become so burnt out that he fails to notice a real intruder walking through the front door—that’s immune deficiency. This analogy helps clients understand that their symptoms aren't a sign that their body is broken; they’re a sign that their internal guard is overwhelmed.

Now, how do we actually help these people? We have to move beyond suppression. To do that, we use the R.O.O.T.S. Method to organize the client's history. We are looking for the ATMs—the Antecedents, Triggers, and Mediators—that have shifted the immune system from a state of defense and repair into a state of chronic inflammation.

Let’s break these down, because understanding the difference between them will change the way you practice. First, we have Antecedents. These are the factors that set the initial calibration of the immune system. This starts even before birth. We look at things like whether the client was born via C-section or if they were breastfed. We know that a C-section birth skips the vital seeding of the microbiome that happens in the birth canal, which can fundamentally change how the immune system learns to recognize friends versus foes. We also look at genetics, like the HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 markers, which can predispose someone to things like celiac disease. These aren't destiny, but they are the "soil" the immune system grows in.

Next, we have Triggers. These are the sparks that initiate the dysregulated response. A trigger could be a viral infection, like the Epstein-Barr Virus. It could be a significant exposure to toxic mold in a water-damaged building. Or it could be something as common as gluten ingestion in someone who has lost oral tolerance. This is the moment the client usually points to when they say, "I’ve never been the same since that trip to Mexico" or "Everything changed after I had that bad flu."

But here is where many practitioners get stuck. They focus only on the trigger. They try to kill the virus or kill the mold, and yet the client still doesn't feel better. Why? Because of the Mediators. Mediators are the biochemicals that keep the inflammatory fire burning long after the initial spark is gone. We’re talking about things like cytokines—specifically IL-6 or TNF-alpha—histamine, and even cortisol.

I want you to really hear this: your job as a practitioner is to identify the mediators that are preventing the client from getting well. If a client is in a state of constant, high-level stress, their cortisol is acting as a mediator. It might be preventing their immune system from ever shutting off that inflammatory response. You could give them all the antivirals in the world, but if you don't address the cortisol and the cytokine storm, they will stay stuck in that "always-on" state.

This leads us to the three faces of immune dysfunction. In conventional medicine, we often see these issues siloed. You go to an allergist for allergies, an infectious disease doctor for chronic infections, and a rheumatologist for autoimmunity. But in functional medicine, we recognize that most immune dysfunction falls into one of three overlapping categories.

The first is Immune Deficiency, or under-activity. Now, I’m not just talking about severe cases like HIV. In our coaching practices, we see sub-clinical deficiency all the time. These are the clients who tell you they catch every cold that goes around. They have wounds that take forever to heal. They have chronic, reactivating infections like shingles or frequent cold sores. Very often, this isn't a "broken" system; it’s a "starving" system. It’s driven by nutrient depletion—specifically things like Zinc, Vitamin D, and Vitamin A—or it’s driven by mitochondrial exhaustion. If the "batteries" of the immune cells are dead, the cells can't do their job.

The second face is Immune Hyperactivity, or over-activity. This is the system reacting to things it should absolutely ignore. Think of allergies, asthma, and the increasingly common Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, or MCAS. In these cases, the system is hyper-vigilant. It’s twitchy. It hasn't turned against the self yet, but it’s screaming at the environment. It’s reacting to pollen, to dust, to perfumes, and to foods as if they were deadly pathogens.

The third and most severe face is the Loss of Self-Tolerance, which we know as autoimmunity. This is where the immune system can no longer distinguish between "self" and "non-self." It’s a tragic case of mistaken identity. And this is a growing crisis. A massive meta-analysis from 2023, which looked at 22,000 individuals, found that the incidence of autoimmune diseases is increasing by 3 to 9 percent every single year in industrialized nations. This isn't just better testing; it’s a real increase driven by our environment. One of the main mechanisms here is molecular mimicry. This is when a trigger—like a virus or a food protein—looks so much like a human tissue that the immune system gets confused and starts attacking both.

To bring this to life, let me tell you about a client named Sarah. She was a 48-year-old former nurse, so she was very medically literate. She came to see me with what she called "mystery fatigue." She had profound exhaustion, migratory joint pain—meaning the pain would move from her wrist one day to her knee the next—and a thick brain fog. All of this started after a really severe bout of mononucleosis two years prior. She had been to her primary care doctor, and all her conventional labs—her CBC and her metabolic panels—were "normal." She was told she was just depressed or perhaps it was just "part of aging."

But when we used the R.O.O.T.S. framework, the picture became clear. Her Antecedent was a history of heavy antibiotic use as a child, which we know weakens the gut-immune connection. Her Trigger was a reactivated Epstein-Barr Virus combined with high levels of a mold toxin called Ochratoxin A that we found in her system. But the real key was her Mediators. Her TGF-beta 1 was through the roof, and her Vitamin D was dangerously low. This meant her immune system had no "brakes."

Our intervention wasn't about suppressing her pain. We addressed the mold using our Reveal phase protocols, and we supported her T-regulatory cells—those are the "peacekeeper" cells—using Vitamin D and glutathione. Within four months, Sarah’s joint pain was completely gone. Her energy returned to about 90 percent of her baseline. And the best part? She was so inspired that she left her stressful nursing job and started her own coaching practice helping other nurses. She’s now earning over 120,000 dollars a year working just 25 hours a week. That is the power of finding the root cause.

So, how do you find these triggers in your own clients? It all comes down to the Clinical Intake. This is your most important tool. Most immune triggers are actually hidden in plain sight, but you have to know how to look for the "tipping point." I want to give you four critical questions that should be in every one of your intakes.

First: "Was there a significant stressor or illness just before your symptoms began?" This helps you identify the Trigger. Don't just look for physical illness; look for emotional trauma, a divorce, or a job loss. The nervous system and the immune system are essentially one integrated unit.

Second: "Do your symptoms change based on your environment?" I often ask if they feel better when they are on vacation or away from their home for a few days. If they say, "Actually, my brain fog clears up when I visit my sister in Arizona," you need to be thinking about environmental mediators like mold or indoor air quality in their primary residence.

Third: "How many rounds of antibiotics have you taken in your lifetime?" This helps you assess that microbiome-immune antecedent. If someone has had 20 rounds of antibiotics, their "guard" is likely confused because its primary training ground—the gut—has been disrupted.

And fourth: "Do you have a history of adverse childhood experiences?" We call these ACEs. Research shows a direct, linear connection between childhood trauma and adult autoimmune risk. The nervous system sets the tone for the immune system’s level of vigilance.

Now, here is a professional tip for when you are asking these questions. When a client finishes an answer, I want you to wait five seconds before you respond. Just sit in the silence. In immunology cases, clients often remember a "small" detail only after that moment of silence. They might suddenly remember, "Oh, wait, my basement did flood six months before I got sick," or "I did have that root canal right before the joint pain started." Those "small" details are often the primary triggers you’ve been looking for.

I want to encourage you: you do not need to be a PhD Immunologist to help people change their lives. If you can simply identify that a client’s "guard" is overactive, and you can help them remove the "pebbles"—the toxins and the allergens—and provide them with "nourishment" like the right nutrients, restorative sleep, and nervous system support, you will see better results than many specialists who only offer symptom suppression.

Let’s wrap up with a quick summary of what we’ve covered today. First, remember that functional immunology is about Defense and Repair, not just shutting things down. We are looking for the "why." Second, always keep that evolutionary mismatch in mind. Chronic inflammation is what happens when an ancient defense system meets a modern, high-stress environment. Third, remember that immune dysfunction exists on a spectrum. It moves from deficiency to hyperactivity and finally to a loss of tolerance.

Your success in these cases depends on your ability to identify the ATMs. Look for the Antecedents in their birth and genetic history. Find the Triggers like infections or toxins. And most importantly, manage the Mediators like cytokines and stress hormones that are keeping them stuck. Use your clinical intake to find that tipping point in their timeline.

You are doing incredible work. By understanding these frameworks, you are becoming the practitioner that your clients have been searching for—the one who finally listens to the whole story and connects the dots.

Great work today. I am so proud of the progress you’re making. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
