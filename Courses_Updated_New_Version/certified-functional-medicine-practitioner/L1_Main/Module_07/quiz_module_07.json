        {
            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "In the Electron Transport Chain (ETC), what is the final electron acceptor required to maintain the flow of electrons and produce water as a byproduct?",
            "options": ["Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+)", "Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)", "Molecular Oxygen (O2)", "Cytochrome C"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Molecular oxygen (O2) acts as the final electron acceptor at Complex IV (Cytochrome c oxidase). Without oxygen, the ETC backs up, ATP production halts, and the cell shifts to anaerobic glycolysis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a critical antioxidant enzyme that converts the superoxide radical into which substance?",
            "options": ["Hydroxyl radical", "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)", "Water (H2O)", "Glutathione disulfide (GSSG)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SOD neutralizes superoxide by converting it into hydrogen peroxide, which is subsequently neutralized into water by catalase or glutathione peroxidase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "On a Functional Organic Acids Test (OAT), a significant elevation in Succinate, but not Fumarate, most likely indicates a functional deficiency in which nutrient?",
            "options": ["Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)", "Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)", "Vitamin B3 (Niacin)", "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Succinate is converted to Fumarate by Succinate Dehydrogenase (Complex II), which is a riboflavin (B2)-dependent enzyme. Elevated succinate often reflects a B2 deficiency or inhibition of Complex II."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "According to the Functional Medicine Matrix, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are primarily mapped to which node?",
            "options": ["Communication", "Defense and Repair", "Energy", "Transport"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Energy' node of the Functional Medicine Matrix specifically tracks mitochondrial function, ATP production, and the balance of oxidative stress/redox potential."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Photobiomodulation (Red and Near-Infrared light) exerts its primary bioenergetic effect by stimulating which specific mitochondrial component?",
            "options": ["Complex I (NADH Dehydrogenase)", "Complex IV (Cytochrome C Oxidase)", "The Mitochondrial Outer Membrane", "ATP Synthase (Complex V)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) contains chromophores that absorb light in the 600-900nm range, which displaces inhibitory nitric oxide and increases mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical is specifically recognized for its ability to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new mitochondria) via the activation of PGC-1α?",
            "options": ["Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ)", "Alpha-Lipoic Acid", "N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)", "Magnesium Malate"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PQQ has been shown in research to stimulate PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, effectively increasing mitochondrial density within cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Which environmental toxin is particularly known for mimicking phosphate and inhibiting the production of ATP by interfering with phosphorylation in the mitochondria?",
            "options": ["Lead", "Mercury", "Arsenic", "Glyphosate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arsenate (a form of arsenic) is a molecular mimic of inorganic phosphate. It can replace phosphate in biochemical reactions, leading to 'arsenolysis' where ATP production is bypassed, causing a massive energy deficit."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Metabolic flexibility is defined as the body's ability to efficiently switch between which two primary fuel sources?",
            "options": ["Glucose and Amino Acids", "Glucose and Fatty Acids", "Fatty Acids and Ketones", "Ketones and Lactate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility refers to the capacity to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability, specifically transitioning between glucose (fed state) and fatty acids (fasted/exercise state)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a 65-year-old client with chronic fatigue and high markers of lipid peroxidation. Which form of CoQ10 is the most appropriate recommendation for this specific case?",
            "options": ["Ubiquinone", "Ubiquinol", "Idebenone", "CoQ10 with Piperine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ubiquinol is the reduced, antioxidant form of CoQ10. It is preferred for older adults and those with high oxidative stress because the body's ability to reduce ubiquinone into ubiquinol declines with age and high toxic load."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client's lab results show a high Lactate-to-Pyruvate ratio (e.g., >25:1). What does this finding clinically suggest to a Functional Medicine practitioner?",
            "options": ["A deficiency in Biotin", "Excessive aerobic capacity", "An obstruction or 'bottleneck' in the Electron Transport Chain", "High levels of fatty acid oxidation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high Lactate-to-Pyruvate ratio indicates that pyruvate is being shunted toward lactate because it cannot be efficiently processed through the ETC (likely due to Complex inhibition or lack of oxygen), signaling a state of mitochondrial 'backup' or dysfunction."
