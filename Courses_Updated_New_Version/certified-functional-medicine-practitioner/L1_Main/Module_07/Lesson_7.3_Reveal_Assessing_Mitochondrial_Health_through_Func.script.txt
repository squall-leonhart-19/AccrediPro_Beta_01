Hi, it is Sarah. I am so glad you are here with me today. In our last lesson, we took a deep dive into the cost of energy production, which we know is oxidative stress. Now, we are moving into a really exciting phase of the ROOTS Method. This is the reveal phase. This is where we stop guessing and start using objective, advanced functional biomarkers to quantify exactly what is happening inside your clients mitochondria.

One of the most common complaints you are going to encounter in your practice, especially if you work with women in their 40s and 50s, is that vague, heavy, soul-crushing feeling of unexplained fatigue. You know the client I am talking about. She has been to three different doctors. They have run her thyroid panels, they have checked her iron, and they have looked at her basic blood chemistry. Every single time, she is told that her labs are normal. She is told she is just stressed, or maybe she just needs more sleep, or perhaps it is just a natural part of aging.

But she knows, and you know, that something is fundamentally wrong. Functional testing allows us to stop looking at the surface and start peering directly inside the cell. Today, we are going to bridge that gap between those subjective, frustrating symptoms and the objective metabolic data that gives us the answers.

By the time we finish this lesson, I want you to feel incredibly confident in a few key areas. First, we are going to learn how to interpret Citric Acid Cycle markers on an Organic Acid Test, which we call the OAT. This helps us identify exactly where the enzymatic roadblocks are occurring. We are also going to look at fatty acid oxidation defects using markers like Adipate, Suberate, and Ethylmalonate. We will analyze Pyruvate and Lactate levels to see if your client is shifting from efficient aerobic metabolism into that survival-mode anaerobic metabolism. Finally, we will talk about how to measure actual systemic oxidative damage using Lipid Peroxides and 8-OHdG, so you can show your client the physical evidence of the cellular rust we have been talking about.

Ultimately, the goal is for you to be able to correlate clinical symptoms, like that dreaded post-exertional malaise, with real data. When you can do that, you are no longer just a coach giving advice; you are a practitioner providing a metabolic roadmap.

Let's start by looking at the clinical face of mitochondrial fatigue. It is important to remember that mitochondrial dysfunction rarely shows up as a single, neat disease. Instead, it looks like a systemic decline in resilience. In your practice, you have to be able to differentiate between simple tiredness, which might just be a late night or a busy week, and true bioenergetic failure.

I want to tell you about a client of mine named Sarah. She was 48 years old and a high-level marketing director. On paper, she was successful and driven, but physically, she was falling apart. She came to me with chronic fatigue, intense brain fog, and what we call exercise intolerance. Sarah told me that if she took a simple 20-minute walk around her neighborhood, she would be completely crashed for the next two days. She described it as feeling like her batteries simply would not hold a charge. This is a classic sign of post-exertional malaise, or PEM. Her conventional doctor had checked her TSH and her iron, and because they were in the normal range, she was dismissed.

When we ran her Organic Acid Test, we were able to reveal the state of her Citric Acid Cycle. We found significant elevations in Citrate and Isocitrate. This told us immediately that there was a block in an enzyme called aconitase. Now, aconitase is incredibly sensitive to oxidative stress. By finding this, we could explain to Sarah that her crash wasn't in her head and it wasn't just stress. It was a failure of cellular respiration. Her cells literally could not process the fuel they were being given.

Statistics show us that mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary driver in over 40 percent of chronic fatigue cases. It is also a hallmark of what we call inflammaging. When you are assessing your clients, I want you to look for what I call the Mitochondrial Triad. The first is that exercise intolerance I mentioned. This is an inability to recover from physical exertion that used to be easy. The second is brain fog. The brain consumes about 20 percent of the entire body's ATP. It is the most energy-hungry organ we have, so it is usually the first to suffer when the mitochondria fail. The third is temperature dysregulation. If your client is always wearing a sweater when everyone else is in short sleeves, or if they have cold hands and feet, pay attention. Mitochondria generate heat as a byproduct of making energy. If they aren't making energy, they aren't making heat.

When you can explain a client's symptoms as a failure of cellular respiration rather than just stress, your value as a practitioner goes through the roof. This kind of specialized interpretation is why practitioners can charge premium rates, often hundreds of dollars for a single lab review, because you are giving the client answers that no one else has been able to provide.

Now, let's talk about the Organic Acid Test itself. I like to think of the OAT as your metabolic window. It measures the metabolic byproducts that spill into the urine. Think of the Citric Acid Cycle like a series of pipes. If an enzyme at one point in the pipe isn't working, the fluid behind it is going to back up and overflow. In the body, that overflow is what we measure in the urine.

Let's look at some of the specific markers you will see. If you see high levels of Citrate or Isocitrate, that usually points to that block in the aconitase enzyme I mentioned earlier. This is often caused by high levels of oxidative stress or sometimes a deficiency in Manganese.

Then we have Alpha-Ketoglutarate. If this marker is high, it is a loud signal that the body needs more support to move that metabolite forward. This step in the cycle is heavily dependent on B-vitamins and Alpha Lipoic Acid. Specifically, it needs B1, B2, B3, and B5. Without those, the cycle just grinds to a halt right there.

Next is Succinate. High levels of Succinate usually indicate a block at Complex Two of the Electron Transport Chain. To fix this, the body typically needs more Riboflavin, which is vitamin B2, and CoQ10.

Finally, we look at Fumarate and Malate. If these levels are very low, it often suggests that the overall mitochondrial fuel or turnover is just low. The client might need overall amino acid support or a higher dose of CoQ10 to get the engine turning again.

Here is a quick coach tip for you: When you see multiple blocks in the Citric Acid Cycle, don't just throw every supplement at the client. Look for the common denominators. Very often, a high-quality B-complex and a bioavailable CoQ10 will clear multiple blocks at once because those nutrients act as the universal keys for these mitochondrial gates.

Now, let's move on to how the body burns fat. Mitochondria are supposed to be metabolically flexible. They should be able to burn glucose when it is available and switch over to burning fat when it isn't. However, many of our clients have lost the ability to import fats into the mitochondria for what we call beta-oxidation. We can see this clearly on the OAT through three specific markers: Adipate, Suberate, and Ethylmalonate.

When Adipate and Suberate are high, it tells us the body is using back-door pathways, specifically something called omega-oxidation. It is doing this because it cannot efficiently burn fats inside the mitochondria. This almost always points to a Riboflavin deficiency.

Ethylmalonate is a bit more specific. High levels suggest a block in fatty acid metabolism that is often linked to an L-Carnitine deficiency. Think of L-Carnitine as the shuttle bus that carries fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane. If the shuttle bus isn't running, the fat stays outside the engine and can't be burned for fuel.

Here is a clinical pearl you should remember: If you have a client who tells you they felt absolutely terrible on a ketogenic or high-fat diet, you must check these markers. They likely have the engine to burn fat, but they lack the fuel pump or the shuttle bus to get the fat into the engine.

This is also a huge factor in weight loss resistance. Many women over 40 struggle to lose weight even when they are eating perfectly and exercising. If they cannot oxidize fatty acids, as shown by high Adipate, they simply cannot burn body fat for fuel, regardless of their calorie deficit. When you show a client this on a lab, it provides a massive Aha! moment. It shifts the conversation away from willpower and back to biochemistry, which builds deep trust between you and the client.

Next, we need to talk about carbohydrate shifts. When mitochondria are overwhelmed, damaged, or lacking nutrients, the cell makes a survival 
choice. It shifts away from efficient aerobic metabolism and toward inefficient anaerobic glycolysis. In the world of chronic disease, we sometimes call this the Warburg Effect.

We look at two main markers here: Pyruvate and Lactate. Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis. Under normal circumstances, it should enter the mitochondria to be converted into a massive amount of ATP. But if it can't get in, usually due to a lack of B1, B3, or Alpha Lipoic Acid, Pyruvate levels will start to rise.

If that Pyruvate has nowhere to go, the body converts it into Lactate. Now, we all know the feeling of a "lactic acid burn" after a heavy workout, but seeing high Lactate in a client who is at rest is a major red flag. It means their mitochondria are essentially suffocating. They are struggling to produce energy even without any physical demand.

One of the most important things you can look at is the Pyruvate to Lactate ratio. A high ratio of Lactate to Pyruvate indicates a redox shift. This means the cell is in a state of relative hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, or perhaps a severe CoQ10 deficiency. This is the biological signature of that post-exertional malaise we talked about earlier. It explains why a simple walk can feel like running a marathon for these clients.

Now, we cannot talk about mitochondrial health without measuring the exhaust they produce. If the mitochondria are leaking electrons, they are going to cause damage to the surrounding cellular structures. We measure this in two main ways.

The first is Lipid Peroxides in the urine. I like to tell clients that this measures the rancidity of their cell membranes. Mitochondrial membranes are packed with polyunsaturated fats, which are very vulnerable to oxidation. If Lipid Peroxides are high, it is a direct indicator that the mitochondrial membranes are being damaged by their own exhaust.

The second marker is 8-OHdG. This is the gold standard for measuring DNA damage. Specifically, it looks at oxidative damage to the guanine base in your DNA. If these levels are high, it means the oxidative stress has moved beyond the membranes and is now attacking the genetic blueprint of the cell. This is a major driver of aging and long-term health risks.

When you are explaining this to a client, you can say something like, "This marker is like a rust test for your DNA. If it is high, it means your cellular library is being damaged. Our goal is to put the anti-rust, which is our antioxidants and mitochondrial support, back into the system to stop the damage." It is a very powerful way to help them understand the urgency of the protocol you are designing.

As we start to wrap up, I want to emphasize that your role as a coach is to take this complex data and turn it into a story the client can understand. When you see high Adipate, don't just say "your fatty acid oxidation is low." Say, "Your body is having trouble getting fat into the cellular engine to burn it for fuel. This is why you feel tired and why the weight isn't moving. We need to give you some specific nutrients to get that fuel moving again."

Let's quickly review some of the big takeaways from today. First, remember that mitochondrial dysfunction reveals itself through those blocks in the Citric Acid Cycle, like high Citrate or Alpha-Ketoglutarate. Second, those fatty acid oxidation markers like Adipate and Suberate are your key to understanding why a client might be struggling with weight or failing on a keto diet. Third, keep a close eye on Pyruvate and Lactate. That shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism is a clear sign of mitochondrial distress. And finally, always look at the collateral damage using Lipid Peroxides and 8-OHdG.

Objective testing is what transforms fatigue from a vague, frustrating symptom into a targeted clinical roadmap. It gives you the confidence to know exactly which nutrients to recommend and it gives your client the peace of mind that there is a real, physical reason for how they feel.

I want to leave you with a few questions to think about as you review your own client cases. If a client has high Adipate and Suberate, what nutrient should be at the top of your list for support? If you see a high Lactate-to-Pyruvate ratio in a resting client, what does that tell you about their ability to handle exercise? And why might a client with these markers feel cold all the time?

Thinking through these questions will help you internalize this data so that when you are sitting across from a client, it becomes second nature.

You are doing incredible work. By learning how to read these cellular signals, you are positioning yourself as a true expert in the field of functional longevity. I am so proud of the progress you are making. Great work today, and I will see you in the next lesson.
