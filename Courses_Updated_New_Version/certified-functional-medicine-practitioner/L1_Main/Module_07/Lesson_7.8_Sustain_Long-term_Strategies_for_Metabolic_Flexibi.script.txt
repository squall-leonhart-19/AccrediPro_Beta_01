Hi, it's Sarah. I am so glad you’re here with me today. In our previous lessons, we spent a lot of time diving deep into the heavy-hitting science. We looked at the intricate biochemistry of ATP. We explored the fascinating and complex world of the Cell Danger Response, or the CDR. But today, we’re doing something different. We are going to take all that brilliant, complex science and translate it into a compassionate coaching conversation. This is the moment where we move a client from feeling completely exhausted to feeling truly empowered.

In my own practice over the years, I have found a recurring truth. The most brilliant science in the world simply doesn’t matter if your client doesn’t understand why they feel the way they do. You can have the most sophisticated protocols and the most advanced lab testing, but if you can’t bridge the gap between the data and the person sitting in front of you, the healing process stalls. Today, we are practicing what I call the Energy Conversation. This is the specific framework where you help a client see that their fatigue isn't a character flaw. It isn't a sign of laziness. And it definitely isn't just an inevitable part of getting older. Instead, you’re going to help them see it for what it really is: a cellular communication issue.

By the end of our time together today, I want you to feel confident in a few key areas. First, you’ll be able to translate mitochondrial dysfunction into a simple, relatable analogy that any client can grasp. Second, you’ll know exactly how to address the I’m just getting old objection with scientific authority and genuine empathy. Third, you’ll be able to explain the direct link between chronic stress and what we call cellular battery drain. And finally, you’ll have a practiced script that builds real hope while validating the very real physical struggle your client is facing.

Think of this as our Energy Conversation Lab. We aren't just learning facts; we are building muscle memory. As a world-class practitioner, your voice and your words are some of the most powerful tools in your kit. So, I want you to imagine a specific person as we walk through this. Let’s meet Elena.

Elena is fifty-two years old. She is a high-school principal in Florida, which means her days are incredibly demanding and often quite loud. She’s recently gone through menopause, and she’s coming to you because she is just done. She describes her fatigue as bone-deep. She tells you about this brain fog that makes her feel stupid at work, which is devastating for someone in her position of leadership. She’s noticing muscle aches even after doing very little activity. When you look at her health history, you see ten years of chronic stress. She had a bad bout of Epstein-Barr virus in her twenties. To keep up with her job, she’s drinking four or five cups of coffee every single day. She wakes up feeling like she hasn't slept at all. She crashes hard at three in the afternoon. And then, the cruelest part: she feels tired but wired when it’s finally time for bed.

When you ask Elena how she feels about all of this, she just sighs. She says, maybe this is just what fifty feels like. My mom was always tired too. Maybe I just need to accept it.

Now, I want you to pause and really hear that. When Elena says those words, she is at a critical junction. She is looking at you, and she is waiting. She’s waiting to see if you will agree with her and confirm her fears, or if you will give her a reason to hope. If you just nod and say, yeah, fifty can be tough, you’ve lost the chance to truly help her. But if you jump straight into a lecture about the electron transport chain without any empathy, she won’t believe you. She’ll think you don’t understand her reality.

So, how do we handle this? We start by validating her experience. We might say, Elena, I hear how heavy this feels for you. And I want you to know that while your experience is common, it’s not actually normal. It’s not just age. It’s a sign that your cells are trying to tell us something.

This is where we bring in the Cellular Battery analogy. I want you to imagine Elena sitting across from you. She’s discouraged. She’s tired. You might say to her, Elena, I want you to think of your cells like they have little internal batteries. In the functional medicine world, we call these mitochondria. Their primary job is to take the food you eat and the oxygen you breathe and turn it into energy, or ATP. When everything is working well, those batteries stay charged, and you feel vibrant. You have the energy to lead your school and the clarity to think on your feet.

But, here’s the thing. Those little batteries have a dual role. They aren't just power plants; they are also sensors. They are constantly scanning your internal environment to see if it’s safe. When you’ve had years of high stress, or old viral issues like that Epstein-Barr you mentioned, or even the hormonal shifts of menopause, your batteries start to get worried. They receive a signal that the environment isn't safe. And when a cell doesn't feel safe, it makes a very logical, very protective choice. It shifts from energy production mode into defense mode.

Imagine your cell is like a house during a big Florida storm. If there’s a hurricane warning, you don’t leave all the lights on, the music blasting, and the front door open. No, you shut off the main power, you board up the windows, and you hunker down in the safest room to wait out the storm. That is exactly what your cells are doing right now. They’ve pulled the plug on your energy production to save resources for protection. Your fatigue isn't a failure of your will; it’s your body’s way of trying to keep you safe. My job is to help your cells feel safe again so they can flip the switch back to production mode.

Can you see how that changes the conversation? Suddenly, Elena isn't a victim of her age or her genes. She’s a person with a physiological system that is doing its best to protect her. That creates immediate buy-in. It creates a partnership.

Now, as you start having these conversations, there are four common pitfalls I see new coaches fall into. I want to walk through these so you can avoid them.

The first is what I call the Krebs Cycle Trap. It is so tempting, especially when you’ve just learned all this amazing science, to want to prove your knowledge. You might want to start drawing out the citric acid cycle or explaining the complexities of the electron transport chain. Please, resist that urge. If your client gets confused, they will feel overwhelmed. And remember, overwhelm is a form of stress. Stress signals the Cell Danger Response. You are literally draining their energy by over-explaining the science. Keep it simple. Use the analogies. If they want the deep science later, you can provide it, but in these initial sessions, clarity is much more important than complexity.

The second pitfall is over-supplementing too early. It’s the classic mistake of jumping straight to CoQ10, PQQ, or magnesium because we know they support the mitochondria. But remember the storm analogy. If the windows are still boarded up and the cell is in defense mode, throwing more fuel at the battery won't work. If the cell feels unsafe due to high stress or unresolved inflammation, it will stay in defense mode regardless of how many supplements you give. We have to address the Cell Danger Response first. We have to signal safety to the nervous system before the mitochondria will accept the help.

The third pitfall is dismissing the age factor. Sometimes coaches try to be so positive that they say, oh, age doesn't matter at all! But Elena knows her body has changed. She knows she doesn't feel like she did at twenty-five. If you tell her age doesn't matter, you lose credibility. Instead, acknowledge it scientifically. You might say, Elena, it’s true that as we get older, our mitochondria naturally become a bit less efficient. Research shows that mitochondrial function can decline by about five to ten percent per decade. However, the rate of that decline is very much within our control. We can’t stop the clock, but we can absolutely optimize how your cells are performing right now. This builds trust because you’re being honest about the biology while still offering a path forward.

The fourth pitfall is ignoring the tired but wired sign. This is a huge clinical clue. If a client is tired but wired, it tells us that their mitochondria are struggling, but their HPA-axis—the stress response system—is over-firing. They are exhausted, but their body is flooded with cortisol and adrenaline because it’s stuck in a state of high alert. If you only focus on the bioenergetics and ignore the nervous system, you won’t get lasting results. You have to address both. You have to help the body feel safe while also supporting the energy production.

In your first few sessions, you might feel like you need to use big words to sound professional. I want to encourage you to resist that. The most successful practitioners I know, the ones who are truly making a difference and, frankly, the ones who are earning top-tier fees, are the ones who can explain complex science to a fifth grader. Clarity creates compliance. When a client truly understands the why behind your recommendations, they are much more likely to follow through.

Let’s practice another part of this conversation. This is something that comes up almost every time: the caffeine objection. Elena tells you, I know I drink a lot of coffee, but I literally cannot function without it. I have to lead a school. If I don't have my caffeine, I can’t do my job.

How do you respond to that without sounding like the fun-police? I like to use the whip the tired horse analogy. You might say, Elena, I completely understand. When you’re feeling this level of exhaustion, caffeine feels like a lifeline. But I want you to imagine a horse that is completely exhausted. It’s been running for miles, it’s dehydrated, and it just wants to collapse and rest. If you take a whip and strike that horse, it will find the energy to run a few more miles. But did you actually give the horse more energy? No, you just forced it to use up its very last reserves. Eventually, that horse is going to collapse, and no amount of whipping will get it back up. Caffeine is the whip. It’s not giving your cells more energy; it’s just demanding that your tired cells work even harder. Our goal is to stop whipping the horse and actually give it the food, water, and rest it needs to run on its own again.

When you use an image like that, the client moves from feeling defensive about their coffee to having a visual understanding of what they are doing to their biology. It changes the motivation from I’m being told I can’t have coffee to I want to stop exhausting my system.

Now, let’s talk about the science behind why this matters so much. When we look at the work of researchers like Dr. Robert Naviaux, who pioneered the concept of the Cell Danger Response, we see that the body has a very specific metabolic signature when it’s in defense mode. A 2014 study in the journal Mitochondrion pointed out that when the CDR is triggered, the cell membrane actually thickens. This is a physical defense mechanism to stop viruses from entering, but it also makes it harder for nutrients to get in and for waste to get out.

This is why Elena feels like she has brain fog. Her cells are literally hunkered down. A 2018 study by Picard and McEwen in Psychosomatic Medicine further explored this, showing that psychological stress can directly impact mitochondrial structure and function. Our thoughts and our environment are literally talking to our mitochondria. When Elena is stressed at the high school, her mitochondria are listening. They are taking that stress signal and translating it into decreased ATP production.

So, when you are coaching Elena, you aren't just talking about diet and supplements. You are talking about signaling. You are helping her change the signals her body is receiving. This is the essence of functional medicine coaching.

I want to give you a few more phrases to practice out loud. It might feel silly to talk to an empty room, but getting these words into your mouth is how you become a master.

Try saying this: Elena, your fatigue isn't a lack of willpower. It’s a physiological state where your cells have prioritized protection over production. We need to signal to your body that it’s safe to start producing energy again.

Notice how that removes the guilt. It takes the burden off her character and puts it on her physiology, which is something we can actually work with.

Or try this one for the age objection: I hear you, Elena. It can feel like aging is just a downward slide. But while our mitochondria do change as we age, we have so much influence over how they behave. Think of it like a car. An older car might need more maintenance, but if you take care of the engine and use the right fuel, it can still run beautifully. We’re going to give your cellular engines the tune-up they’ve been waiting for.

As we wrap up this lab session, let’s review some of the core principles we’ve covered.

First, always validate first. Before you jump into the science of the mitochondria, acknowledge the person’s suffering. Let them know you hear them and that their struggle is real. This builds the rapport that allows the science to be heard.

Second, use powerful analogies. The cellular battery and the tired horse are two of the most effective tools for getting client buy-in. They take abstract concepts and make them concrete.

Third, remember: safety over power. A cell will not produce energy if it doesn’t feel safe. This is the fundamental lesson of the Cell Danger Response. Your coaching must address the factors that are making the client’s system feel threatened—whether that’s chronic stress, poor sleep, hidden inflammation, or even the way they talk to themselves.

Fourth, focus on empowerment. Your goal is to move the client from being a victim of aging or a victim of their circumstances to being an optimizer of their own bioenergetics. You are giving them the steering wheel back.

And finally, remember that mastery of this conversation is what separates a wellness enthusiast from a truly professional Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner. Anyone can read a blog post about mitochondria. But it takes a professional to look a struggling person in the eye and explain the science in a way that provides a clear, hopeful, and actionable path forward.

You’re doing the work to master that today. You’re learning to speak the language of the cells and the language of the heart at the same time. That is where the real healing happens.

I want you to think about Elena one more time. Imagine her six months from now. She’s leading her school with clarity. She’s waking up feeling refreshed. She’s not reaching for that fifth cup of coffee because her cellular batteries are actually holding a charge. She doesn't feel like fifty is a death sentence for her energy; she feels like she’s just getting started. That is the power of the conversation we practiced today.

I am so proud of the work you are putting in. It’s not just about the information; it’s about the transformation you’re going to facilitate for your future clients. Take these analogies, practice them until they feel like your own, and get ready to change some lives.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
