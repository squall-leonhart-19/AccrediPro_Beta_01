            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and prolonged cortisol elevation (or eventual depletion) lead to the suppression of sIgA, indicating weakened mucosal barrier defense and immune exhaustion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fasano's Triad posits that autoimmunity requires a genetic susceptibility, exposure to an environmental antigen (trigger), and the loss of intestinal barrier integrity (leaky gut)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
