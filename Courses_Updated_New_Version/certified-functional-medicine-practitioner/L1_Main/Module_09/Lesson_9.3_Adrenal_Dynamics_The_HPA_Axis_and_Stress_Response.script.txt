Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you are joining me for this lesson. We are about to dive into one of the most misunderstood and yet most critical areas of functional medicine. In our last lesson, we spent a lot of time talking about thyroid optimization. We looked at how the thyroid acts as the metabolic spark plug for the body. But today, we are going to look at what I call the other half of the metabolic engine. We are talking about the HPA axis.

I want to start by being very clear about something. In the world of functional health, you simply cannot fix a thyroid issue while ignoring the adrenal system. They are inextricably linked. They are part of the same feedback loop. If the thyroid is the spark plug, the HPA axis is the battery and the wiring. If the wiring is frayed, it doesn't matter how many new spark plugs you put in; the car just isn't going to run right.

In this lesson, I want to move you beyond the simplistic and, frankly, the scientifically inaccurate terms that many people use in the wellness industry. We are going to move past the idea of adrenal fatigue and embrace a much more modern, much more accurate understanding called HPA Axis Dysregulation, or HPA-D. This distinction is so important. As a practitioner, your ability to interpret things like the Cortisol Awakening Response and hormonal metabolites is what is going to distinguish you as a true expert. It is what allows you to help those clients who come to you saying their doctor told them their labs were normal, even though they feel like they are dragging themselves through every single day.

By the time we finish our conversation today, I want you to be able to do a few specific things. First, we are going to deconstruct the three-tier signaling of the HPA axis. I want you to understand the clinical significance of the CAR, which is that morning cortisol spike. We are going to compare and contrast salivary and urinary cortisol testing using what we call the Reveal Method. We will also talk about how to differentiate between a primary gland failure and a brain-signaling issue. This is a huge paradigm shift for most people. We are also going to look at the metabolic reality of substrate shunting. You might have heard of the pregnenolone steal, but we are going to talk about why that is actually a myth and what is really happening with your hormones. Finally, we will look at how chronic cortisol elevation impacts things like your gut lining and your immune system.

Let’s start with the basics of how this system actually works. Think of the HPA axis as the body’s stress thermostat. It isn't just a collection of isolated organs sitting in different parts of your body. It is a sophisticated, high-speed communication network. It starts in the brain with the hypothalamus. Think of the hypothalamus as the CEO of the system. It is constantly scanning the environment, both inside and outside the body, looking for threats. These threats could be a looming deadline at work, a hidden gut infection, or even just a lack of sleep.

When the hypothalamus perceives a threat, it releases something called Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone, or CRH. This hormone travels a very short distance to the anterior pituitary gland, which acts like the middle manager. The pituitary then releases Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, or ACTH, into the bloodstream. This is the signal that finally reaches the adrenal glands, which sit right on top of your kidneys. The adrenals respond by secreting cortisol.

Now, here is the part that many people miss. There is a critical component of this system called the Cortisol Awakening Response, or the CAR. This is essentially a stress test that your body performs on itself every single morning. Within about thirty minutes of waking up, your cortisol levels should ideally rise by fifty to one hundred and fifty percent. This is a massive surge. It is what gives you the energy to get out of bed, the mental clarity to plan your day, and the resilience to handle whatever comes your way.

I like to tell my clients that the CAR is set by the previous night’s sleep but it is triggered by light. This is why I am so obsessed with morning sunlight. Getting ten minutes of direct sunlight into your eyes—without sunglasses—within thirty minutes of waking up is one of the most powerful things you can do to reset a dysfunctional HPA axis. It is free, it is simple, and it works because it speaks the language of the brain.

When we see a flat CAR on a lab test, it tells us a lot. It is strongly correlated with chronic fatigue, autoimmune progression, and even major depressive disorder. It means the brain has lost its ability to mount a healthy response to the day.

Let me tell you about a client of mine named Linda to show you how this looks in the real world. Linda was forty-eight years old and a former elementary school teacher. She was transitioning into health coaching, so she knew a bit about wellness, but she was struggling. She had this profound fatigue that would peak every day around 3 PM. She described her nights as being wired but tired. She would be exhausted all day, but as soon as her head hit the pillow, her mind would start racing. She had also put on about fifteen pounds of new weight, specifically around her abdomen, which was very frustrating for her because she was eating well and exercising.

Linda had gone to her primary care doctor, and they ran the standard tests. They checked her fasting glucose, her TSH, and a morning serum cortisol level. Everything came back in the normal range. Her doctor basically told her she was just stressed and perhaps getting older. But Linda knew something was wrong.

When we ran advanced salivary testing using the Reveal Method, we saw exactly what was happening. Linda had a blunted Cortisol Awakening Response and an inverted diurnal rhythm. Even though her morning cortisol was technically in the normal range, she failed to mount that necessary fifty percent increase after waking up. That explained her morning brain fog perfectly. Her body wasn't getting the memo that the day had started. Then, her cortisol would spike late in the evening when it should have been dropping, which explained why she couldn't sleep.

Instead of just giving her generic adrenal supplements, we focused on her circadian biology. We had her get that morning sunlight I mentioned. We used two thousand milligrams of Vitamin C to support the adrenal cortex, and we used Phosphatidylserine in the evening. Phosphatidylserine is wonderful because it helps dampen that nocturnal cortisol spike, allowing the body to finally rest. After twelve weeks, Linda’s energy had increased by seventy percent. She lost eight pounds without changing her calories at all. This is such a great example of how hormonal signaling is often more important than simple thermodynamics when it comes to weight and energy.

Now, let’s talk about the testing itself. To truly reveal the root cause, we have to look beyond serum cortisol. A serum test is just a snapshot. It is like looking at a single frame of a movie and trying to guess the whole plot. It also doesn't distinguish between bound and free cortisol. Most of the cortisol in your blood is bound to proteins, meaning it isn't actually active.

In our practice, we use two primary methods. The first is salivary testing. This is the gold standard for measuring the CAR because you can take samples right in your own home at very specific times after waking. It shows us the free, bioavailable cortisol that is actually ready for your cells to use.

The second method is urinary metabolite testing, often called the DUTCH test. This gives us the total cortisol production. It measures the metabolites, which tells us how much cortisol the adrenals actually made over twenty-four hours, versus how much is just circulating in the blood. I like to use the analogy of a bank account. Free cortisol is the cash you have in your pocket right now to spend. Metabolized cortisol is your total income for the year. You need to know both to understand your true financial health.

This brings us to a very important point about terminology. For years, the wellness industry used the term adrenal fatigue. The idea was that the adrenal glands were just tired or worn out from too much stress. But here is the truth: that is physiologically incorrect. Unless a client has something like Addison’s Disease, which is a primary adrenal failure, the glands themselves are usually perfectly fine. They are capable of producing plenty of cortisol.

The actual problem is HPA Axis Dysregulation. This is a top-down problem. It is an adaptive response where the brain purposefully turns down the volume on the signal to the adrenals. Why would it do that? It does it to protect you. Chronic high cortisol is catabolic, meaning it breaks things down. It breaks down muscle, it breaks down the gut lining, and it interferes with brain function. If the stress doesn't stop, the brain eventually says, I have to slow this down before we do permanent damage. So, it downregulates the signal. It is a survival mechanism, not a failure of the gland.

When you use the term HPA Axis Dysregulation instead of adrenal fatigue, you immediately boost your professional legitimacy. It shows that you understand the neurological nature of the stress response. You aren't just repeating marketing slogans; you are speaking the language of physiology.

I also want to clear up another common myth: the pregnenolone steal. You might have heard that because cortisol and sex hormones like progesterone and testosterone all come from the same precursor, pregnenolone, the body steals all the pregnenolone to make cortisol when you are stressed. This makes it sound like there is a physical shortage of raw materials.

The reality is a bit different. It is not about a shortage of materials; it is about enzymatic priority. When you are under chronic stress, high levels of ACTH upregulate the enzymes that produce cortisol. At the same time, inflammatory cytokines downregulate the enzymes that produce sex hormones. The body is making a choice about where to send the traffic. It is a signaling issue. This is why simply giving a client pregnenolone supplements often fails. You are adding more water to the system, but the pipes are still diverted toward cortisol. You have to address the signaling, not just the substrate.

This signaling doesn't just affect your energy and your mood; it has a massive systemic impact, especially on what we call the Defense and Repair node of the body. Cortisol is the body’s primary anti-inflammatory. It is supposed to be the fire extinguisher. But when cortisol is chronically elevated, the body’s receptors start to become resistant to it. It is just like insulin resistance. The signal is loud, but the cells aren't listening anymore.

This leads to some serious issues. First, let’s look at gut permeability, or leaky gut. Cortisol directly affects the tight junctions in the small intestine. When those junctions open up, undigested food and toxins can leak into the bloodstream, triggering more inflammation and more stress. It becomes a vicious cycle.

Then there is the immune system. Chronic stress suppresses something called Secretory IgA, or sIgA. Think of sIgA as the border patrol of your gut and your respiratory tract. It is your first line of defense. When sIgA is low, your clients will tell you that they catch every cold that goes around. They are constantly getting sick because their front-line defenses are down.

And of course, we can't forget the thyroid. High cortisol inhibits the conversion of T4, the inactive thyroid hormone, into T3, the active form. It also increases the production of Reverse T3, which acts like a brake on your metabolism. This is how you end up with functional hypothyroidism, where the client has all the symptoms of a slow thyroid, but their TSH looks perfectly normal on a standard lab test.

As a practitioner, understanding these connections gives you a huge advantage. Many of the coaches I mentor find that offering a simple four-week stress reset is a fantastic way to start working with new clients. You can price this as an entry-level program, and by the time they finish those four weeks, they have usually seen such a dramatic improvement in their sleep and their mood that they are ready to commit to a full transformation. They see that you aren't just guessing; you are working with the fundamental laws of their biology.

So, let’s recap the big ideas we have covered today. Remember that the HPA axis is a top-down signaling system. Most of the time, what we call adrenal issues are actually brain-based adaptations. It is HPA Axis Dysregulation, not gland failure.

The Cortisol Awakening Response is your most sensitive marker for how resilient that system is. You want to see that healthy fifty percent rise in the morning. If you don't see it, you need to look at light exposure and circadian rhythms.

When it comes to testing, remember the difference between free and metabolized cortisol. Saliva tells you what is available right now; urine tells you the total production over the day. Both are pieces of the puzzle.

And finally, never forget the systemic reach of cortisol. It touches the gut, it touches the immune system, and it definitely touches the thyroid. You cannot treat these things in isolation. You have to look at the whole person and the whole system.

I want to encourage you to really sit with these concepts. Look at the HPA axis as a protective system that is doing its best to keep your client safe in a high-stress world. Your job is to help the body feel safe again so it can turn that signal back up and return to a state of balance.

You are doing great work. This is high-level material, and by mastering it, you are putting yourself in the top tier of health practitioners. I am so excited to see how you apply this with your clients. I will see you in the next lesson.
