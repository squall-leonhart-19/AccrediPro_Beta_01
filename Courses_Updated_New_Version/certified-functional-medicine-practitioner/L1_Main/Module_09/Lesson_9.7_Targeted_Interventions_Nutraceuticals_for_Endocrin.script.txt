Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you’ve joined me for this lesson. We are moving into a really exciting phase of our curriculum. In our last session, we spent a lot of time establishing what I call the "Optimize" foundations. We talked about sleep, light exposure, movement, and the basic dietary rhythms that keep the human body in check. But as you know, sometimes lifestyle changes aren't quite enough to move the needle for a client who is already in a state of deep physiological depletion. 

That is why today, we are officially moving into the "Target" phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™. This is where we start using high-potency nutraceuticals. We aren't just using these to supplement a poor diet. We are using them as bridge therapy. We use them to span the gap between where the client is right now—which is often a state of dysfunction—and where we want them to be, which is a state of true physiological resilience. 

I want to start by talking about the power of targeted restoration. This is one of the most practical lessons we offer because this is where the rubber meets the road in your clinical practice. As a Functional Medicine Practitioner, your value isn't just in knowing which herbs are "good for hormones." Your value lies in your ability to select the right nutraceutical, at the right dose, for the right duration. That is what separates a professional clinical result from what I call "amateur supplement guessing." 

We’ve all seen the clients who come in with a bag full of twenty different bottles they bought at the health food store because they read a blog post or saw a TikTok. Usually, they feel no different than when they started. Our goal today is to give you the clinical precision to change that. We are going to look at how to modulate the entire endocrine web, with a heavy focus on the HPA axis, estrogen metabolism, and metabolic signaling.

By the time we finish this session, you’re going to be able to apply evidence-based botanicals like Ashwagandha and Rhodiola based on specific cortisol phenotypes. You’ll be able to design detox protocols for estrogen using things like DIM and Sulforaphane. You’ll understand the "why" behind using Berberine and Inositol for PCOS. And most importantly, you’ll know how to sequence these interventions so you don’t overwhelm your client’s system.

Let’s start with a story to ground these concepts. I want to tell you about a client of mine named Sarah—yes, we share a name. Sarah was 47 years old, a high-powered attorney, and right in the thick of perimenopause. She came to me because she was "tired but wired." That’s a term we use a lot, isn't it? She was exhausted all day, relying on three or four cups of coffee just to get through her depositions. But then, at night, she couldn't shut her brain off. She’d finally fall asleep at 11 PM, only to wake up wide awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling and worrying about her caseload. 

On top of the insomnia, she was dealing with new mid-section weight gain that wouldn't budge, heavy and painful periods, and a level of irritability that she said was starting to affect her relationship with her kids. She told me, "Sarah, I rely on caffeine to start my day and wine to stop it." 

When we looked at her labs, the data told a very clear story. Her salivary cortisol showed a "flipped" curve. She had a depressed morning curve—which explained why she felt like a zombie at 8 AM—and an elevated nighttime curve, which explained that 3 AM wake-up call. When we did her DUTCH testing, we saw that her estrogen metabolism was a mess. She was pushing her estrogen down the 4-OH pathway—which we know is the "pro-carcinogenic" or "red light" pathway—and she had very poor methylation. 

Now, a conventional approach might have just been to put her on an antidepressant or perhaps jump straight to high-dose HRT. But in the Target phase, we looked deeper. We didn't jump to hormones yet. Instead, we targeted her HPA axis. We used Phosphatidylserine and Holy Basil in the evening to blunt that nighttime cortisol spike. We supported her liver’s Phase II detox with Sulforaphane to help her clear out those toxic estrogen metabolites. 

The result? Within six weeks, she reported her first full night of sleep in over two years. Her PMS irritability dropped by about 40%. She didn't need the wine to "stop" anymore because her nervous system wasn't screaming at her. That is the power of targeting the root cause rather than just chasing symptoms.

Let’s dive into the HPA axis support first. When we talk about the HPA axis, we have to talk about adaptogens. This is a unique class of herbal medicines that increase what we call the "state of non-specific resistance" to stress. Think of adaptogens like a thermostat for the stress response. If the response is too high, they bring it down. If it's too low, they help nudge it up. 

But here is the professional secret: we don't just "give adaptogens." We match the botanical to the client's specific cortisol rhythm. If you give a stimulating adaptogen to someone who is already "wired," you’re going to make them feel worse. 

Let’s look at the "Big Three": Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, and Holy Basil. 

Ashwagandha is a powerhouse. Research, including a notable 2012 randomized controlled trial, showed that high-concentration Ashwagandha root extract can reduce serum cortisol levels by nearly 28% over 60 days. It is what we call anxiolytic and GABA-mimetic. This makes it perfect for the "Wired and Anxious" client. It’s calming. However, a little clinical pearl for you: be careful with Ashwagandha in cases of hyperthyroidism, as it can actually increase T4 levels. 

Then we have Rhodiola Rosea. Rhodiola is much more stimulating. It supports our monoamines—things like dopamine and norepinephrine. I like to use Rhodiola for the "Tired and Depressed" phenotype. These are the clients who can’t get off the couch. You want to use this in the morning. If you give Rhodiola at night, your client will be cleaning their kitchen at 2 AM, and they won't be happy with you the next day.

Third, we have Holy Basil, also known as Tulsi. This is my go-to for "Metabolic Stress." Holy Basil is excellent at modulating cortisol, but it also has a profound effect on glycemic control. If you have a client who gets "hangry" or has blood sugar spikes when they're stressed, Holy Basil is your best friend.

I want to pause here and give you a tip about the 3 PM energy crash. We see this all the time. A client says, "Sarah, I hit a wall at 3 PM." Before you reach for a stimulating herb like Rhodiola, check their blood sugar. Often, that crash isn't a primary adrenal issue; it’s a reactive hypoglycemia event. Their blood sugar spiked at lunch and then came crashing down. If their blood sugar is stable and they still have that crash, that’s when we look at something like Licorice Root. Licorice inhibits the enzyme that breaks down cortisol, effectively extending its half-life. It gives them a gentle, natural lift without the jitters of another cup of coffee.

Now, let’s shift gears and talk about Estrogen Biotransformation. We’ve discussed Estrogen Dominance in previous lessons, but today we’re talking about the "how" of fixing it. We want to use nutraceuticals to shift the metabolism of estrogen away from the 16-OH and 4-OH pathways—which can be inflammatory and even proliferative—and toward the protective 2-OH pathway.

You’ve probably heard of DIM, or Diindolylmethane. It’s a metabolite of the compounds found in broccoli and kale. DIM is fantastic because it specifically promotes that 2-hydroxylation of estrogen. I use this a lot for women in perimenopause who have those heavy, painful periods and breast tenderness. 

But—and this is a big "but"—you cannot use DIM in a vacuum. I see so many practitioners make the mistake of giving DIM without supporting Phase II detox. If you use DIM to push estrogen into the detox pathway, but the "exit door" of the liver is locked, you create a bottleneck. This can actually make the client feel worse. 

That’s where Sulforaphane comes in. Sulforaphane, usually derived from broccoli seed extract, induces Phase II enzymes, specifically Glutathione S-transferase. It helps conjugate those estrogen metabolites so they can actually leave the body. 

And we can’t forget the gut. This is where Calcium-D-Glucarate comes in. I call this the "secret weapon" for the gut-estrogen connection. There is an enzyme in the gut called beta-glucuronidase. Some "bad" bacteria produce this enzyme, and its job is to "un-couple" the estrogen that your liver worked so hard to package for excretion. Once it’s un-coupled, the estrogen gets reabsorbed into the bloodstream. It’s like the garbage man taking your trash out to the curb, and then someone else coming by, ripping the bags open, and throwing the trash back into your house. Calcium-D-Glucarate inhibits that enzyme, making sure the estrogen actually stays in the "trash" and leaves the body.

Moving on to metabolic stability, because let’s be honest: you cannot balance hormones in a body that has out-of-control insulin. For clients with PCOS or insulin resistance, we have two heavy hitters: Berberine and Myo-inositol.

Berberine is often called the "metabolic master switch." It activates an enzyme called AMPK. This is the same enzyme that gets activated when you exercise or fast. It tells the cells to stop storing fat and start burning it for energy. A major meta-analysis of 27 studies actually found that Berberine was just as effective as the drug Metformin at reducing blood glucose and HbA1c, but it had an even better effect on cholesterol and lipids. 

One thing to remember about Berberine: it’s also a very potent antimicrobial. Because it can shift the microbiome, I don't recommend staying on it forever. I usually suggest a "5 days on, 2 days off" schedule, or perhaps a 12-week cycle followed by a month-long break. We want the metabolic benefits without over-suppressing the good bacteria in the gut.

Then we have Myo-inositol. In PCOS, the problem is often a signaling failure. The insulin is there, but the cell isn't "hearing" the message. Myo-inositol acts as a second messenger. It helps the cell hear the insulin signal. Research shows that using a 40-to-1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol can help restore ovulation and improve egg quality. It’s a game-changer for fertility cases.

Now, let’s talk briefly about the Thyroid. This is an area where there is a lot of debate: Botanicals versus Glandulars. 

If a client has subclinical hypothyroidism—meaning their TSH is between 2.5 and 5.0—botanicals are usually the safest first step. Herbs like Guggul and Ashwagandha help the body convert T4, the inactive hormone, into T3, the active version. And we can't forget the basics: Selenium and Zinc. Without those two minerals, your deiodinase enzymes—the ones that do the conversion—simply won't work.

Glandulars, which are desiccated animal tissues, are a bit more controversial. They provide organ-specific nutrients and tiny amounts of hormones. I find them very useful for providing the building blocks for a client’s own gland to recover. But here is my big warning: Always, always screen for Hashimoto’s before you use stimulating thyroid nutrients. If you give high-dose iodine or aggressive thyroid support to someone with an active autoimmune flare, you are essentially pouring gasoline on a fire. You have to check those TPO antibodies first.

This brings me to the most important part of today’s lesson: Clinical Sequencing. This is where most new practitioners trip up. They see a client with ten symptoms, and they want to give ten different supplements. If you give a client 12 bottles of pills on day one, they are going to feel overwhelmed, their stomach might hurt, and they’ll likely quit within a week.

We have to be strategic. We follow the R.O.O.T.S. priority.

In Month 1, we focus on Metabolic and HPA stability. This means we’re looking at Berberine, Inositol, Magnesium, and Adaptogens. Why? Because you cannot fix sex hormones in a body that thinks it is being chased by a bear or that it's starving. We have to signal safety to the brain first.

In Month 2, we move to Biotransformation. This is when we bring in the DIM, the Sulforaphane, and the Calcium-D-Glucarate. We clear the "backlog" of old, recirculating hormones. Think of it like cleaning out the pipes before you turn the water on full blast.

Only in Month 3 do we move into Axis-Specific Modulation. This is when we might add specific thyroid support or herbs like Vitex for progesterone or Saw Palmetto for testosterone. 

I want you to remember something: As a Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner, you aren't just selling supplements. You are selling a clinical strategy. A targeted three-month protocol might cost a client a few hundred dollars. Your value lies in the fact that you are saving them from wasting thousands of dollars on the wrong products that might actually be making their imbalance worse. This level of expertise is why high-level practitioners can easily charge $250 or more just for that initial strategy session.

Before we wrap up, let’s do a quick mental check of what we’ve covered. 

First, remember to match your adaptogens to the client’s rhythm. Use Rhodiola for that low morning energy and Ashwagandha or Holy Basil for those high evening spikes. 

Second, always "fix the exit before the entry." Make sure the liver and gut are supported before you start aggressively shifting hormone pathways with things like DIM.

Third, remember that AMPK is the key to metabolic health. Berberine is a powerful tool here, but use it in cycles to protect the microbiome.

Fourth, sequence matters. Blood sugar and stress come first. Sex hormones and thyroid come later.

And finally, safety first. Always screen for autoimmunity before you start playing with high-dose iodine or glandulars.

You are doing incredible work. Taking the time to understand these biochemical pathways is what is going to make you an elite practitioner. It’s not just about knowing what a supplement does; it’s about knowing when the body is ready to receive it.

I want you to take a look at the case studies we’ve provided in the written materials and see if you can spot the patterns we talked about today. Think about your current clients—or even yourself—and ask: "Where are we in the sequencing? Have we built the metabolic foundation yet?"

Great work today. You are one step closer to mastering the art and science of functional restoration. I’ll see you in the next lesson, where we’ll dive even deeper into the "Sync" phase of our method. Keep going, you're doing great. See you in the next lesson.
