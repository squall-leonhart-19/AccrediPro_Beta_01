Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here for this lesson. We have already done some heavy lifting in this module by mastering the thyroid and the adrenal axes. Those are the foundations. But today, we are going to integrate the final piece of what I call the Endocrine Trio. We are talking about the sex hormones. This is where we really start to see the big picture of how a client’s mood, their metabolism, and even their long-term longevity are all woven together.

For so many practitioners, sex hormones feel like this incredibly complex, shifting puzzle. You’ve probably seen it in your practice already. You have a client, maybe a woman in her late 40s or early 50s, who comes to you and says she just feels off. She’s tired, she’s irritable, and she’s gaining weight around her middle for no apparent reason. She goes to her primary doctor, they run a standard lab panel, and they tell her everything is normal. But she knows it isn't.

In this lesson, we are going to move far beyond those simple high or low lab markers. We’re going to look at the signaling pathways and the metabolic breakdown of these hormones. We’re going to look at the systemic triggers that define what true hormonal harmony actually looks like. Whether you are helping a woman navigate the choppy waters of perimenopause or helping a man reclaim his vitality and drive, this framework is going to be your roadmap.

By the time we finish today, I want you to be able to do a few specific things. First, I want you to be able to evaluate the nuances of estrogen dominance. We aren't just going to look at total estrogen; we’re going to look at it through the lens of Phase One and Phase Two liver detoxification. You’re also going to learn how to identify the clinical markers for progesterone deficiency and understand how that impact ripples out into the brain and the nervous system. We’ll dive into male andropause, specifically looking at aromatization and why simply giving more testosterone isn't always the answer. We’ll map all of this to the Organize phase of our R.O.O.T.S. Method, with a huge focus on the estrobolome. And finally, we are going to deconstruct PCOS. We’re going to stop looking at it as just an ovarian issue and start seeing it as the multi-systemic metabolic disorder that it truly is.

So, let’s start with the Estrogen Matrix. In functional medicine, we don’t just ask the question, how much estrogen does she have? That’s a very surface-level question. Instead, we ask, how is she processing that estrogen? This is a vital distinction. You will find that estrogen dominance is very often not a result of the body overproducing estrogen. Instead, it’s a result of poor clearance. The body is making it just fine, but it’s getting stuck on the way out.

This clearance happens primarily in the liver through two very distinct phases. Think of Phase One as the branching paths. This is called hydroxylation. The liver takes that estrogen and breaks it down into three different metabolites. The ratio of these three metabolites determines the estrogenic burden on the body. It’s like a fork in the road with three possible directions.

The first path is the 2-OH pathway. We call this the protective pathway. When the liver favors this route, it’s generally associated with a much lower risk of hormone-sensitive issues. This is where we want most of that estrogen to go.

The second path is the 4-OH pathway. This is the one we keep a close eye on. We call it the risky pathway because these metabolites can form something called quinones. If those aren't properly neutralized, they can actually damage DNA.

The third path is the 16-OH pathway. This is the proliferative pathway. It is very strongly estrogenic. When a client has high levels of 16-OH, you’re going to see it in their symptoms. They’ll have very heavy periods, significant breast tenderness, or perhaps they are dealing with fibroids.

Now, here is the clinical pearl. If a client has high 16-OH or 4-OH, we don’t just try to block their estrogen. That’s a blunt instrument approach. Instead, we use targeted nutrients like DIM or sulforaphane to gently push the liver toward that 2-OH pathway. This is the difference between just suppressing a symptom and actually optimizing a biochemical process.

But Phase One is only half the story. Once those metabolites are created, they have to go through Phase Two, which is methylation. This is where the COMT enzyme comes in. I like to think of the COMT enzyme as the gatekeeper. Its job is to make those estrogen metabolites water-soluble so the body can finally get rid of them.

If a client has a slow COMT enzyme—and this could be because of their genetics or simply because they are low in key nutrients like magnesium and B12—those estrogen metabolites can’t get through the gate. They end up re-circulating in the bloodstream. This is why a woman can have classic symptoms of estrogen dominance even if her total estrogen production is actually quite low. She’s just recycling the same old estrogen over and over again.

Now, let’s talk about the partner to estrogen, which is progesterone. I often call progesterone the calm hormone. It has this incredible ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and modulate our GABA receptors. If you remember from our earlier modules, GABA is our primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. It’s what helps us feel relaxed and grounded.

When progesterone is low, clients don’t just have cycle issues. They experience what I call the tired but wired state. They have insomnia, they feel mid-cycle anxiety, and they just can’t seem to turn their brains off at night.

I want to share a story with you about a client named Sarah. She was a 46-year-old Registered Nurse who was actually in the process of transitioning into health coaching. She came to me because she was struggling with severe PMS and insomnia. She’d gained about 15 pounds, mostly in her abdomen, and she felt like she was living in a constant state of brain fog.

When we looked at her labs, her estradiol actually looked normal for her age. But her progesterone was at the very bottom of the range. Now, if we had just looked at the hormones, we might have just given her some progesterone and called it a day. But using the R.O.O.T.S. Method, we dug deeper. We identified that she had very high evening cortisol. Her HPA axis was completely dysregulated from years of shift work and the stress of starting a new business.

Her body was actually prioritizing the production of cortisol over progesterone. In the functional medicine world, we sometimes call this the pregnenolone steal. Her body was in survival mode. It didn’t care about reproduction or cycle comfort; it cared about managing stress. By addressing her stress architecture first and adding in a little bit of Vitex, or Chasteberry, to support her natural production, her cycle lengthened and her sleep was restored within just two cycles. She didn't need a heavy intervention; she needed her body to stop stealing its own resources.

Now, let’s shift gears for a moment and talk about the men. Male hormonal decline, or andropause, is rarely as simple as just having low testosterone. As functional practitioners, we have to look at a process called aromatization. This is where the body takes testosterone and converts it into estrogen, specifically estradiol.

There are a few big triggers for this aromatase trap. The first is insulin resistance. High levels of insulin actually stimulate the aromatase enzyme in the adipose tissue. This is why men with more abdominal fat often have higher estrogen levels. It becomes a vicious cycle. The more estrogen they have, the easier it is to gain fat, and the more fat they have, the more they aromatize their testosterone.

Another factor is SHBG, or Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. If this is high, it binds to the testosterone and makes it unavailable to the body. So a man might have a decent total testosterone number, but his free testosterone—the stuff that actually does the work—is incredibly low.

We also have to look at zinc. Zinc is a vital co-factor for testosterone production, but it also acts as a natural aromatase inhibitor. And we can’t forget about alcohol. Alcohol is directly toxic to the cells in the testes that produce testosterone, and it simultaneously increases estrogen. So, when you’re working with a male client, don’t just look at the T levels. Look at the insulin, look at the zinc, and look at the lifestyle factors that are driving that conversion.

Next, I want to talk about PCOS, or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. This is one of the most frequently mismanaged conditions in all of medicine. It’s often treated as a fertility issue, but in functional medicine, we recognize it as a metabolic-endocrine hybrid. Research shows that up to 70 percent of PCOS cases actually go undiagnosed because practitioners are too focused on looking for physical cysts on the ovaries rather than looking at the underlying signaling.

When you are in the Reveal phase of your assessment for a PCOS client, you need to look for hyperinsulinemia. High insulin is the primary driver here. It tells the ovaries to produce excess androgens, like testosterone and DHEA. Those high androgens then make the insulin resistance even worse. It’s a perfect storm.

You also want to look at inflammation. If you see an elevated CRP on a lab, it often correlates with the severity of symptoms like acne or unwanted hair growth. When you’re working with these clients, I always recommend starting with a metabolic-first approach. Inositol is a fantastic tool here, specifically a 40-to-1 ratio of Myo and D-Chiro inositol. It improves insulin sensitivity right at the level of the follicle. In many cases, it’s actually more effective at restoring ovulation than standard medications, and it doesn't come with the GI side effects.

Now, we cannot talk about sex hormones without talking about the gut. This is the Estrobolome connection. The estrobolome is a specific collection of bacteria in the gut that is responsible for metabolizing and circulating estrogen.

There is an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase that certain gut bacteria produce. Now, normally, the liver does its job, neutralizes the estrogen, and sends it to the gut to be eliminated. But if a client has high levels of beta-glucuronidase, that enzyme actually un-couples the estrogen. It rips it back apart and allows it to be re-absorbed into the bloodstream. This is a massive driver of estrogen dominance. This is why you can do all the liver support in the world, but if your client is constipated or has gut dysbiosis, they are never going to get their hormones in balance. Bowel regularity is quite literally a hormone intervention.

As we move toward the Organize phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method, I want you to start mapping all of this data across the functional medicine matrix.

Under Biotransformation, you’re going to look at those Phase One and Phase Two estrogen markers. Under Communication, you’re looking at the HPG axis—the signaling between the brain and the gonads. Under Assimilation, you’re looking at the gut, the beta-glucuronidase levels, and the frequency of bowel movements. And under Defense and Repair, you’re looking for any autoimmune triggers or systemic inflammation that might be throwing the whole system off.

Let’s do a quick mental check to make sure these concepts are sticking. Think about which estrogen metabolite we called protective. That’s the 2-OH pathway. Think about how the estrobolome contributes to dominance. It’s through that re-absorption process we just talked about. Why is progesterone low in stressed people? Because of that resource shift toward cortisol. And what is the metabolic driver of PCOS? It’s almost always insulin.

I know we’ve covered a lot of ground today, so let’s summarize the big takeaways.

First, remember that estrogen balance is just as much about detoxification as it is about production. You always have to assess Phase One and Phase Two.

Second, think of progesterone as your client’s neurological buffer. If they are anxious and can’t sleep, look at their progesterone levels and their HPA axis.

Third, for your male clients, focus on inhibiting that aromatase enzyme and improving insulin sensitivity before you jump to other interventions.

Fourth, never forget the estrobolome. The gut and the hormones are inseparable.

And finally, with PCOS, always take a metabolic-first approach. If you stabilize the blood sugar, the androgens will often follow suit.

You are doing incredible work by diving into these nuances. It’s this level of detail that is going to set you apart as a practitioner and truly help your clients find the answers they’ve been looking for.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
