            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt) hypothesis in functional endocrinology suggests that during chronic stress, the body prioritizes the production of which hormone at the expense of DHEA and sex hormones?",
            "options": ["Aldosterone", "Cortisol", "Progesterone", "Androstenedione"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic HPA axis activation prioritizes cortisol production to ensure survival, diverting the precursor pregnenolone away from the production of DHEA and subsequent sex hormones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "When evaluating thyroid health 'Beyond the TSH,' a high level of Reverse T3 (rT3) is most often a physiological adaptation to what condition?",
            "options": ["Iodine toxicity", "Excessive carbohydrate intake", "Systemic inflammation or chronic calorie restriction", "Primary hypothyroidism"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 acts as a 'brake' on metabolism; it increases during times of significant stress, systemic inflammation, or severe calorie restriction as the body attempts to conserve energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'tired but wired' sensation in the evening and difficulty falling asleep. Which salivary cortisol pattern is most likely to be observed?",
            "options": ["Flat diurnal curve with low morning cortisol", "Elevated Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)", "Elevated evening cortisol", "Low mid-day cortisol with normal evening levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'tired but wired' phenomenon is a classic sign of HPA axis dysregulation where cortisol fails to drop appropriately in the evening, interfering with melatonin production and sleep onset."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In Phase 1 Estrogen Metabolism, which hydroxylation pathway is considered the most 'protective' due to its weak estrogenic activity and lower risk of DNA damage?",
            "options": ["2-OH pathway", "4-OH pathway", "16-OH pathway", "10-OH pathway"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH) pathway is considered the 'green light' or protective pathway, whereas the 4-OH and 16-OH pathways are associated with higher DNA damage and proliferative risks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on metabolic hormones, which biomarker is often the earliest indicator of developing insulin resistance, rising years before fasting blood glucose exceeds 100 mg/dL?",
            "options": ["HbA1c", "Fasting Insulin", "Triglycerides", "Post-prandial glucose"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fasting insulin typically rises as a compensatory mechanism to keep blood glucose stable; therefore, hyperinsulinemia is often detectable long before fasting glucose or HbA1c become pathological."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical has been shown in clinical trials to be as effective as Metformin in improving insulin sensitivity and ovulation rates in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Berberine", "Myo-inositol", "Magnesium Glycinate", "Vitex (Chaste Tree Berry)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myo-inositol acts as a second messenger for insulin signaling, and meta-analyses have shown it to be comparable to Metformin for PCOS management with fewer side effects."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "The Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), measured 30 minutes after waking, is a specific marker for the health of which neurological structure's influence on the HPA axis?",
            "options": ["Amygdala", "Cerebellum", "Hippocampus", "Prefrontal Cortex"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CAR is a unique aspect of the HPA axis that reflects the integrity of the hippocampus and the body's ability to prepare for the day's perceived stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client reports heavy menses, breast tenderness, and irritability during the luteal phase. Her labs show normal Estradiol but Progesterone at the bottom of the reference range. What is the functional term for this?",
            "options": ["Absolute Estrogen Dominance", "Relative Estrogen Dominance", "Primary Ovarian Failure", "Androgen Excess"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relative Estrogen Dominance occurs when estrogen levels may be within the 'normal' range, but progesterone is insufficient to balance estrogen's effects, leading to symptomatic hormone imbalance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Which specific nutrient is required for the 5'-deiodinase enzyme to convert T4 (inactive) into T3 (active)?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Selenium", "Vitamin C", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a critical cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes that remove an iodine atom from T4 to create the metabolically active T3."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In the 'Sustaining Endocrine Resilience' lesson, which lifestyle intervention was identified as having the most significant impact on resetting the circadian rhythm and morning cortisol production?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Cold plunging at night", "Viewing natural sunlight within 30 minutes of waking", "Eliminating all dietary lectins"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Early morning sunlight exposure triggers the melanopsin receptors in the eyes, signaling the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to stimulate the Cortisol Awakening Response and set the timer for melatonin release 12-14 hours later."
