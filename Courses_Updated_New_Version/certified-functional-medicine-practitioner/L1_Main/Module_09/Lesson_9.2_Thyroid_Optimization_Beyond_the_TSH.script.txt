Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you have joined me for this lesson. Today, we are diving into one of the most critical, yet often misunderstood, areas of functional medicine: the thyroid. In our previous lesson, we looked at the broad web of hormones and how they all interact. But today, we are going to zoom in on what I call the master controller of metabolism. We are going to apply the R.O.O.T.S. Method to uncover why standard medical screening so often fails the very people we are trying to help.

If there is one area where functional medicine truly shines, it is thyroid health. I want you to think about the women who will eventually come to see you. Many of them have been told for years that their thyroid is fine. Their doctor ran a single test, told them the results were normal, and sent them on their way. Yet, these women are struggling. They are gaining weight despite eating well. They are dealing with brain fog so thick they can’t remember where they put their keys. Their hair is thinning, and they feel cold all the time. 

As a practitioner, this is where you provide immense value. This lesson is designed to give you the clinical expertise to look far beyond that single test. We are going to explore the functional imbalances that conventional labs almost always overlook. By the end of our time today, you will be able to analyze the limitations of standard screening and understand why a full thyroid panel is a non-negotiable part of your practice. We will map thyroid dysfunction across the Functional Medicine Matrix and look at the physiological triggers that cause conversion issues. We will also distinguish between primary hypothyroidism and the autoimmune patterns of Hashimoto’s, and we will wrap up by looking at the specific nutrients that keep this whole system running.

Let’s start with what I call the TSH Trap. In conventional medicine, the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, or TSH, is often the only marker tested. But here is the thing you have to explain to your clients: TSH is a pituitary hormone. It is not actually a thyroid hormone. It reflects the pituitary gland’s perception of what is happening in the blood. It does not necessarily reflect the reality of what is happening inside the cells. 

There is a massive gap between what is considered normal and what is actually optimal. Conventional lab ranges for TSH are often very wide, sometimes going as high as 4.5 or even 5.0. But the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has noted that most truly healthy individuals have a TSH between 0.4 and 2.5. When a client tells you their doctor said their labs are normal, I want your response to be prepared. You can say, Normal just means you aren’t in a state of acute, end-stage disease. But we aren’t looking for the absence of disease. We are looking for optimal health. We want you to feel vibrant, not just technically alive. This simple reframing builds immediate trust. It shows the client that you see them and that you understand why they still feel terrible despite their normal results.

To truly reveal what is going on, we have to look at the entire pathway. This is the R in our R.O.O.T.S. Method. A functional thyroid panel is much more than just TSH. We need to see the Free T4, which is the pro-hormone the thyroid produces. We need the Free T3, which is the active hormone that actually does the work in the cells. We also need to look at Reverse T3, which acts like a brake on the system, and we must check for TPO antibodies to see if the immune system is attacking the gland.

Think of the thyroid like a delivery system. TSH is the boss at headquarters sending out an order. Free T4 is the delivery truck carrying the goods. But that truck has to be unloaded and the goods have to be used. Free T3 is the actual product being used by the customer. If you only look at the boss’s order, you have no idea if the truck broke down or if the customer actually received the goods.

This brings us to the T4 to T3 conversion conundrum. The thyroid gland primarily produces T4, which is relatively inactive. For the body to use this, it must be converted into T3 via enzymes called deiodinases. Most of this conversion doesn't even happen in the thyroid. It happens in the liver, the gut, and the peripheral tissues. 

If a client has a normal TSH and normal T4, but their T3 is low, they don't have a thyroid gland problem. They have a conversion problem. This is a huge distinction. You can give that person all the thyroid medication in the world, but if they can't convert it, they will still feel exhausted. This conversion is often blocked by three main things: chronic stress, gut dysbiosis, and liver congestion. 

When cortisol is high because of stress, it inhibits the enzymes that do the conversion. In the gut, about twenty percent of T4 to T3 conversion happens via an enzyme called intestinal sulfatase. If the microbiome is out of balance, that conversion doesn't happen efficiently. And since the liver is the primary site of conversion, any burden on the liver—whether from environmental toxins or poor diet—slows down the whole metabolic signal.

I want to share a story with you about a client named Sarah. She was forty-eight and a former teacher who was trying to pivot into health coaching. She came to me because she was dealing with extreme fatigue and cold hands and feet. She had gained fifteen pounds in a very short amount of time even though she was eating a very clean diet. Her doctor had run a TSH test, which came back at 3.8. Her doctor told her she was fine and that maybe she was just getting older.

When we ran a full functional panel, the picture changed completely. Her TSH was technically in the normal range, but her Free T3 was very low, and her Reverse T3 was very high. Her body was making T4, but instead of converting it into the active T3 she needed for energy, it was shunting it into Reverse T3. We focused on her gut health and added some targeted selenium to support those conversion enzymes. Within three weeks, her energy started to return. She wasn't just a patient anymore; she became a specialist herself, helping other teachers overcome that same kind of burnout.

Let’s talk more about that Reverse T3, because it is a marker many practitioners miss. I want you to think of Free T3 as the gas pedal for your metabolism and Reverse T3 as the brake. They both compete for the same parking spots, or receptors, on your cells. When the body is under significant stress, it strategically increases Reverse T3 to slow everything down. It is a survival mechanism. Your body thinks you are in a famine or running from a predator, so it tries to conserve energy. 

In our modern world, we aren't usually running from tigers, but our bodies react to chronic work stress and poor sleep in the same way. The brake stays stuck on. Research has shown that elevated Reverse T3 is actually a very strong predictor of systemic distress. When you see this in a client, you can tell them, Your body is brilliant. It is trying to save your life by slowing you down. Our job isn't to force the thyroid to work harder. Our job is to tell your body that the danger has passed.

Now, let’s organize these findings using the Functional Medicine Matrix. This is the O in our R.O.O.T.S. Method. We have to look at how the thyroid interacts with the rest of the body. Under Assimilation, we look at the gut. Is there enough stomach acid to absorb the minerals the thyroid needs? Is dysbiosis preventing that twenty percent of conversion we talked about? 

Under Defense and Repair, we look at the immune system. If antibodies are present, we are dealing with Hashimoto’s. This is an immune system problem, not just a thyroid problem. You cannot fix Hashimoto’s by only looking at the thyroid; you have to calm the immune system. 

Under Biotransformation, we look at the liver. Is it overwhelmed by toxins? If the liver is busy processing chemicals from the environment, it might deprioritize thyroid hormone conversion. And finally, under Communication, we look at how the HPA axis—your stress response—is talking to the HPT axis, which is your thyroid response. They are constantly communicating, and if one is screaming, the other will inevitably be affected.

This leads us to the actual raw materials the thyroid needs. The enzymes that govern thyroid health are nutrient-dependent. If the body doesn't have the right tools, the machinery of metabolism just grinds to a halt. 

First, there is Iodine. This is the backbone of thyroid hormone. If you look at the names, T4 has four iodine atoms and T3 has three. It is literally built from iodine. However, we have to be careful. High doses of iodine can sometimes trigger a flare-up in people with Hashimoto’s. It is like adding gasoline to a fire that is already burning. We always want to test and be cautious with supplementation here.

Next is Selenium. This is critical for the enzymes that convert T4 to T3. It also helps produce glutathione peroxidase, which protects the thyroid gland from damage. When the thyroid makes hormone, it actually creates a bit of oxidative stress. Selenium acts like a shield that prevents that stress from damaging the gland itself.

Then we have Zinc. Zinc is required for the T3 receptor to actually bind to your DNA. Even if you have enough T3, if you don't have zinc, that T3 can't turn on the metabolic genes. It is like having a key but no hands to turn it in the lock.

Finally, we have to talk about Iron, specifically Ferritin, which is your stored iron. The enzyme that helps produce thyroid hormone is dependent on iron. If a client’s ferritin is low—and we usually like to see it between 50 and 70—the thyroid production often stalls. I see this so often in women in their forties who might have heavy cycles. They have low iron, which causes thyroid symptoms, but they are only being treated for the thyroid. You cannot fix the thyroid if the iron fuel is missing. Always check the ferritin.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to keep in your mind as you start working with clients. First, remember that TSH is a screening tool, not a diagnostic gold standard. It doesn't tell the whole story of what is happening at the cellular level. Second, a functional thyroid panel is essential. You need the Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, and those antibodies to see the full picture. 

Third, thyroid health is never just about the thyroid. It is a systemic issue that involves the liver, the gut, and the adrenal glands. If you only treat the gland, you are missing the root cause. Fourth, nutrient deficiencies like selenium, zinc, and iron are often the hidden reasons why people can't convert their hormones. And finally, remember that Hashimoto’s is the leading cause of hypothyroidism in the US. It requires an immune-centered approach, not just a hormone-replacement approach.

You are doing such important work by learning these nuances. When you can explain to a client why they feel the way they do, even when their other doctors said they were fine, you give them hope. You give them a roadmap back to themselves. 

Take some time to review these markers and think about how you might explain the gas pedal and the brake to a future client. Great work today. I will see you in the next lesson where we will keep digging deeper into these functional pathways. Until then, keep learning and keep growing.
