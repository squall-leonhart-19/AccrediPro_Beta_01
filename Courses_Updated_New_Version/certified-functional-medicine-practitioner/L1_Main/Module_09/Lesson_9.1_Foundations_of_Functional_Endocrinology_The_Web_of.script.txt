Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. Welcome to one of the most transformative lessons in our curriculum. Today, we are going to dive deep into the Web of Hormones. If you’ve ever felt like endocrinology was just a confusing list of glands and chemicals to memorize, I want you to take a deep breath. We are going to change your entire perspective. In this lesson, I’m going to teach you how to move away from the old way of thinking about hormones and embrace a functional model that actually gets results for your clients.

Hormones are almost always talked about as if they are isolated chemicals floating around in a vacuum. You’ve probably heard people say things like, oh, I have a thyroid problem, or my estrogen is low. But in the world of functional medicine, we don't see hormones that way. We see them as a dynamic, interconnected web of communication. Every single hormone in the body is talking to every other hormone. When you pull on one string of that web, the entire thing shifts. 

By the time we finish today, you’ll be able to move beyond the simple concept of hormone replacement. You’ll start addressing hormone signaling. You’re going to discover why a client’s thyroid issue is actually a stress problem or a gut problem in disguise. We’re going to map out the hormone hierarchy so you know exactly which hormones to prioritize first. We’ll walk through the entire lifecycle of a hormone, from production to detoxification. And finally, I’ll show you how to use the Reveal phase of our R.O.O.T.S. Method to uncover the subclinical shifts that conventional doctors often miss.

Let’s start with the big picture: The Functional Paradigm Shift. In conventional endocrinology, the focus is very binary. A doctor looks at a lab and asks, is this level high or is it low? If it’s low, the standard answer is usually replacement. We see this all the time with levothyroxine for the thyroid or estradiol for menopause. Now, don't get me wrong, sometimes replacement is necessary and life-saving. But that model often completely ignores the why. It’s a reactive approach, not a proactive one.

The functional medicine approach is different. We look at endocrinology through the lens of signaling. We don't just ask if there’s enough hormone. We ask four much deeper questions. First, is the gland actually receiving the signal to produce the hormone in the first place? Second, is that hormone actually reaching the target tissue? Third, are the cellular receptors listening to the signal? And fourth, is the body effectively clearing out the used hormones once they’ve done their job?

I like to use the Wi-Fi analogy when I explain this to clients. Think of hormones like a Wi-Fi signal in your house. You can have a powerful, expensive router—that’s your gland. But if there’s a lot of interference in the walls, like inflammation, or if you have the wrong password, which is like receptor resistance, your device still won't connect to the internet. Adding more routers or a stronger signal—which is what hormone replacement does—doesn't fix the interference in the walls. Our job as functional practitioners is to clear the interference and make sure the password matches. We want to fix the communication, not just boost the volume.

Now, let’s talk about the Hormone Hierarchy. This is a crucial concept because not all hormones are created equal when it comes to clinical priority. If you try to fix peripheral hormones like your sex hormones or your thyroid without addressing the foundational hormones, your results are going to be temporary at best. You’ll be spinning your wheels and your client will get frustrated.

At the very top of the hierarchy, we have the foundational hormones: Insulin and Cortisol. These are the heavy hitters. They are tied directly to our survival. Insulin manages our fuel and energy storage, while cortisol manages our stress response and survival. If these two are out of balance, the body doesn't care about your hair growth or your libido. It’s in survival mode. Blood sugar swings, belly fat, burnout, and systemic inflammation are all signs that the foundation is cracking.

Next down the ladder are the secondary hormones, specifically the thyroid hormones like T4 and T3. These regulate your metabolic rate and temperature. And at the bottom, we have the peripheral hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone, and Testosterone. These are the ones people usually want to fix first because they feel the symptoms of PMS or low libido so acutely. But here’s the secret: you cannot fix the thyroid or the sex hormones while the client is in a state of chronic stress or insulin resistance. 

Research actually back this up. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that high cortisol levels directly suppress the conversion of T4 into the active T3 thyroid hormone. This is a perfect example of the hierarchy in action. If you give a client thyroid medication but don't address their high stress levels, they still won't feel better because their body will keep blocking that hormone from becoming active. You have to start at the top.

To really apply the Reveal phase of our method, we have to understand the lifecycle of a hormone. I want you to imagine a hormone’s journey through the body as having four critical checkpoints. If there’s a breakdown at any one of these points, the client will feel symptomatic.

The first checkpoint is Production. This is the factory. Hormones don't just appear out of thin air; they require raw materials. Steroid hormones like cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone are actually made from cholesterol. This is why I get very concerned when I see clients on extremely low-fat diets or aggressive statin drugs. If you don't have enough cholesterol, you can't make your sex hormones. Thyroid hormones are different; they require iodine and an amino acid called tyrosine. If a client is missing these key micronutrients, the production line shuts down before it even starts.

The second checkpoint is Transport. I call this the delivery truck. Once a hormone is made, it doesn't just float freely in your blood. It’s carried by transport proteins, like Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, or SHBG, and Albumin. Here’s the catch: only the free hormones are biologically active. The ones bound to the transport proteins are basically in storage. 

I use the Bus Analogy for this. Imagine the total hormone level is everyone sitting on a bus. But the only people who can actually go to work are the ones who get off the bus. Those are your free hormones. If the bus doors are stuck shut—maybe because of high insulin or liver issues—no one gets off the bus, and no work gets done. You can have a client with normal total testosterone levels, but if their SHBG is too high, their free testosterone is low, and they’ll feel all the symptoms of a deficiency.

The third checkpoint is Sensitivity. This is where the cellular receptor lives. It’s the listener. Even if you have plenty of hormone being produced and transported, it won't matter if the cell is ignoring the signal. We call this receptor resistance. The most famous version of this is insulin resistance, where the cells become numb to insulin because they’ve been overexposed to it for too long. But we also see thyroid resistance and cortisol resistance. This is exactly why a client can walk into your office with perfect lab numbers but feel absolutely terrible. Their body is shouting, but the cells have their earplugs in.

The fourth and final checkpoint is Detoxification and Elimination. This is the trash service. Once a hormone has delivered its message, it has to be deactivated by the liver and then physically escorted out of the body through the gut. If the liver is sluggish or if the client is constipated, those hormones don't leave. They get reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. We see this most often with estrogen. If estrogen isn't cleared out, it recirculates, leading to a condition we call estrogen dominance. This is why I always say you can't fix hormones if the client isn't having a daily bowel movement. The pipes have to be clear.

Let’s bring this to life with a real-world example. I want to tell you about a client of mine named Sarah. She was 48 years old, a former educator who was actually transitioning into health coaching herself. She came to me because she was struggling with stubborn weight gain around her midsection, major energy crashes around 3 PM, brain fog, and very light, restless sleep. 

She had already gone to her GP, and they ran a TSH and a fasting glucose test. Her TSH was 2.4 and her glucose was 98. Her doctor told her everything was normal for her age and that she was probably just entering perimenopause. But Sarah knew something was wrong. 

When we moved into the Reveal phase, we looked deeper. We ran a functional blood panel and found that her fasting insulin was actually 18. Now, in the conventional world, anything under 25 is often considered normal. But in functional medicine, we want that number under five. We also found that her evening cortisol was elevated when it should have been dropping to prepare her for sleep. 

Sarah didn't have a thyroid deficiency. She had HPA axis dysregulation and significant insulin resistance. Her body was stuck in a survival loop. By addressing those foundational hormones—insulin and cortisol—through protein-forward nutrition and aligning her lifestyle with her circadian rhythms, everything changed. She didn't need a single hormone prescription. She lost 12 pounds in eight weeks, her brain fog lifted, and she got her life back. This is the power of looking at the whole web instead of just one strand.

Now, we also have to consider what is tugging on that web from the outside. There are two major disruptors you need to be aware of: Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals, or EDCs, and genetics. 

EDCs are everywhere. They are in the phthalates used in fragrances, the BPA in plastics, and the parabens in personal care products. These chemicals are hormone mimics. They are like uninvited guests who show up to a party and sit in the chairs reserved for your actual hormones. They can either trigger a false signal or block the real hormone from doing its job. A massive meta-analysis recently linked EDC exposure to a 24% increase in the risk of metabolic syndrome. This is a huge deal. 

As a coach, one of the highest-value services you can offer is an Environmental Health Audit. Helping a client swap out these chemicals in their home can have a profound impact on their hormonal health. In fact, many practitioners charge premium rates for these types of VIP deep dives because the clinical impact is so significant.

Then we have genetics. We look at things like SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms. Variations in genes like COMT, which affects how you metabolize estrogen, or DIO2, which affects thyroid conversion, can give us a roadmap of a client’s potential weak links. I always tell my clients that your genes are not your destiny, but they do load the gun. Environment and lifestyle pull the trigger. Knowing these genetic tendencies allows us to be much more surgical with our interventions.

So, how do we actually apply the Reveal phase beyond just looking at a TSH score? We use a combination of tools to see the patterns. We use functional blood chemistry to look at markers like insulin, hemoglobin A1C, ferritin, and full thyroid panels that include free T3 and reverse T3. We might use salivary or urinary mapping to look at the cortisol awakening response and see how the body is breaking down hormone metabolites. And we always, always use symptom tracking. We want to see how energy, mood, and menstrual cycles correlate with the data.

I know this can feel complex, but I don't want you to be intimidated. As a certified functional medicine practitioner, you aren't diagnosing endocrine disease. That’s for the doctors. Your job is to identify patterns of dysfunction. You are looking for where the communication has broken down. Your goal is to restore the terrain so the body’s natural intelligence can re-regulate the web on its own.

Before we wrap up, let’s go over a few key takeaways from today’s lesson. 

First, remember the Web Concept. Hormones never work in isolation. A shift in one, like cortisol, will always create a ripple effect across the entire system. 

Second, signaling is more important than replacement. Always focus on the communication between the glands and the cells. Don't just look at the absolute level of the hormone; look at the context.

Third, prioritize the foundation. You must address insulin and cortisol before you try to fine-tune the thyroid or sex hormones. If the foundation is unstable, the rest of the house will eventually crumble.

Fourth, use the four checkpoints. Whenever you’re looking at a client’s case, walk through production, transport, sensitivity, and detoxification. This systematic approach will help you find the true root cause.

And finally, reveal the subclinical. Use functional ranges to identify these shifts before they become full-blown pathology. This is where you provide the most value to your clients—catching things early and turning them around.

I want to leave you with a little bit of advice for your practice. When you’re explaining these concepts to a client, keep it simple. Use the analogies we talked about today. Use the Wi-Fi signal, the bus, and the factory. When a client understands the mechanism of why they feel the way they do, their compliance sky-rockets. They stop looking for a magic pill and start looking at their lifestyle as the ultimate medicine.

You are doing incredible work by learning these deeper connections. You’re moving from being a coach who just gives advice to a practitioner who truly understands the human bio-system. 

Great work today. Spend some time reviewing the hierarchy and the four checkpoints, and I’ll see you in the next lesson.
