            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Trigger is a discrete event (physical, emotional, or environmental) that initiates the onset of symptoms or a disease process. In this case, the viral infection was the initiating event."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Why is the 'Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual' (MES) core located at the center of the Functional Medicine Matrix?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is the only node that cannot be influenced by nutrition",
                "Because it is the last area a practitioner should address",
                "Because it represents the 'filter' through which all other physiological nodes are experienced and influenced",
                "Because it is legally required for certification purposes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MES core is central because a patient's beliefs, emotions, and spiritual health directly impact physiological function in every other node, and vice versa."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modifiable Lifestyle Factors are the foundation of the Matrix. Addressing sleep, nutrition, and stress often resolves imbalances in multiple physiological nodes simultaneously."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "The 'Biotransformation and Elimination' node is often referred to as the 'Detox' node. Beyond the liver, which of the following is a critical component of this node?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biotransformation involves both the chemical conversion of toxins (primarily in the liver) and their successful elimination from the body via the kidneys (urine), skin (sweat), and lungs (breath)."
