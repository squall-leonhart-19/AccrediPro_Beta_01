        {
            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "In the Electron Transport Chain (ETC), which complex is the only one that does not pump protons into the intermembrane space, making it a unique target for metabolic intervention?",
            "options": ["Complex I (NADH Dehydrogenase)", "Complex II (Succinate Dehydrogenase)", "Complex III (Cytochrome bc1 complex)", "Complex IV (Cytochrome c Oxidase)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complex II (Succinate Dehydrogenase) is unique because it is the only complex that does not pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane; it also serves as a direct link between the TCA cycle and the ETC."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR) model proposed by Dr. Robert Naviaux, which phase is characterized by the transition from 'defense' to 'proliferation' and the beginning of tissue remodeling?",
            "options": ["CDR1", "CDR2", "CDR3", "CDR4"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CDR2 is the 'Proliferation Phase' where cells stop defending and begin to replace lost biomass through cell division and metabolic shifts to support growth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Which phospholipid is found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is critical for the structural integrity of 'supercomplexes,' but is highly vulnerable to peroxidation?",
            "options": ["Phosphatidylcholine", "Phosphatidylserine", "Cardiolipin", "Sphingomyelin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cardiolipin is a unique mitochondrial phospholipid that anchors the ETC complexes into supercomplexes. Its high PUFA content makes it a primary target for oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial decay."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A patient's Organic Acids Test (OAT) shows significantly elevated levels of Ethylmalonate and Adipate. Which mitochondrial process is likely impaired, and which nutrient is the primary cofactor needed?",
            "options": ["Carbohydrate oxidation; Thiamine", "Fatty acid beta-oxidation; L-Carnitine", "TCA cycle; Alpha-lipoic acid", "Amino acid catabolism; Vitamin B6"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated dicarboxylic acids like adipate and ethylmalonate are classic markers of impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation, often requiring L-Carnitine for transport of fats into the mitochondria."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "The 'Randle Cycle' (Glucose-Fatty Acid Cycle) describes a metabolic competition. What occurs when fatty acid oxidation is high in the mitochondria?",
            "options": ["Glucose uptake and oxidation are inhibited", "Insulin sensitivity increases dramatically", "The TCA cycle stops completely", "Lactate is converted back to glucose via the Cori cycle"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Randle Cycle explains that high levels of fatty acid oxidation inhibit the utilization of glucose, which is a key mechanism behind metabolic inflexibility and physiological insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which transcription factor is triggered by hormetic stressors (like HIIT or cold exposure) to act as the 'master regulator' of mitochondrial biogenesis?",
            "options": ["NF-kB", "Nrf2", "PGC-1alpha", "HIF-1alpha"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PGC-1alpha (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) is the primary driver of mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing the number and efficiency of mitochondria in response to energy demand."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In the context of redox signaling, what is the primary role of the Nrf2 pathway when activated by phytochemicals like sulforaphane?",
            "options": ["Directly neutralizing hydroxyl radicals", "Upregulating the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (e.g., SOD, GPx)", "Increasing the production of ATP via Complex V", "Triggering apoptosis in healthy cells"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nrf2 is a transcription factor that binds to the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) in the nucleus, triggering the production of endogenous antioxidants like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Which specific environmental toxin is known to act as a 'mitochondrial uncoupler,' dissipating the proton gradient and causing energy to be lost as heat rather than ATP?",
            "options": ["Glyphosate", "Lead", "2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP)", "Mercury"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DNP is a classic mitochondrial uncoupler that allows protons to leak across the inner membrane, bypassing ATP synthase and generating excessive heat."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "What is the clinical significance of a high 'Lactate-to-Pyruvate' ratio found in a fasting blood test?",
            "options": ["It indicates a state of high aerobic capacity", "It suggests a shift toward anaerobic glycolysis, often due to mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction", "It confirms the patient is in nutritional ketosis", "It indicates excessive protein consumption"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio indicates that the mitochondria are unable to efficiently oxidize pyruvate, forcing the cell to rely on anaerobic glycolysis, a hallmark of mitochondrial distress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical is specifically recognized for its ability to stimulate 'mitophagy' (the clearance of damaged mitochondria) and improve muscle function in clinical trials?",
            "options": ["Resveratrol", "Urolithin A", "Vitamin E", "Magnesium Malate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urolithin A, a metabolite produced by gut bacteria from ellagitannins, has been shown in clinical studies to be a potent inducer of mitophagy, improving mitochondrial health and muscle endurance."
