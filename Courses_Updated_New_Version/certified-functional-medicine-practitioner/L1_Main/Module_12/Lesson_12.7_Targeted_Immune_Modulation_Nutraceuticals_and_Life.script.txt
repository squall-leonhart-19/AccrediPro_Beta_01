Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I’m so glad you’re here with me today. In this lesson, we are stepping into what I consider the most rewarding part of our work together. We are moving into the Target phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™. Up until now, we’ve done the heavy lifting of the Reveal and Organize phases. We’ve looked at the labs. We’ve mapped out the client's history. We’ve identified their specific immune phenotype. Now, we get to apply the precision tools. We get to use clinical-grade nutraceuticals and targeted lifestyle interventions to actually restore immunological tolerance. This is where the magic happens. This is where your clients start to feel like themselves again.

I want to start by framing our mindset for this phase. In the world of functional immunology, we have to be very careful with our language. You’ll often hear people talk about "boosting" the immune system. You see it on supplement bottles in every grocery store. But as a professional, you know that "boosting" is a dangerous misnomer. If a client has an autoimmune condition like Hashimoto’s or Rheumatoid Arthritis, the last thing we want to do is "boost" an already overactive, misdirected immune response. We don't want more fire; we want better fire control. Our goal isn't stimulation. Our goal is balance. We are looking to shift the body from a state of chronic, weary defense into a state of active repair and long-term resilience.

In our time together today, I’m going to walk you through the essential foundations. We’ll start with what I call the Essential Triad. These are the three nutrients that act as the indispensable foundation of any immune protocol. Then, we’re going to talk about a true revolution in clinical practice: Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators, or SPMs. We’ll look at how these differ from standard anti-inflammatories. I’ll also introduce you to some of my favorite botanical modulators—the precision tools that let us "tune" the immune system like a fine instrument. We’ll wrap up by looking at how to personalize these protocols for different phenotypes, whether your client is dealing with autoimmunity, allergies, or chronic viral issues. And of course, we’ll talk about the lifestyle habits, like circadian biology, that make all these supplements work ten times better.

Let’s dive into the Essential Triad. When you look at the thousands of immune-focused supplements on the market, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. But in functional immunology, three nutrients stand above the rest. These aren't just vitamins in the traditional sense. They are actually signaling molecules. They are the messengers that tell the immune system how to interpret its environment. These three are Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and Zinc.

Let’s start with Vitamin D. I often tell my students that Vitamin D is more accurately classified as a pro-hormone than a vitamin. Its influence is staggering. We have Vitamin D receptors, or VDRs, on almost every single immune cell in the human body. That includes T-cells, B-cells, and our antigen-presenting cells. Its primary job in the immune system is to act as the Great Orchestrator. Specifically, Vitamin D is responsible for the induction of T-regulatory cells. I like to call these the "peacekeeper" cells. They are the ones that step in and say, "Okay, everyone calm down," when the immune system is overreacting. Without enough Vitamin D, you simply cannot produce enough of these peacekeepers. This is why we see such a strong link between low Vitamin D levels and the development of autoimmunity.

Now, here is a clinical pearl for you. Never "guess" when it comes to Vitamin D. I see so many practitioners just telling clients to take a "standard" dose of 2,000 units. But a major study in 2022 showed us something critical. While a level of 20 nanograms per milliliter might be enough to prevent rickets, it is nowhere near enough for immune modulation. In cases of autoimmunity, we are often looking for levels between 50 and 80 nanograms per milliliter. This is why the Reveal phase of our method is so important. You have to get that baseline 25-OH Vitamin D level. You have to know where you’re starting so you can target the dose effectively.

Next in our triad is Vitamin A. Specifically, we’re talking about retinoic acid. If Vitamin D is the orchestrator, Vitamin A is the Barrier Specialist. It is absolutely essential for the integrity of our mucosal barriers, especially the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue, or GALT. Vitamin A works in a beautiful synergy with Vitamin D. Together, they promote what we call "oral tolerance." This is the immune system's ability to recognize food and beneficial bacteria as "friends" rather than "foes." When a client is deficient in Vitamin A, their secretory IgA response is compromised. This leaves their gut and respiratory tracts wide open to pathogens and environmental triggers. You can give all the probiotics in the world, but if the Vitamin A levels are low, that mucosal "shield" just won't hold.

The third member of our triad is Zinc. I like to call Zinc the Gatekeeper of Immunity. Most people know Zinc is involved in hundreds of enzymatic reactions, but its most critical role is one that’s often overlooked: it supports the thymus gland. The thymus is where our T-cells go to "school" to learn how to function. As we age, or when we are deficient in Zinc, the thymus can actually start to atrophy or shrink. This reduces the production of "naive" T-cells—the fresh recruits our immune system needs. When Zinc is low, the immune system tends to shift toward a pro-inflammatory state known as Th17. This is the state where tissue destruction happens. So, by ensuring adequate Zinc, we are literally keeping the gates of the immune system functioning properly.

Now, I want to move into one of the most exciting topics in modern functional medicine: the Resolution Revolution. For decades, the standard clinical approach to inflammation has been suppression. If something is inflamed, we give an NSAID like ibuprofen, or we give a steroid like prednisone. We try to "shut down" the inflammation. But here’s the problem: inflammation is actually a natural, healthy response to injury or infection. It’s supposed to happen. The problem isn't that inflammation starts; the problem is that it doesn't stop.

We now know that the "ending" of inflammation isn't just a passive fading away. It’s an active, programmed process called resolution. This process is triggered by specific lipid mediators derived from Omega-3 fatty acids. We call these Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators, or SPMs. Think of them as the "clean-up crew" that comes in after the fire department has put out the fire. Standard anti-inflammatories just stop the fire department from showing up. That sounds good in the short term, but it leaves the "charred remains" and "debris" in the tissues, which leads to chronic, unresolved inflammation.

SPMs, on the other hand, signal the macrophages—our immune system's "garbage eaters"—to come in and clear out the cellular debris. This process is called efferocytosis. By using SPMs instead of just suppressing inflammation, we are helping the body complete its natural cycle. We are moving from defense to tissue regeneration. In my practice, I find SPMs to be a game-changer for clients who feel "constantly inflamed" but aren't getting relief from standard fish oils or Ibuprofen.

Let me tell you about a client of mine named Sarah to show you how this looks in the real world. Sarah was 52 and struggling with Hashimoto’s and severe seasonal allergies. She was exhausted, her brain felt foggy, her joints ached, and every spring she was miserable with hay fever. She felt like her body was constantly under attack. When we looked at her labs, we saw high TPO antibodies, which told us she had an overactive Th1 and Th17 response. But she also had high IgE, which pointed to a Th2 dominance driving her allergies. She was "stuck" in a state of high inflammation across the board.

Instead of just giving her generic "immune support," we targeted her specific needs. We didn't want to "boost" her. We wanted to balance her. We introduced 1,000 milligrams of SPMs daily to help her body finally resolve that lingering joint inflammation. We used 4,000 units of Vitamin D3 combined with K2 to support those T-regulatory "peacekeeper" cells. And to handle her allergies, we used a high dose of Quercetin—about 1,000 milligrams—to stabilize her mast cells.

The results were profound. Within twelve weeks, Sarah told me her joint pain had dropped by about 70%. Her allergy symptoms were the mildest they had been in years. But the most exciting part was her labs. Her TPO antibodies, which had been up at 450, dropped down to 180. We hadn't "cured" her Hashimoto’s, but we had successfully shifted her body toward immunological tolerance. She wasn't at war with herself anymore.

This leads us to our botanical immunomodulators. I love using botanicals because they are sophisticated. They don't just "hit" one pathway; they act like precision tools that "tune" the immune response. Take Curcumin, for example. Curcumin is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB. Think of NF-κB as the "master switch" for inflammation in the body. When this switch is flipped "on," the body pumps out pro-inflammatory cytokines. Curcumin helps flip that switch back to "off." It’s especially effective for calming down that Th17-driven tissue destruction we see in autoimmunity.

Then there’s Quercetin. This is a flavonoid that I consider a "Target" phase staple, especially for anyone with an atopic or allergic phenotype. Quercetin acts as a natural stabilizer for our mast cells. Mast cells are the ones that release histamine and other chemicals that make us feel itchy, puffy, and congested. By stabilizing these cells, Quercetin prevents the "explosion" of histamine before it even starts.

I also have to mention medicinal mushrooms, like Reishi and Turkey Tail. These contain compounds called beta-glucans. These molecules essentially "train" the innate immune system. They help it become more efficient at recognizing real threats like viruses, while at the same time calming down the overreactions we see in allergies. Reishi, in particular, is wonderful because it can enhance the Th1 response—which we need for viral defense—while simultaneously quieting the Th2 response that drives allergies. It’s a true modulator.

As a practitioner, I also want to touch on something practical. The Target phase is often where your practice starts to see real financial growth. When you provide your clients with access to professional-grade, highly bioavailable versions of these nutrients—things they can't just find at a discount drugstore—you are ensuring they get the results they’re paying for. Many of the practitioners I mentor find that by simply managing these high-quality protocols through a professional dispensary, they create a significant stream of recurring revenue. But more importantly, they ensure their clients aren't wasting money on "potency-poor" supplements that don't actually work.

Now, let’s talk about the "orchestra" of the immune system: the Th1 and Th2 dynamics. In the past, we used to think of Th1 and Th2 like a simple seesaw. If one was up, the other was down. We now know it’s much more complex than that. It’s more like a four-way intersection. You have Th1 and Th2, but you also have Th17, which is the "destructive" wing, and the T-regulatory cells, which are the "traffic police."

To restore balance, we have to support those T-regulatory cells. Beyond Vitamin D, there are a few other key players here. One of my favorites is Short-Chain Fatty Acids, specifically Butyrate. Butyrate is produced by our gut bacteria when they ferment fiber. It’s not just "gut fuel"; it’s actually a primary signal that tells the body to produce more T-regulatory cells. This is why gut health and immune health are inseparable.

We also have to think about Glutathione. This is our "master antioxidant." It maintains the "redox" environment that T-cells need to function correctly. If the body is under too much oxidative stress, the T-cells can’t do their jobs, and the "traffic police" disappear.

And we cannot forget about circadian biology. This is a huge part of the Target phase. Melatonin is often thought of as just a sleep hormone, but it is actually a powerful immunomodulator. It helps prevent what we call "nocturnal cytokine storms." If a client is staying up late, staring at blue light, and cutting their sleep short, no amount of Vitamin D is going to fix their immune system. I always tell my clients that the window between 10 PM and 2 AM is the "golden window" for immune repair. We have to target the lifestyle just as much as we target the supplement protocol.

So, how do we put this all together into personalized phenotyping? We never use a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Instead, we match our intervention to the phenotype we identified in the Reveal phase.

If a client is Autoimmune Dominant, our primary goal is to quell that Th17 response and induce those T-regulatory cells. We’re going to reach for Vitamin D, Curcumin, Butyrate, and SPMs. We want to stop the tissue destruction and bring in the peacekeepers.

If a client is Atopic or Allergic, we are looking to calm the Th2 response and stabilize those mast cells. This is where Quercetin, Vitamin C, and Reishi mushroom really shine. We’re trying to tell the immune system that pollen and dander are not life-threatening emergencies.

For those with Chronic Viral issues, we want to enhance the Th1 response and support our Natural Killer cells. We’ll look at Zinc, Vitamin A, and botanicals like Astragalus or Turkey Tail mushroom. We’re giving the "soldiers" the tools they need to finish the job.

And for those with Systemic Inflammation—maybe they don't have a specific diagnosis yet, but they just feel "inflamed" all over—our focus is on resolving that active inflammation. This is where the "Resolution Revolution" of SPMs and high-dose Omega-3s is most powerful, often combined with things like Boswellia.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to keep in mind as you work with your clients. First, always remember that immune modulation is about balance and tolerance, not "boosting." We are looking for harmony, not volume. Second, never underestimate the power of the Essential Triad—Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and Zinc. They are the non-negotiable foundations of any successful protocol. Third, embrace the paradigm shift of SPMs. Moving from "suppression" to "resolution" is one of the most important things you can do for a client with chronic issues. Fourth, always match your intervention to the client's specific phenotype. Precision is what sets a professional apart from a hobbyist. And finally, never forget the power of lifestyle. Circadian rhythm and sleep are just as "medicinal" as any supplement we’ve discussed.

You’re doing incredible work. By mastering these Target phase interventions, you are giving your clients a path back to health that is grounded in science and deep physiological respect. You aren't just giving them pills; you’re giving them their lives back.

Great work today. Spend some time reviewing the clinical applications we talked about, and I’ll see you in the next lesson.
