Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you’ve joined me for this lesson. We are diving into a topic that is often misunderstood, but when you get it right, it becomes one of the most powerful levers you have as a functional medicine practitioner. We’re talking about movement. But I want to be clear from the very beginning: we are not just talking about going to the gym or hitting a personal best on a treadmill. We are talking about movement as a form of biological communication.

In our last lesson, we spent a lot of time looking inward. We explored how the nervous system dictates our internal capacity for healing. We talked about safety, the vagus nerve, and how the body decides whether to invest in repair or stay in a state of defense. Today, we are going to translate that internal stability into external action. You see, functional movement isn't just about burning off a meal or fitting into a certain pair of jeans. In this paradigm, movement is the primary way we signal to our genes that we are alive, that we are capable, and that we are worthy of receiving metabolic resources.

For many of the clients who will walk into your office, the word exercise carries a lot of heavy baggage. They might feel shame about their weight, or they might be utterly exhausted by the thought of a workout. Maybe they have a history of failed gym memberships or intense classes that left them feeling broken. In functional medicine, we have the opportunity to change that narrative completely. We shift the paradigm from exercise as a form of punishment to movement as a form of information.

By the end of our time together today, you’re going to be able to do a few very specific things. First, you’ll be able to clearly differentiate between exercise and movement within a clinical framework. You’ll understand why Zone 2 training is the secret sauce for mitochondrial health and metabolic flexibility. We’re going to look at the skeletal muscle not just as a pulley system for your bones, but as a massive endocrine organ that talks to every other system in the body. We’ll also talk about how to maximize something called NEAT, which is the movement that happens outside of the gym. And perhaps most importantly, I’m going to teach you how to modify these protocols for your most fragile patients—those struggling with chronic fatigue or HPA axis dysfunction who simply cannot handle a traditional workout.

Before we get into the deep science, I want to tell you a story about a client named Linda. Linda was fifty-two years old and had spent most of her career as an administrative assistant. She was actually in the process of transitioning into wellness coaching herself, so she knew a bit about health, but she was stuck. She came to me with about twenty-five pounds of stubborn weight gain that had crept on over the last three years. She was struggling with significant brain fog and these daily afternoon energy crashes that made it impossible for her to focus on her studies. Her labs showed an HbA1c of 5.8 percent, which put her right in that pre-diabetic range.

Linda’s biggest barrier was her own belief system. She was convinced that she needed intense, heart-pounding cardio to lose the weight. She kept trying to join these high-intensity interval training classes, but every time she went, she ended up bedridden with fatigue for two days afterward. She was stuck in a cycle of pushing too hard and then crashing.

We completely changed her approach. We shifted Linda from exercise to movement. We stopped the HIIT classes immediately. Instead, we implemented a simple ten-minute walk after her largest meals to help with glucose clearing. We prioritized what we call Zone 2 walking three times a week—just a steady, conversational pace. We also looked at her daily life. Since she was studying and working from home, she was sitting for hours. We got her a standing desk and encouraged her to use it for just two hours a day.

The results were incredible. Within four months, Linda’s HbA1c dropped from 5.8 down to 5.3 percent. She lost fourteen pounds without ever doing a single high-intensity workout. More importantly, her brain fog cleared up. She felt energized enough to finish her certification and actually started charging two hundred and fifty dollars per session for her own metabolic coaching. She learned that she didn't need to beat her body into submission; she just needed to give it the right signals.

So, let’s talk about that first big distinction: Exercise versus Movement. In the conventional fitness world, we often view health through the lens of what I call the Gym Hour. You know the profile. A client sits at a desk for eight hours, commutes in a car for another hour, sits on the couch for three hours in the evening, but they spend sixty minutes on a treadmill and think they’ve checked the box for health. In functional medicine, we call this the Active Sedentary profile.

Here is the hard truth that research is now showing us: sixty minutes of exercise cannot fully undo the metabolic damage caused by twelve hours of sitting. Sedentary physiology is its own distinct biological state. It’s not just the absence of exercise; it’s a state characterized by the suppression of an enzyme called Lipoprotein Lipase, or LPL. This enzyme is critical because it’s what captures fat from your bloodstream to be used as fuel by your muscles. When we sit for prolonged periods, LPL activity in our skeletal muscles can drop by as much as ninety percent. This means even if you’re eating perfectly, your body is struggling to actually use that fat for energy because the machinery is turned off.

I want you to teach your clients that movement is the baseline requirement for being a human being. Exercise, on the other hand, is a specific stimulus we use to force the body to adapt and get stronger. We have to fix the baseline movement before we ever think about adding the stress of intense exercise. If the baseline is broken, the exercise just becomes another source of inflammation.

This leads us to a concept called NEAT, which stands for Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis. This is essentially all the energy you expend doing everything that isn't sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise. It’s walking to your car, it’s typing on your laptop, it’s doing the dishes, it’s yard work, and even just fidgeting in your chair.

A study from 2022 showed something fascinating. They found that the difference in NEAT between two people of the same size can be as much as two thousand calories per day. Think about that for a second. That is the difference between a small meal and a massive feast, all determined by how much someone moves throughout their day in ways they don't even consider exercise. When you have a client who says they can’t lose weight even though they’re barely eating, the missing link is almost always a low NEAT score. In our R.O.O.T.S. Method, we address this during the Optimize phase. We want to restore that basal metabolic rate without triggering a massive cortisol spike that would come from a heavy workout.

When we move, we change our internal chemistry. In a sedentary state, our LPL enzyme is suppressed, our glucose disposal is slow and relies heavily on insulin, and our mitochondria are essentially in a state of decay. But the moment we start moving, we flip a switch. Contraction-mediated glucose disposal kicks in, meaning our muscles can take up sugar from the blood even without needing a bunch of insulin. We start sending signals for mitochondrial repair. Most importantly, we shift from producing pro-inflammatory cytokines to producing anti-inflammatory myokines.

This brings us to one of my favorite topics: muscle as an endocrine organ. We really have to stop looking at muscle as just something that helps us move our bones. It is actually the largest endocrine organ in the human body. When your muscles contract, they aren't just doing mechanical work; they are secreting signaling molecules called myokines. You might have heard of some of these, like Interleukin-6, Irisin, or BDNF, which stands for Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.

These myokines are like chemical messengers that travel through your entire bloodstream. They talk to your brain to improve your mood and cognitive function. They talk to your liver to improve how you produce and manage glucose. They even talk to your fat cells to promote fat oxidation. This is why sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass, is now recognized as a primary driver of metabolic syndrome and cognitive decline, especially in women over the age of forty-five.

As a functional practitioner, this gives you a huge advantage. If you offer something like body composition analysis instead of just tracking weight on a scale, you can charge premium rates. Why? Because you aren't just helping someone lose weight; you are helping them build metabolic insurance. You’re helping them build the organ of longevity. Clients are willing to pay much more for a practitioner who understands that muscle is the key to hormonal balance and a sharp mind.

Now, let’s talk about the specific type of movement that I consider the gold standard in functional medicine: Zone 2 training. In the Optimize node of our clinical matrix, this is what we prioritize. Zone 2 is defined as the highest intensity of exercise where you can still maintain a full conversation. We call it the talk test. If you’re huffing and puffing and can’t finish a sentence, you’ve gone past Zone 2.

Biologically, this is the sweet spot. This is where you are maximizing fat oxidation and mitochondrial recruitment. Zone 2 training does three incredible things. First, it stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis—the creation of brand-new mitochondria. It also makes your existing mitochondria more efficient. Second, it improves lactate clearance. It teaches your body how to clear out the metabolic byproducts of exercise so you don't get that heavy, acidic feeling of fatigue. And third, it builds metabolic flexibility. It teaches your body how to switch from being a sugar burner to a fat burner.

For many of your clients, especially those who are already stressed, Zone 2 is the most intense exercise they should be doing. It provides all the metabolic benefits without the massive recovery debt that comes from high-intensity training.

However, we have to be very careful with what I call the fragile patient. These are the clients coming to you with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, or significant HPA axis dysregulation. In conventional fitness, the answer is almost always to push harder. But for these clients, exercise is a stressor that their body simply cannot resolve. If their internal bucket is already full of stress, adding a hard workout is just going to make the bucket overflow.

One of the most important things you can look for is something called Post-Exertional Malaise, or PEM. This is when a client feels significantly worse twenty-four to forty-eight hours after they move. If they go for a walk and then need to nap for three hours, or if they’re bedridden the next day, they have exceeded their metabolic capacity.

For these fragile patients, movement must be restorative, not transformative. We use what I call the Goldilocks approach. We might start with just ten minutes of walking in nature to support vagal tone. We might use restorative yoga that focuses on breath and mobility rather than strength. Or we might use isometric holds—where you hold a position without moving—to build muscle tension without the systemic stress that comes from lifting heavy weights.

I always tell my practitioners to ask their clients one simple question: How do you feel twenty-four hours after your movement? If the answer is exhausted, you have to scale back. We have to optimize the mitochondria and the nervous system before we can ever target high-intensity performance.

Let’s take a moment to check our understanding of what we’ve covered so far. Think about why sixty minutes of exercise often isn't enough to counteract ten hours of sitting. Remember what we said about the LPL enzyme? It’s because sitting creates a distinct biological state of suppression that a single hour of movement can’t always overcome.

What about the significance of myokines? Remember, these are the signaling molecules produced by contracting muscles that talk to the brain, liver, and fat cells. They are the reason muscle is considered an endocrine organ.

When we talk about mitochondrial health and fat oxidation, which heart rate zone are we aiming for? That’s right, Zone 2—the conversational pace. And finally, if a client is experiencing Post-Exertional Malaise, how should you adjust? You have to scale back. Movement must be restorative and stay within their current metabolic capacity.

As we wrap up this lesson, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to keep in your back pocket. First, remember that movement is information. Every step your client takes is telling their body to stay metabolically active. On the flip side, every hour they spend sitting is a signal of stagnation.

Second, NEAT is your foundation. For many clients, simply increasing their non-exercise activity throughout the day is going to be more effective for their metabolic health than adding a gym membership they might not even use.

Third, muscle equals longevity. Preserving and building lean mass isn't about vanity; it’s about hormonal balance, inflammatory control, and protecting the brain as your clients age.

Fourth, use Zone 2 for energy. It is the most efficient way to heal the mitochondria and improve metabolic flexibility without burning your clients out.

And finally, always respect the capacity of the person in front of you. Match your movement prescription to their current HPA axis and mitochondrial status. If they are fragile, treat them with care.

You are doing such important work. By changing how your clients move, you are literally changing the signals their genes receive every single day. You’re helping them move away from a state of defense and into a state of growth and repair.

Great work today. I look forward to seeing you in the next lesson where we’ll continue building out your functional medicine toolkit. Keep practicing these concepts, and I’ll talk to you soon.
