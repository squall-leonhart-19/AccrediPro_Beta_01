            "question": "According to the 'Optimization Hierarchy' discussed in Lesson 1, why must systemic stability be established before implementing specific, high-potency interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Specific interventions are too expensive for most patients to start with.",
                "High-potency interventions can overwhelm a dysregulated system, leading to 'healing crises' or paradoxical reactions.",
                "Stability is only required for geriatric patients, not for high-performing athletes.",
                "Specific interventions only work if the patient has achieved a BMI under 25."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes 'Stability Before Specificity.' If the foundational physiological systems (blood sugar, circadian rhythm, hydration) are unstable, targeted interventions like heavy metal chelation or high-dose hormone therapy can cause adverse reactions because the body lacks the resilience to process them."

            "question": "In the context of 'Food as Information,' how do bioactive compounds like sulforaphane primarily influence cellular health?",
            "options": [
                "By providing direct caloric energy to the mitochondria.",
                "By acting as a structural component of the cell membrane.",
                "By triggering the Nrf2 pathway, which upregulates the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes.",
                "By neutralizing stomach acid to improve nutrient absorption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 explains that food acts as signaling molecules. Sulforaphane isn't just a nutrient; it is information that signals the Nrf2 pathway to increase the production of protective enzymes like glutathione S-transferase."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A patient presents with chronic fatigue and 'brain fog' despite drinking 3 liters of distilled water daily. Based on Lesson 3, what is the most likely physiological explanation?",
            "options": [
                "The patient is experiencing 'dilutional hyponatremia' or lack of electrolyte-guided cellular hydration.",
                "The patient is drinking too much water, which is drowning the mitochondria.",
                "Distilled water contains too much deuterium, slowing down ATP production.",
                "Brain fog is unrelated to hydration and is strictly a carbohydrate metabolism issue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 highlights that hydration is not just about water volume but about osmotic balance. Distilled water lacks minerals; without adequate electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium), water cannot effectively enter the intracellular space, potentially leading to extracellular dilution and poor cellular function."

            "question": "Which biological mechanism explains why exposure to blue light (460-480nm) after 9:00 PM disrupts sleep architecture?",
            "options": [
                "It increases adenosine levels too rapidly, causing 'sleep pressure' to peak early.",
                "It suppresses the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland via the retinohypothalamic tract.",
                "It lowers the core body temperature, preventing the onset of REM sleep.",
                "It stimulates the production of ghrelin, making the patient too hungry to sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 discusses Circadian Biology. Blue light signals the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) that it is daytime, which inhibits the pineal gland's production of melatonin, the hormone necessary for sleep onset and quality sleep architecture."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "What does a high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) typically indicate regarding a patient's autonomic nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "A state of chronic sympathetic dominance and high cortisol.",
                "An irregular heart rhythm that requires immediate referral to a cardiologist.",
                "Strong vagal tone and the ability of the nervous system to switch flexibly between stress and recovery states.",
                "That the patient is overtraining and needs at least 48 hours of complete rest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As covered in Lesson 5, HRV is a proxy for vagal tone. High variability between heartbeats indicates that the parasympathetic nervous system (vagus nerve) is actively modulating the heart rate, reflecting better resilience and stress modulation."

            "question": "The 'Active Sedentary' phenomenon refers to individuals who:",
            "options": [
                "Exercise for 60 minutes a day but remain seated for the remaining 10-12 hours.",
                "Perform high-intensity interval training (HIIT) more than five times per week.",
                "Walk 10,000 steps a day but do not perform any resistance training.",
                "Have a high metabolic rate despite a lack of purposeful exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 explains that even 60 minutes of exercise cannot fully counteract the metabolic 'shut down' (e.g., decreased lipoprotein lipase activity) that occurs during 10+ hours of continuous sitting. This is known as the active sedentary phenotype."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "When addressing 'Total Load' in environmental detoxification (Lesson 7), what is the first priority in the functional medicine hierarchy?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing a 10-day water fast to clear systemic toxins.",
                "Starting a high-dose intravenous (IV) glutathione protocol.",
                "Identification and removal of ongoing exogenous exposures (Source Control).",
                "Testing the patient's genetic SNPs for Phase II detoxification pathways."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Lesson 7, 'Source Control' is the first and most critical step. You cannot effectively detoxify a patient who is still being actively exposed to the toxin (e.g., mold in the home or BPA in their daily water bottle)."

            "question": "In Motivational Interviewing (Lesson 8), what is the 'Righting Reflex' and why should a practitioner avoid it?",
            "options": [
                "The urge to correct a patient’s posture; it distracts from the emotional conversation.",
                "The impulse to fix a patient's problems with immediate advice; it often triggers 'change talk' resistance.",
                "The ability to correctly diagnose a condition; it should be used as often as possible.",
                "A neurological reflex in the inner ear that maintains balance during exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 describes the 'Righting Reflex' as the practitioner’s natural desire to tell the patient what to do. This often backfires because it causes the patient to defend their current behavior, decreasing the likelihood of sustainable change."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "According to research cited in Lesson 6, how many minutes of light activity (like walking) are required to 'reset' the metabolic inhibition caused by 60 minutes of sitting?",
            "options": [
                "At least 20 minutes.",
                "Exactly 1 minute.",
                "Approximately 2-5 minutes.",
                "Light activity does not reset metabolic inhibition; only vigorous exercise works."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 cites data showing that breaking up sedentary time with just 2-5 minutes of light movement every hour significantly improves postprandial glucose and insulin levels compared to continuous sitting."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Phase 0' of detoxification mentioned in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "The conjugation of toxins with amino acids in the liver.",
                "The transport of toxins into the cell for processing.",
                "The initial oxidation of a toxin by Cytochrome P450 enzymes.",
                "The elimination of toxins through the sebum and sweat glands."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 details the phases of detox. Phase 0 is the 'uptake' phase where toxins are transported from the blood into the hepatocytes (liver cells) or other cells for processing. If Phase 0 is sluggish, toxins remain in systemic circulation."
