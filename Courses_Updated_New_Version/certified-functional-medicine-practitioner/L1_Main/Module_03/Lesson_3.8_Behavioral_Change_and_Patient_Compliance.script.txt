Hi, it's Sarah. In this lesson, we are diving into one of my favorite parts of the functional medicine journey. We’ve already moved through the Reveal phase, where we acted as detectives to find those hidden triggers. We’ve navigated the Remove phase, where we cleared out the noise and the inflammatory inputs that were holding the body back. Now, we finally enter the Optimize phase. This is where the real magic happens. This is where we fine-tune the body’s machinery for peak performance.

Before we get into the technical details, I want to share a bit of my own journey. I remember transitioning from my career as a nurse into functional medicine coaching. Back then, I used to think my job was just to fix what was broken. I was trained in a system that looked for disease. If there was no disease, the job was done. But in this Optimize phase, we do something much more exciting. We help clients move from being simply not sick to truly thriving. Today, you are going to practice how to explain this shift to a client who feels stuck in the middle. You know the type. They’ve done the work, they feel better, but they aren’t quite great yet.

By the end of this lab, you’ll be able to articulate the difference between normal lab ranges and optimal functional ranges. You’ll learn how to pivot a conversation from symptom management to performance optimization. You’ll be able to explain complex ideas like mitochondrial support using simple narratives. You’ll practice a high-value coaching script. And importantly, you’ll learn how to identify the four common mistakes coaches make when they start fine-tuning a client's protocol.

Let’s start with a scenario. Imagine you are working with a client named Elena. Elena is 52 years old. She’s a former elementary school teacher, married, and currently navigating the perimenopausal transition. She’s been working with you for about twelve weeks now. She’s been a star student. She removed gluten and dairy during your Remove phase. She identified that her stress levels were through the roof during the Reveal phase. The results have been good. Her bloating is gone. Her sleep has improved from five hours a night to seven hours. 

But here is the challenge. Elena comes to your session and says, Sarah, I feel better, but I am still not me. I still have this afternoon brain fog. I don’t have the energy to exercise like I used to. My doctor says my labs are normal, so maybe this is just what 52 is supposed to feel like? 

Take a breath and think about that. How many times have we heard a client say that? It’s a pivotal moment in the coaching relationship. If you agree with her, the journey ends at better. But if you guide her into optimization, the journey leads to vitality.

Before you speak with Elena, we need to review how our approach differs from the conventional normal check-up. Elena needs to understand why we are looking closer than her primary care physician did. In the conventional world, lab interpretation is based on pathology. These are broad ranges designed to catch disease. If you are within that range, you are considered healthy. But in functional medicine, we use performance-based ranges. We call these functional ranges. They are much tighter and more specific.

Think about Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, or TSH. A conventional lab range might be anywhere from 0.5 to 4.5. That is a massive window. If Elena is at a 4.2, her doctor tells her she is normal. But we know that for most women to feel vibrant and clear-headed, that number needs to be between 1.0 and 2.0. When she’s at a 4.2, she isn't diseased, but she is definitely not optimized. She’s dragging.

Or look at Ferritin, which is our storage iron. A standard lab range can be as wide as 15 to 150. If Elena is at a 20, her doctor says she’s fine. But research shows that for optimal energy and hair growth, most women need that Ferritin level to be between 70 and 100. At a 20, she’s running on an empty tank, even if the red light on her dashboard hasn't turned on yet.

The goal of conventional medicine is the absence of diagnosable disease. Our goal in the Optimize phase is maximum cellular vitality and longevity. When a client tells you their doctor said they are normal, I want you to resist the urge to bash the doctor. The doctor is doing their job of looking for disease. Instead, use the high-performance car analogy. Tell them, Elena, a car can be normal. It starts, it drives, and it gets you from point A to point B. But that doesn't mean it’s optimized. An optimized car has clean filters, it uses high-octane fuel, and the engine is perfectly tuned. You aren't just looking for a car that runs; you want a car that performs. You are the tuner, not just the mechanic.

Here’s a coach tip for you. In this phase, I want you to focus heavily on what I call the spark plugs of the cell. These are things like CoQ10, Magnesium, and B-vitamins. These are essential for the mitochondria. When a client like Elena has removed the inflammatory foods but still isn't thriving, it is often a nutrient density or an absorption issue. We need to make sure her cellular power plants have the fuel they need to produce energy.

Now, let’s talk about how to actually say this to Elena. You want to build her confidence that there is another level of health available to her. You might say something like this: Elena, I hear you. It’s frustrating to feel like you’ve done so much work and yet you’re still hitting this ceiling. I’m so glad your doctor ruled out any major disease. That’s actually great news because it means we have a solid foundation to build on. What your doctor is looking at are the pathological ranges—the markers for sickness. What I’m looking at are the functional ranges—the markers for thriving. Right now, your body is in the normal zone, but we want to move you into the optimal zone. We’ve removed the things that were draining your battery. Now, we are going to focus on recharging it.

I want you to practice that. Don’t just listen to me say it. I want you to speak it out loud. Your brain needs to hear your own voice saying these professional, confident terms. One of the best things you can do is record yourself on your phone. Explain the difference between that Ferritin level of 22 versus 80. Listen back to it. Do you sound like a peer just chatting, or do you sound like a professional? You are aiming for a tone I call Warm Authority. You are empathetic, but you are the expert in the room.

Practice that mitochondria power plant analogy until it feels like second nature. You could tell Elena: Imagine every cell in your body has a tiny power plant inside it. These are your mitochondria. Their job is to take the food you eat and the oxygen you breathe and turn them into energy. Over the last twelve weeks, we’ve cleared the smoke and the soot out of those power plants by changing your diet. But now, we need to make sure the machinery inside is actually working at full capacity. We’re going to give those power plants the specific nutrients they need to spark that energy back to life.

I really want to emphasize the value of what you are doing here. Practitioners like you—many of you coming from backgrounds in teaching or nursing—often find that this is where you can charge a premium. In my own practice, I’ve seen coaches charge 350 to 500 dollars for a single ninety-minute Optimization Deep Dive. This is where you move beyond basic diet and into advanced, bio-individual fine-tuning. This is where your highest value lies because this is the level of care that most people simply cannot get in the standard medical system.

However, even the most experienced coaches can stumble in this phase. I want to walk you through four common pitfalls so you can avoid them. 

The first one is what I call the Supplement Shotgun. This is when a coach gets excited and adds ten new supplements all at once. I know it’s tempting. You want the client to feel better fast. But if you change ten things at once and the client feels worse, you don’t know which one caused it. Or if they feel better, you don’t know which one actually worked. You want to optimize one system at a time. Be methodical.

The second mistake is ignoring the Reveal data. Sometimes we get so focused on the physical optimization that we forget that stress and high cortisol can un-optimize even the most perfect diet. If Elena is still under massive stress, all the CoQ10 in the world won’t fix her brain fog. You have to keep that holistic view.

The third mistake is settling for better. It’s very common for a client to want to stop the program because they feel fifty percent better. They think, well, my bloating is gone and I’m sleeping more, so I guess this is as good as it gets. As a coach, your job is to hold the vision for them. Don’t let them settle for fifty percent when a hundred percent is possible. Remind them that they deserve to feel fully optimized, not just less sick.

The fourth mistake is over-complicating. It’s easy to get caught up in the science and start using too much science-speak. If you start talking about the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, you might lose Elena. You want to empower her, not confuse her. Use the analogies. Keep it grounded in how she feels and what she can do in her daily life.

If Elena starts to feel discouraged during this phase, remind her of how far she’s come. Tell her: Elena, the Reveal and Remove phases were the hard work. That was the heavy lifting. This Optimize phase? This is the reward. This is where we get to be detectives and find your unique thrive settings. We are just fine-tuning the dial now.

Let's do a quick check of what we've covered. Think about why this Optimize phase is so valuable. It's because it bridges the gap between the absence of disease and the presence of vitality. Remember the difference between those lab ranges. A pathological range is looking for a fire in the house. A functional range is looking to see if the house is comfortable and well-lit. 

When a client asks why they need to optimize if they are already eating healthy, you have your answer ready. Eating healthy is the baseline. It’s what keeps the engine from breaking down. Optimization is what makes the engine purr. It's about nutrient density and cellular efficiency. And of course, you have your analogies ready—the high-performance car and the cellular power plant.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to keep in your back pocket. First, always remember that the Optimize phase is about moving from disease-free to high-vitality. Second, use those functional lab ranges to show your clients where those hidden opportunities for improvement are hiding. When they see the numbers, it makes it real for them. Third, keep the story of mitochondrial health at the center of your energy conversations. It’s a concept people can visualize and understand. Fourth, always maintain that Warm Authority. Validate how much progress they’ve made, but don’t be afraid to show them that there is a higher peak to climb. And finally, avoid that Supplement Shotgun. Fine-tune the body’s systems methodically for the best, most sustainable results.

I want you to think about the clients you have right now. Is there someone who has reached a plateau? Someone who is better but not great? That is your candidate for optimization. That is where you get to step in and show them what is truly possible for their health.

This work is so important. We are changing the narrative of what it means to age and what it means to live in a human body. We aren't just managing symptoms; we are unlocking potential. 

Great work today. I am so proud of the dedication you are showing to your craft. Take some time to practice those scripts, record yourself, and really get comfortable with these concepts. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
