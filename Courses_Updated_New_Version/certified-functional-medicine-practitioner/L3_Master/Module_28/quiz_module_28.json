            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered a primary 'danger signal' (DAMP) and serves as an independent predictor of severity in acute inflammatory storms?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Ferritin >1000 ng/mL",
                "LDL Cholesterol <70 mg/dL",
                "Hemoglobin A1c >5.7%",
                "Alkaline Phosphatase <50 U/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ferritin is not just a storage protein; in a crisis, it acts as a Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), triggering further cytokine release. Levels exceeding 1000 ng/mL are often indicative of a hyperinflammatory state."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the management of Neuro-Excitotoxicity, what is the primary mechanism by which Magnesium acts as a 'neuronal stabilizer'?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the release of Glutamate into the synapse",
                "It acts as a physiological voltage-gated block on the NMDA receptor",
                "It increases the permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier",
                "It inhibits the production of GABA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium sits in the pore of the NMDA receptor, preventing excessive calcium influx. When magnesium is depleted, the receptor becomes hypersensitive to glutamate, leading to excitotoxicity."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A client with suspected MCAS experiences an acute flare. Which clinical finding is the gold standard for confirming a mast cell 'event' compared to their baseline?",

                "Decreased levels of Eosinophil Cationic Protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because 'normal' tryptase ranges are broad, the consensus criteria for an MCAS event requires a rise of at least 20% plus 2 ng/mL from the individual's own baseline tryptase level."

            "id": "q28_4",

                "Hypomagnesemia and Hyperglycemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aldosterone deficiency leads to the wasting of sodium (hyponatremia) and the retention of potassium (hyperkalemia), which can lead to cardiovascular instability in a crisis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "What is the primary driver of a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction during the treatment of multi-infection syndromes?",

                "An allergic reaction to the botanical antimicrobial being used"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Herxheimer reaction is an endotoxic response to the debris (LPS) released when large numbers of bacteria or spirochetes are killed rapidly, overwhelming the body's clearance capacity."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In 'Acute Detoxification Failure,' which Phase II conjugation pathway is most rapidly depleted during an acute toxic insult or oxidative stress?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glutathione is the body's master antioxidant and primary Phase II conjugator for many toxins. Under acute stress, glutathione stores can be depleted in hours, leading to hepatotoxicity."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A patient taking the anticoagulant Warfarin starts high-dose Quercetin for MCAS stabilization. Why is this a 'Poly-Pharmacy' risk?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Quercetin is a known inhibitor of CYP2C9, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing Warfarin. Inhibiting this enzyme can lead to dangerously high levels of the drug in the system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a crisis, the practitioner must first 'put out the fire' by stabilizing membranes (using phospholipids) and reducing acute inflammation before moving to deeper systemic protocols."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alkalizing salts help buffer the metabolic acidosis often associated with acute die-off reactions, facilitating the transport and excretion of toxins through the kidneys."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Threshold Effect' in environmental toxicity as described in Lesson 6?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The threshold effect explains why a patient may appear 'fine' for years until one final 'drop' (a new toxin, stressor, or infection) causes the bucket to overflow, resulting in a complex crisis."
