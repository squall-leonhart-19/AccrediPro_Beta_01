            "question": "In Advanced Clinical Reasoning (L1), 'Premature Closure' is identified as one of the most common cognitive biases. How is this best defined in a Master Practitioner context?",
            "options": [
                "Failing to consider a diagnosis because it is rare in the general population.",
                "The tendency to stop the diagnostic process once a potential 'root cause' is identified, ignoring confounding variables.",
                "Over-relying on the first piece of information offered by the patient during the intake.",
                "Selecting a treatment plan based solely on the most recent successful case in the practitioner's office."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Premature closure is the tendency to stop the search for causes once a 'good enough' explanation is found, which often leads master practitioners to miss the multi-layered nature of complex chronic illness."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "During a Master-Level 'Reveal' intake (L2), a practitioner identifies a 'Secondary Gain.' What does this term refer to in the context of chronic illness?",
            "options": [
                "The metabolic benefit of a specific nutraceutical intervention.",
                "The financial compensation a patient receives from disability insurance.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the hidden benefits of illness that can create unconscious resistance to recovery, requiring master-level behavioral architecture to resolve."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "In Precision Nutraceutical Engineering (L3), what is the primary physiological rationale for 'Pulse Dosing' (intermittent administration) of potent herbal antimicrobials?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the peak plasma concentration of the active compounds.",
                "To prevent receptor downregulation and microbial adaptation/resistance while allowing the host's detoxification systems to clear debris.",
                "To reduce the overall cost of the protocol for the patient.",
                "To ensure the patient remains compliant by giving them 'days off' from their regimen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pulse dosing is used in complex cases to prevent the body from becoming desensitized to the intervention and to manage the 'kill-off' rate, preventing emunctory overload."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "When Mastering the 'Order of Operations' (L4) for a complex patient with SIBO, Mold Illness, and HPA Axis dysfunction, what is the 'Master Level' priority before initiating aggressive binders or antimicrobials?",

                "Starting a ketogenic diet to starve the gut bacteria.",
                "Ordering a full genomic sequence to identify MTHFR status."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, the 'Order of Operations' dictates that drainage pathways must be open and functional before mobilizing toxins or killing pathogens to avoid severe Herxheimer reactions."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "According to the Behavioral Change Architecture (L5), what is 'Affective Decay' and how should a practitioner mitigate it?",

                "The loss of muscle mass due to chronic stress.",
                "The rapid decline in a patient's emotional motivation and 'readiness to change' shortly after leaving the clinical encounter.",
                "The degradation of the practitioner's empathy after seeing too many patients (burnout)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Affective decay describes how the 'high' of a session fades quickly. Master practitioners mitigate this by using 'Immediate Action Steps' and automated follow-ups within 24-48 hours."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "In Advanced Laboratory Interpretation (L6), the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is used as a 'Functional Shift' marker. What NLR range is generally considered indicative of occult systemic inflammation even if WBCs are 'normal'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' ranges are broad, a functional shift in the NLR above 2.2-2.5 often indicates a pro-inflammatory state and increased cardiovascular or metabolic risk."

                "Advise the patient to stop their conventional treatment in favor of the functional approach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical leadership involves collaborative care and providing evidence-based rationales to the broader medical team to ensure patient safety and integrated success."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "In 'The Practitioner’s Presence' (L8), what does the research on 'Thin-Slicing' suggest about clinical intuition?",

                "Intuition is always wrong and should be ignored in favor of algorithms.",
                "Expert practitioners can often make accurate assessments within the first few minutes of an encounter by recognizing complex patterns subconsciously.",
                "Practitioners should only use intuition after seeing a patient for at least six months.",
                "Intuition is only valid if the practitioner has a PhD in psychology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thin-slicing is the ability of experts to use 'pattern recognition' to find patterns in events based only on 'thin slices,' or narrow windows, of experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emergence is a key principle of Systems Biology where the interaction of various dysfunctions (gut, immune, toxin) creates a unique clinical picture that cannot be understood by looking at the organs in isolation."
