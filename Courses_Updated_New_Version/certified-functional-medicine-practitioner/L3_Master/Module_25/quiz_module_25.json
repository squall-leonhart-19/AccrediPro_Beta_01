            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical supervision in a functional medicine context must balance the immediate safety and outcomes of the patient with the long-term professional growth and critical thinking skills of the mentee."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Novice practitioners often rush to 'label' a condition (Diagnosis) before they have fully mapped the Antecedents, Triggers, and Mediators (ATMs) within the Functional Medicine Matrix."

        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Optimize' and 'Target' supervision guidelines (L3), what should a supervisor do if a mentee proposes a $500/month supplement protocol for a patient who is only sleeping 5 hours a night?",
            "options": [
                "Approve the protocol but suggest adding a melatonin supplement",
                "Redirect the mentee to address 'Foundational Triage' (sleep) before 'Targeted Intervention'",
                "Advise the mentee to run more labs to justify the expensive protocol",
                "Allow the mentee to proceed to see if the supplements improve sleep quality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Optimize' phase dictates that foundational lifestyle factors (Sleep, Nutrition, Movement) must be stabilized before 'Targeted' high-cost interventions are applied, as foundations often resolve the need for complex protocols."

                "Exactly at the 12-month mark",

                "After the first follow-up appointment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 4-to-6-month window is critical; patients often experience a plateau or 'compliance fatigue,' requiring the practitioner to pivot from 'fixing' to 'mentoring' long-term lifestyle integration."

                "A genetic SNP that explains the entirety of the patient's pathology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counter-transference is a boundary issue where the supervisor's own emotional history or biases interfere with their objective guidance of the mentee."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Legacy mentorship is about developing the mentee's internal 'clinical compass' through Socratic questioning rather than creating a 'mini-me' who simply copies protocols."

            "id": "q25_9",
