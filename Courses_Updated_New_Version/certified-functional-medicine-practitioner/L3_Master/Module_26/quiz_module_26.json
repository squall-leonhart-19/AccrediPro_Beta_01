            "question": "In the 'Clinical Architecture' of a multi-phased functional medicine protocol, what is the primary objective of the 'Preparation/Priming' phase before initiating an antimicrobial or heavy metal detox protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To aggressively kill off pathogenic overgrowth to reduce symptom duration",
                "To ensure emunctory organs (liver, kidneys, gut) are supported and drainage pathways are open",
                "To introduce high-dose probiotics to crowd out potential pathogens",
                "To restrict all carbohydrates to starve opportunistic bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before initiating 'killing' or 'detox' phases, the practitioner must ensure the patient's drainage pathways are open to prevent Herxheimer reactions and systemic reabsorption of toxins."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "When designing an Advanced Nutritional Program, why is 'Dietary Cycling' (e.g., moving from Ketogenic to Mediterranean) often preferred over long-term restrictive therapeutic diets?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent 'metabolic adaptation' and promote metabolic flexibility",
                "Because restrictive diets like AIP are only intended to be followed for 7 days",
                "To decrease the patient's reliance on whole-food nutrition",
                "To ensure the patient consumes at least 400g of carbohydrates daily for thyroid health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Long-term restriction can lead to metabolic adaptation, nutrient deficiencies, and reduced microbial diversity. Cycling promotes metabolic flexibility and long-term sustainment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A landmark study showed that 20mg of piperine administered with 2g of curcumin increased bioavailability by 2000% (20-fold) by inhibiting glucuronidation in the liver and intestinal wall."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "In Environmental Medicine, Phase II conjugation pathways in the liver require specific nutrient cofactors. Which nutrient is critical for the 'Sulfation' pathway, often depleted in patients with chemical sensitivities?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulfation requires sulfur donors like NAC and the mineral cofactor Molybdenum to convert toxic sulfites into usable sulfates."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "According to the Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change) discussed in Lesson 5, a patient who acknowledges they have a problem and is thinking about changing within the next 6 months is in which stage?",

                "Pre-contemplation",
                "Contemplation",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Contemplation is the stage where the individual is aware a problem exists and is seriously thinking about overcoming it but has not yet made a commitment to take action."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "A patient presents with SIBO, Chronic Fatigue, and Type 2 Diabetes. Using the 'Protocol Prioritization' framework, which area should typically be addressed first to achieve the greatest systemic leverage?",

                "Cosmetic skin treatments for inflammatory acne"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine, the gut is often the 'upstream' priority because intestinal permeability and dysbiosis drive systemic inflammation, which exacerbates fatigue and insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'Gold Standard' for measuring systemic, low-grade chronic inflammation and is used to track the success of an anti-inflammatory program?",

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "From a Professional Practice and Ethics standpoint, what is the primary purpose of a 'Functional Medicine Informed Consent' document?",
            "options": [
                "To guarantee the patient that they will be cured of all chronic illnesses",
                "To waive the practitioner's liability for any and all medical errors",
                "To clearly define the scope of practice, the nature of functional testing, and that the program does not replace primary medical care",
                "To prevent the patient from seeking a second opinion from a conventional doctor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires clear communication of scope, the experimental or 'functional' nature of some tests, and the collaborative (not replacement) role of the practitioner."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A case study patient has a Homocysteine level of 16.2 μmol/L (Optimal < 7.0). Which 'Targeted Supplementation' strategy is most appropriate for this biomarker outcome?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Homocysteine is a marker of methylation status. Elevated levels typically require methylated B12 (methylcobalamin), 5-MTHF (folate), and TMG to support the remethylation pathway."

        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Scalable Program Models,' why are Group-Based Functional Medicine programs (like the Cleveland Clinic model) showing high clinical success?",
            "options": [
                "They are cheaper for the practitioner to run",
                "They utilize 'Social Contagion' and peer support to increase behavioral adherence",
                "They allow the practitioner to spend less time with each patient",
                "They eliminate the need for individualized lab testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that group models improve outcomes because peer support, shared experience, and collective accountability significantly boost long-term adherence to lifestyle changes."
