Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you’re here for this lesson. We are diving into one of the most challenging, yet rewarding, parts of being a functional medicine practitioner. We’ve spent time talking about the psychology of how people change and how to keep them motivated. But today, we are shifting into the heavy clinical lifting. We’re going to talk about how you actually build a plan when a client walks into your office and looks like a walking puzzle.

In your career, you are going to meet the multi-morbid client. This is the person who doesn’t just have one issue. They don't just have a little bit of bloating. They come to you with five different diagnoses from three different specialists. They might have an autoimmune condition, a digestive disorder, and a hormonal imbalance all at the same time. It can feel overwhelming for them, and honestly, it can feel overwhelming for you, too. You might find yourself asking, where do I even start? How do I help this person without making them feel worse?

That is exactly what we are going to solve today. I’m going to give you what I call the master key to clinical prioritization. We’re going to learn how to look at a complex case and see the order of operations. We’re going to talk about the hierarchy of healing, how different systems in the body talk to each other, and how to adjust your approach for children and the elderly. By the end of this, you’ll have a clear roadmap for even the most complicated cases.

Let’s start with a reality check. Research from 2023 shows that over forty-two percent of adults over the age of fifty are living with multi-morbidity. That means nearly half of the older adults you see will have at least two chronic conditions. This isn't the exception anymore; it’s the rule. Our job is to find the common thread that links these conditions together.

I want you to think about the Hierarchy of Healing. This is our framework for clinical precedence. When a client has Hashimoto’s, SIBO, and PCOS all at once, you cannot use a shotgun approach. If you try to target everything on day one, you’re going to trigger a healing crisis. The client will feel terrible, they’ll stop following your advice, and you’ll lose their trust.

Instead, I want you to think about building a house. You would never try to pick out the wallpaper or install the smart home thermostat before you’ve poured the concrete foundation, right? The body works the same way. We have to work from the bottom up.

The very first level of our hierarchy is the Foundational layer. This is almost always the gastrointestinal system. We call this the node of Assimilation. Here’s why it comes first: if the gut is leaky or if there’s a major bacterial imbalance, it is constantly sending fire signals to the rest of the body. It drives systemic inflammation. It keeps the immune system in a state of high alert. You can give all the hormone support in the world, but if the gut is still leaking toxins into the bloodstream, those hormones won't be able to do their jobs. We have to fix the leak before we worry about the decor.

Once the gut is stable, we move to the second level, which is the Stability layer. This is the HPA axis, or your adrenals. I like to call this the metabolic reserve. Think of it as the battery for the entire body. You cannot ask a client to go through a heavy detoxification protocol or a major dietary overhaul if their battery is at five percent. The HPA axis provides the energy and the resilience needed for healing. If the adrenals are depleted, the body will perceive any intervention as a new stressor. We have to charge the battery before we turn on the heavy machinery.

The third level is the Regulatory layer. This is where we look at the thyroid and blood sugar. These are the thermostats of the body. They control the metabolic rate and the energy available for tissue repair. Healing is an energy-intensive process. If blood sugar is swinging up and down all day, or if the thyroid isn't producing enough energy at the cellular level, the body simply won't have the resources to repair damaged tissues. We have to stabilize the temperature of the house before we start the fine-tuning.

Finally, at the top of the hierarchy, we have the Specific layer. This is where we find sex hormones and specific autoimmune markers. Most clients come to us wanting to fix this layer first. They want to fix their low testosterone or their irregular periods. But in functional medicine, we know that these are often downstream effects. If you fix the gut, stabilize the adrenals, and balance the blood sugar, many of these hormonal issues will actually resolve on their own. We don't want to chase symptoms; we want to build a foundation that makes those symptoms unnecessary.

Now, let's talk about why these systems are so intertwined. In functional medicine, we recognize that no gland is an island. Your body is in a state of constant conversation. We call this endocrine cross-talk. Specifically, I want to talk about the HPA, HPT, and HPG axes. That’s the Adrenal, Thyroid, and Gonadal axes.

They are all connected. For example, let's say a client is under chronic stress. Their HPA axis is stuck in the "on" position. The body, in its infinite wisdom, says, "We are in a crisis. We don't have time to burn energy on metabolism or reproduction right now." So, it produces something called Reverse T3, or rT3. Think of rT3 as a brake pedal for your metabolism. It literally sits in the thyroid receptors and blocks the active thyroid hormone from getting in.

At the same time, high cortisol from that stress inhibits the conversion of T4, the inactive thyroid hormone, into T3, the active form. And it gets even more complex. High cortisol also tells the brain to downregulate the HPG axis. This leads to low progesterone in women and low testosterone in men. If you try to give that client thyroid hormone or testosterone without addressing the stress, you’re essentially hitting the gas and the brake at the same time. The client might end up feeling even more anxious, or they might start having heart palpitations because the underlying stress brake is still engaged. We have to manage the whole conversation, not just one voice.

I want to share a story with you that illustrates this perfectly. Let’s talk about Elena. Elena was forty-six years old, a very successful professional, but she was what we call "tired and wired." She was exhausted all day, but her mind would race at night. She had been gaining weight despite eating very little, her cycles were irregular, and she couldn't sleep.

She had already been to a conventional doctor and was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and perimenopause. They put her on levothyroxine, but she didn't feel any better. In fact, she felt more jittery. When we did her R.O.O.T.S. analysis, we saw the whole picture. Her stress levels were off the charts, which was her HPA axis. Because of that stress, her body was producing massive amounts of Reverse T3, so her thyroid hormone wasn't actually working at the cellular level. On top of that, she had estrogen dominance because her body wasn't clearing hormones properly.

Instead of just increasing her thyroid medication, which is what most people would do, we went back to our hierarchy. We started with HPA axis stabilization. We didn't even touch her thyroid for the first four weeks. We used adaptogenic herbs, we fixed her sleep hygiene, and we got her back in sync with her circadian rhythms.

Once she started sleeping and her "wired" feeling subsided, we moved to the next step. We supported her liver and her gut to help her body clear out that excess estrogen. And here is the amazing part: as her stress went down, her body stopped making so much Reverse T3. Her own thyroid hormone started working again. Her cycles regulated, and she finally lost the weight. She didn't need a higher dose of medication; she needed a better foundation. Today, Elena is actually using these same principles in her own wellness consultancy, and she’s earning over six figures helping others find that same balance. She’s a living example of why prioritization matters.

This brings us to a concept called Neuro-Endo-Immunology, or NEI. This is the supersystem of the body. It’s the bi-directional communication between your nervous system, your endocrine system, and your immune system. They are not separate. They are one giant loop.

Think about the Vagus nerve. It’s the main highway of your nervous system. It actually influences what we call the inflammatory reflex. If your nervous system is calm, it sends signals to your immune system to stay calm. But if you’re stressed, that signal breaks down, and inflammation can run wild.

Or look at Vitamin D. We call it a vitamin, but it’s actually a pro-hormone. It acts like a dimmer switch for your immune system. If your Vitamin D is low, your immune system might become overactive, leading to autoimmune flares.

Even the immune system talks back to the brain. When you have an infection or high inflammation, your immune system releases proteins called cytokines. These cytokines can actually cross the blood-brain barrier. They alter your neurotransmitters, which is why you get "brain fog" or feel depressed when you’re sick. It’s the immune system talking to the nervous system.

When a client has a "flare-up" of symptoms, your job as a coach is to look for the NEI trigger. Was it a stressful life event? That’s the nervous system entry point. Was it a high-sugar meal that spiked their insulin? That’s the endocrine entry point. Or was it a hidden gut infection or a seasonal virus? That’s the immune entry point. If you can identify where the flare started, you can pivot your protocol to address the root of that specific flare.

Now, while the R.O.O.T.S. Method is a universal framework, we have to be smart enough to adapt it for different stages of life. A child’s body is not just a small version of an adult’s body, and an elderly person has very different needs than a thirty-year-old.

Let’s look at pediatric considerations first. When you’re working with children, the primary goal is developmental support. Their bodies are growing at an incredible rate. Their metabolic rate is much higher than ours, and their blood-brain barrier is actually more permeable. This means they are more sensitive to everything—both the good and the bad.

In a pediatric protocol, we have to be very careful with detoxification. We don't want to be aggressive. Instead, we focus heavily on the Assimilation node. We want to make sure they are getting the high-quality nutrients and raw materials they need for growth. We want to make sure their gut is healthy so they can actually absorb those nutrients. It’s about building, not just cleaning.

On the other end of the spectrum, we have our geriatric clients. Here, the goal shifts to resilience and preservation. As we age, we often deal with something called anabolic resistance. This means the body isn't as efficient at using protein to build and maintain muscle. So, an older adult might actually need more high-quality protein than a younger person to prevent muscle loss.

We also have to consider achlorhydria, which is a fancy word for low stomach acid. It’s very common as we age. This means older adults often struggle to absorb Vitamin B12 and minerals. They might need more support with digestive enzymes or hydrochloric acid. But we also have to move slower. Their kidneys and liver don't filter toxins as quickly as they used to. We have to be gentle and patient, focusing on keeping their systems resilient rather than pushing for rapid change.

As you guide your clients through these protocols, you have to remember that a plan is a living document. It is not set in stone. You must be willing to pivot when the body gives you feedback. We look for what I call "Clinical Pivot Points." These are the red flags that tell us the current path is either too aggressive or just not the right fit for the client’s biology.

One of the most common red flags is a paradoxical reaction. This is when a client feels worse on a supplement that is supposed to be calming. For example, if you give someone Ashwagandha to help with stress, and they suddenly feel more anxious or can't sleep, that’s a paradoxical reaction. It’s a sign that their system is misaligned or that they have a specific genetic sensitivity. You have to stop and reassess.

Another red flag is a detox stall. It’s normal to have a little bit of a headache or a breakout when you first start a detox, but if those symptoms persist for more than seven days, something is wrong. It usually means the body’s elimination pathways—like the liver, kidneys, or gut—are backed up. You need to slow down and support those pathways before you continue.

You should also watch for rapid weight changes. If a client loses or gains more than five percent of their body weight in less than thirty days, that’s a red flag. It’s too much stress on the system. And finally, watch for cognitive decline. If a client tells you their brain fog is getting worse or they are having memory lapses after starting a new phase of the protocol, it’s a sign that inflammation is hitting the brain. That is an immediate signal to pivot.

A master practitioner knows when to stay the course and when to change direction. It’s not about being perfect; it’s about being responsive to the client’s unique bio-feedback.

Let’s take a moment to summarize what we’ve covered today, because we’ve gone deep into the clinical weeds.

First, always prioritize the foundation. You have to stabilize the gut and the HPA axis before you try to fix specific hormones or autoimmune issues. Remember the house metaphor: foundation first, decor last.

Second, respect the axes. Understand that the HPA, HPT, and HPG axes are all talking to each other. You cannot fix the thyroid in isolation if the adrenals are screaming. You have to look at the whole conversation.

Third, adapt for age. Children need developmental support and nutrient density, while seniors need help with resilience, protein absorption, and digestive support. One size does not fit all.

Fourth, keep your eye on the NEI loop. Use that connection between the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems to figure out what is actually triggering a client’s symptoms.

And finally, be flexible. Your protocol is a map, but the client’s body is the actual terrain. If the map doesn't match the terrain, follow the terrain. Watch for those red flags and don't be afraid to pivot.

You are doing such important work. Taking on these complex cases isn't easy, but it is where the most profound healing happens. When you can take someone who has been told "everything is normal" by five different doctors and show them the thread that connects their symptoms, you give them more than just a plan. You give them hope.

I want you to take a look at the case studies and the tables we’ve provided to really cement these concepts. Think about how you can apply the hierarchy of healing to the clients you’re already thinking about.

Great work today. You’re becoming the kind of practitioner the world really needs right now. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
