Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. Welcome back. I am so glad you are joining me for this specific lesson. We are moving into one of the most transformative phases of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™. In our last lesson, we focused heavily on targeted supplementation and nutrient replacement. We were looking at what the body was missing. But today, we are shifting our focus entirely. We are moving from replacement to environmental clearance.

Think of it this way. You can give a client the best supplements in the world, but if they are living in a burning building, the supplements can only do so much. We have to address the fire. In the world of functional medicine, we call this fire the Total Toxic Burden. This is not a quick fix. This is not a weekend juice cleanse or a detox tea you find at the grocery store. This is a structured, clinical phase designed to reduce the allostatic load on the mitochondria and the immune system.

I want to start by welcoming you into this practitioner mindset. We live in a modern world where we are exposed to over 80,000 different chemicals. The staggering part is that many of these have never actually been tested for human safety. For your clients, this represents a cumulative burden that can derail even the most perfect diet. You might have a client who is eating organic, sleeping eight hours, and managing their stress, yet they still feel like they are walking through sludge. This lesson is going to give you the clinical architecture to move beyond those generic detoxes and into sophisticated, evidence-based environmental medicine.

My goal for you today is to walk away with five specific skills. First, I want you to be able to quantify that Total Toxic Burden using functional testing and clinical questionnaires. Second, we are going to master the Drainage-Before-Detox rule. This is the single most important thing you will learn today to prevent those dreaded healing crises. Third, we will look at how to structure a multi-phase protocol for Biotoxin Illness, specifically CIRS, based on remediation and binders. Fourth, we are going to develop what I call the Clean Living Blueprint. This can reduce endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure by up to 60%. Finally, we will learn how to integrate physical modalities like infrared saunas and lymphatic drainage into a cohesive program.

Let's dive into the concept of the Total Toxic Burden. In functional medicine, we do not just look for one single poison. We are looking at the synergy of multiple low-level exposures. It is like a bucket. Every person has a bucket. Some people have a big bucket, and some have a small one based on their genetics. Every day, a little bit of lead from the old pipes, a little bit of glyphosate from a non-organic salad, and a little bit of fragrance from a laundry detergent drips into that bucket. For a long time, the body handles it. But eventually, the bucket overflows. That overflow is where we see the symptoms.

A major study published in The Lancet Planetary Health in 2022 estimated that environmental pollution is responsible for nine million deaths every year globally. That is a massive number. For your clients, this burden does not usually look like an acute poisoning. It looks like unexplained fatigue. It looks like brain fog that will not lift. It looks like weight loss resistance where no matter what they eat, the scale does not budge.

When you are assessing a client, I want you to focus on the Big Three. If you can address these three, you will usually clear about 80% of the interference. The first is Heavy Metals. We are talking about amalgams in the teeth, large predatory fish, or even well water. These cause mitochondrial inhibition and neurotoxicity. The second is Mycotoxins. These come from water-damaged buildings or stored grains. They lead to immune dysregulation and chronic fatigue. The third is Glyphosate. This is the most widely used herbicide in the world, found in non-organic produce and GMO crops. It causes gut dysbiosis and acts as a mineral chelator, essentially stealing minerals from the body.

I know this can feel overwhelming. There are so many toxins out there. But as a practitioner, if you focus on these three, you are providing incredible value. In fact, practitioners who specialize in these environmental resets often command fees between $2,500 and $5,000 for a four-month guided program because the level of clinical oversight is so high.

Now, let's talk about the most common mistake I see coaches and even some clinicians make. It is the sequencing. We have to talk about Biochemical Sequencing and the Drainage First rule. You might remember the three phases of detoxification from your basic biology, but let's look at them through a clinical lens.

Phase One is Modification. This is where enzymes, specifically the cytochrome P450 enzymes, transform fat-soluble toxins into intermediate metabolites. This phase requires B-vitamins and glutathione. But here is the catch. Those intermediate metabolites are often more reactive and more toxic than the original toxin.

Phase Two is Conjugation. This is where the body attaches a carrier, like sulfate or glycine, to that reactive metabolite to make it water-soluble. This requires amino acids and sulfur.

Phase Three is Elimination or what we call Drainage. This is the actual transport of those water-soluble toxins out of the cell and out of the body through bile, urine, and sweat.

Here is the clinical rule you must memorize: You must open the exit doors, which is Phase Three, before you start the cleaning crew, which is Phase One and Two. If a client is constipated, if their lymph is stagnant, or if they are dehydrated, a detox protocol will make them sicker. You are essentially stirring up dust in a room with no windows and no doors. The toxins just re-circulate, and because they were modified in Phase One, they are now even more dangerous to the nervous system.

Let me tell you a story about a client named Sarah. She was a 48-year-old former teacher. She came to me with severe brain fog and joint pain. She had heard about a popular seven-day liver cleanse and decided to try it. Within three days, she was crashing. She could barely get out of bed. When we looked at her history, the problem was obvious. Sarah had chronic constipation. She was only having a bowel movement once every three days.

We immediately stopped her liver cleanse. We spent three weeks focusing only on drainage. We used magnesium citrate to get her bowels moving daily. We had her drink three liters of mineralized water. We started dry brushing for her lymph. Once she was moving daily, we introduced very gentle binders like activated charcoal. The result was incredible. Sarah’s brain fog cleared by 60% before we even touched a liver-specific nutrient. Her body just needed the exit pathways cleared. This is the power of sequencing.

Next, I want to discuss something that is becoming more common in our clinical practices: Biotoxin Illness, also known as CIRS or Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. This is a multi-system illness usually caused by exposure to biotoxins from water-damaged buildings. Research suggests that about 25% of the population has a specific genetic susceptibility, the HLA-DR gene, that prevents their immune system from recognizing and clearing these toxins. For these people, mold is not just an allergen; it is a systemic poison.

If you are programming for CIRS recovery, you have to follow a very specific order. Step one is always removal from exposure. No protocol in the world will work if the client is still breathing in mold. You must insist on environmental testing like an ERMI test. Step two is binder therapy. We use agents like cholestyramine or natural alternatives like okra powder and bentonite clay to catch those toxins in the bile so they do not get reabsorbed. Step three is addressing MARCoNS, which is a type of resistant bacteria that hides in the deep nasal passages of mold patients. Finally, step four is repairing the blood-brain barrier using high-dose Omega-3s and specialized pro-resolving mediators.

When you work with CIRS clients, remember that they are often traumatized. They have been told by so many doctors that their symptoms are all in their head. Your first job is validation. I highly recommend using the Visual Contrast Sensitivity test. It is a simple, fifteen-dollar online tool. It provides objective data showing that their neurological function is actually impacted. It is often the first time these clients feel seen and heard.

Now, let's move into the Sustainability phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™. We call this the Clean Living Blueprint. We cannot live in a bubble, but we can control the internal environment of the home. Research shows that switching to organic produce for just one week can reduce urinary pesticide levels by over 90%. That is a high-leverage intervention you should program for every single client.

There are five pillars to a clean home. The first is Air. I recommend HEPA and carbon filtration to remove volatile organic compounds and mold spores. The second is Water. You want multi-stage filtration like reverse osmosis to remove fluoride, chlorine, and drug residues. The third is Personal Care. I use the Skin Rule: If you would not eat it, do not put it on your skin. We want to remove phthalates and anything labeled as fragrance. The fourth is the Kitchen. We want to replace non-stick pans with cast iron, stainless steel, or ceramic. Finally, there is EMF mitigation. Something as simple as turning off the Wi-Fi at night can support melatonin production and glymphatic drainage.

Speaking of drainage, let's talk about the physical modalities. Biochemical support is only half the battle. We have to physically move these toxins. The glymphatic system, which is the brain's waste clearance system, is 60% more active while we sleep. But it needs hydration and low inflammation to work.

One of the most effective tools we have is the Infrared Sauna. A 2018 study showed that sweat actually contains higher concentrations of heavy metals like lead and mercury than blood or urine. My standard protocol is 20 minutes, three times a week, followed immediately by a cold shower to rinse those toxins off the skin. We also use castor oil packs over the liver to stimulate bile flow. And do not forget the lymphatics. The lymphatic system does not have a pump. It needs movement. Five to ten minutes of rebounding or dry brushing towards the heart can move that interstitial fluid where toxins love to linger.

I do want to give you a quick coaching tip for your more sensitive clients. For someone with a very high toxic burden, a sauna can be too aggressive. They might feel wiped out for days. For those people, start with magnesium flake baths at a lukewarm temperature. This gently supports Phase Two detoxification without the intense heat of a sauna.

As you build your practice, consider the business side of this. You can partner with air and water filtration companies to offer your clients discounts. This adds value to your program and can provide a passive revenue stream. Many practitioners earn an additional $500 to $1,000 a month just by recommending the tools their clients already need for their recovery.

Let’s take a moment to check your understanding of what we have covered so far. I want you to think about these four questions.

First, why is it clinically dangerous to start a liver detox if a client is chronically constipated? Take a second to think about that. The answer, of course, is that Phase Three elimination is blocked. If the toxins cannot leave the body, they will re-circulate, often in a more toxic state, leading to a healing crisis.

Second, what percentage of the population has the genetic susceptibility that makes them prone to CIRS? The answer is 25%. This is why one person can live in a moldy house and feel fine, while their partner becomes completely debilitated.

Third, which physical modality is most effective for mobilizing heavy metals stored in fat cells? That would be the Infrared Sauna. The heat penetrates deep into the tissues to mobilize those stored toxins.

Finally, what is the Skin Rule in environmental medicine? It is simple: If you wouldn't eat it, don't put it on your skin. Our skin is our largest organ, and it absorbs what we put on it directly into the bloodstream.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with the key takeaways. Remember, sequencing is king. Always support drainage and use binders before you start inducing liver enzymes. Your client's home is their clinic. For long-term success, they must control their air, water, and food quality. Remember that CIRS is a genetic and environmental emergency that requires removal from exposure first. Binders are essential because, without them, many toxins just cycle through the bile and gut over and over again. And finally, use physical support like saunas and lymphatics to move the fluids of the body.

This work is so important. By helping your clients clear their environmental burden, you are giving their mitochondria the space they need to produce energy and heal. You are removing the obstacles to their vitality.

Great work today. You are building a very powerful toolkit. I will see you in the next lesson.
