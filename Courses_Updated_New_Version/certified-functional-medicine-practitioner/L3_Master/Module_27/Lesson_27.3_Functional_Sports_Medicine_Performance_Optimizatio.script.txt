Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you’ve joined me for this lesson. Today, we are diving into one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of functional medicine. We are talking about the high-performance athlete and the active adult.

In our previous lessons, we spent a lot of time looking at the bookends of life. We talked about pediatrics and we talked about geriatrics. But today, we are shifting our focus to that high-intensity metabolic demand of the active adult. These are the people who aren't just looking to avoid being sick. They are looking for peak physiological performance. They want to know how to push their bodies to the limit without breaking them.

Think about the clients you likely see every day. It’s not just the professional athlete on the cover of a magazine. It’s the forty-five-year-old nurse who is training for her very first marathon. It’s the corporate executive who uses Spartan races to manage his stress. It’s the weekend warrior who simply refuses to let their age dictate what they can do on the field or the trail. 

Our goal in this lesson is to bridge that gap between standard health and elite resilience. We are going to apply the R.O.O.T.S. Method directly to the athletic blueprint. We’re moving away from looking for pathology and moving toward mastering metabolic efficiency.

By the time we finish today, you’re going to be able to do some pretty incredible things for your clients. You’ll know how to interpret advanced biomarkers like VO2 max and lactate clearance. You’ll understand how to use Organic Acid Testing to find where energy production is getting stuck. We’re going to talk about building a performance matrix that balances training loads with hormonal recovery. We’ll look at nutrient timing and circadian hygiene. And very importantly, we’re going to talk about how to use antioxidants without accidentally ruining the very fitness gains your clients are working so hard for. We’ll also cover how to spot the early warning signs of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, or RED-S, which is a major risk for longevity.

Let’s start with the first phase of our method: the Reveal. In conventional sports medicine, the focus is almost always on repair. It’s about orthopedic surgery, physical therapy, or using NSAIDs to dull the pain of an injury. But in functional sports medicine, we start by looking at the internal environment. We want to know what is fueling the movement before the movement even happens.

One thing I want you to remember is that subclinical nutrient deficiencies are incredibly common. Recent research shows that up to forty-five percent of high-level recreational athletes are deficient in key nutrients. This isn't enough to land them in the hospital, but it is absolutely enough to slow down their recovery times and keep them from reaching their goals.

To reveal the true blueprint of an athlete, we have to look at metabolic flexibility. This is the body’s ability to shift seamlessly between burning fats and burning carbohydrates. We also look at lactate clearance. It’s a common misconception that lactate is just a waste product. It’s actually a fuel. We want to know how quickly the body can clear it or recycle it through the Cori cycle.

One of my favorite tools for this is Organic Acid Testing, or OAT. This test lets us look at the Krebs cycle intermediates. We look at things like citrate, succinate, and fumarate. When these markers are off, it tells us exactly where energy production is bottlenecked. 

You’ll have clients come to you all the time saying they’ve hit a wall. They’re doing everything right, but they just can’t get faster or stronger. Their conventional labs might look perfect. Their TSH is normal. Their basic blood work is fine. But then you run an OAT and you see elevated adipate or suberate. That is a huge reveal moment. It tells you that their body is failing at fatty acid oxidation. The intervention isn’t to tell them to train harder. The intervention is to fix the fuel line.

Now, once we have that data, we have to move into the Organize phase. We take all that information and we place it onto the Functional Medicine Matrix. When we’re working with athletes, we pay special attention to two specific nodes: Energy and Communication.

High-intensity training is a massive stressor. If the body can handle it, it leads to hormesis, which is that beautiful process where stress makes us stronger. But if the body can’t handle it, it leads to systemic collapse. 

In the Energy node, we’re looking at ATP production and mitochondrial density. Do they have enough CoQ10? Is there enough PQQ and Carnitine available to keep the engines running? In the Communication node, we’re looking at the HPA axis and the sex hormones. We’re looking at the ratio of cortisol to DHEA. We’re checking free testosterone levels. If these are out of balance, the athlete isn't going to recover, no matter how much they sleep.

We also have to look at Defense and Repair. This is where we monitor post-exercise inflammation. We look at CRP levels and see how the body is modulating cytokines. And we can’t forget Assimilation. Intense exercise can actually cause something called exercise-induced intestinal permeability. You might know it as leaky gut. If the gut is compromised, they aren't absorbing the nutrients they need to repair the damage from their workout.

Let me tell you about a client I worked with named Sarah. She was a forty-eight-year-old nurse and a very dedicated amateur triathlete. She came to me because she was experiencing profound fatigue. She had gained about ten pounds, mostly around her midsection, and she was struggling with brain fog. This was all happening while she was training twelve hours a week. Her regular doctor told her she was just getting older and that her labs were normal.

But when we did the Reveal phase, we found something different. Her functional testing showed a completely flat diurnal cortisol curve. Her ferritin was sitting at eighteen, which is incredibly low for someone with her activity level. Her OAT also showed very high markers of oxidative stress.

For our intervention, we actually did something that felt counterintuitive to her. We moved her into a twelve-week metabolic recovery phase. We cut out the high-intensity work and focused on Zone 2 training. We started her on iron bisglycinate and added adaptogens like Ashwagandha and Rhodiola. 

The outcome was amazing. Within four months, her energy was back. She lost eight pounds of that inflammatory weight. And the best part? She set a personal best in her next half-marathon while actually training with less volume. She was finally working with her physiology instead of against it.

This leads us into the Optimize phase. To truly optimize performance, we have to align the athlete with their biological clock. Nutrient timing is a huge part of this, but it’s not just about what they eat. It’s about when they eat it.

We have to talk about sleep. Research is very clear on this: getting less than seven hours of sleep increases injury risk by nearly double in competitive athletes. We optimize this through temperature regulation and melatonin pacing. I often recommend cold showers or cooling pads to help trigger the onset of deep sleep. We also make sure they aren't suppressing their natural melatonin with blue light after evening training sessions.

Another great strategy is nutrient pacing. Consuming a high-leucine protein, like a clean whey or pea protein, about thirty to sixty minutes before bed can stimulate muscle protein synthesis while they sleep. 

I want to pause here for a moment and talk to you as a practitioner. If you specialize in performance longevity for the forty-plus demographic, you are in a very high-value niche. These clients value their active lifestyle just as much as their careers. They are often willing to invest significantly—sometimes two to five thousand dollars for a six-month program—just to stay in the game. They don't want to be told to stop running; they want to be told how to run forever.

Next, we move into the Target phase. This is where we address specific biochemical imbalances. I see a lot of mistakes here, especially with antioxidants. There is a common trend of athletes taking high doses of Vitamin C and E right after a workout. But here’s the problem: that can actually blunt the mitochondrial adaptations we want. 

We need a precision dosing strategy. We want to avoid those high-dose antioxidants within four hours of training. We want the reactive oxygen species to signal for mitochondrial biogenesis. That’s how we get fitter. Now, there are exceptions. If someone is in a multi-day competition or training in extreme heat, we might use "rescue" antioxidants like liposomal glutathione or astaxanthin to prevent excessive tissue damage. But for daily training, we want that hormetic stress.

We also focus on magnesium. It’s required for over three hundred enzymatic reactions, including muscle contraction and relaxation. I usually suggest Magnesium Malate for daytime use because of its role in the Krebs cycle, and Magnesium Glycinate for the evening to support recovery.

Finally, we have the Sustain phase. This is all about longevity. The biggest threat to an athlete’s long-term health is RED-S, or Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport. This used to be called the Female Athlete Triad, but we now know it affects everyone. It impacts metabolic rate, bone health, immunity, and protein synthesis.

When you’re looking at the Matrix, RED-S shows up as low T3 and suppressed sex hormones. You might see an unexpectedly low resting heart rate or frequent infections. Psychologically, the athlete might be more irritable or lose their competitive drive.

When you’re talking to an ambitious client about this, don’t just tell them they need to eat more. They might resist that. Instead, frame it as "fueling for output." Use the analogy of a high-performance car. You can’t win a race if your fuel tank is only ten percent full. Eventually, the engine is going to seize. They need to understand that food is the fuel that allows them to perform.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key thoughts. Remember to use the Reveal phase to look for metabolic bottlenecks with OAT and VO2 max. In the Organize phase, keep a close eye on the Energy and Communication nodes to prevent burnout. In the Optimize phase, remember that circadian hygiene and pre-sleep protein are non-negotiable, especially for your clients over forty. In the Target phase, be strategic with antioxidants—don't blunt the benefits of the workout. And in the Sustain phase, always be vigilant for RED-S to protect their long-term bone and metabolic health.

If you are coming into this as a career changer, don't forget that your life experience is a huge asset. You understand the complexity of managing stress, family, and a career. That makes you incredibly relatable to the master's athlete. They don’t want a twenty-two-year-old trainer who doesn't understand what it’s like to have a mortgage and a demanding job. They want a functional practitioner who understands the nuances of forty-five-year-old physiology.

You have the tools now to help these clients achieve things they thought were long gone. You’re helping them not just reach a finish line, but stay healthy enough to keep racing for decades to come.

Great work today. I’m really proud of the progress you’re making. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
