Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you are here with me today for this incredibly important lesson. We are diving into a topic that many practitioners find intimidating, but it is perhaps one of the most rewarding areas where you can apply your expertise. We are talking about integrative oncology support. In our previous lessons, we spent time looking at specialized populations like pediatrics and geriatrics. We looked at how the body changes as it grows and how it shifts as it ages. But today, we are going to apply the R.O.O.T.S. Method to the complex and often overwhelming landscape of oncology. 

This is a shift in perspective. Most of the conventional world is focused, quite rightly, on fighting the tumor. They are looking at the seed. But as Functional Medicine coaches, we shift our focus to optimizing the host. We are looking at the soil. Our goal is to ensure that the client’s physiology is as resilient as possible, both during the rigors of conventional treatment and in the long years of recovery that follow. We want to move beyond just surviving a diagnosis and help our clients truly thrive.

Let's start by talking about this new paradigm in cancer support. It is so important to understand right from the beginning that integrative oncology is not about replacing conventional care. We are not here to choose between chemotherapy and nutrition. We are here to provide the foundation that makes conventional care more effective and less toxic. Think of it as optimizing the soil in which the tumor resides. As a practitioner, your role is to address the systemic imbalances that can fuel oncogenesis or hinder recovery. We are looking at things like chronic inflammation, insulin signaling, and oxidative stress. These are the metabolic drivers that can either help a tumor grow or help a body heal. This lesson is going to give you the clinical framework to support these clients with confidence and with deep compassion.

Before we get into the details, I want to lay out our roadmap for today. By the end of this session, you will be able to identify the key biomarkers we use to assess what I call the oncogenic terrain. We will talk about things like IGF-1, hs-CRP, and glycemic variability. You will learn how to apply the Functional Medicine Matrix to map out the systemic imbalances in a cancer patient, looking at how their history and their treatment intersect. We are also going to explore some really exciting therapeutic nutritional strategies, like the Fasting-Mimicking Diet, which can actually enhance treatment efficacy. We will talk about how to design nutraceutical protocols to mitigate the toxicity that often comes with treatment, specifically looking at the liver and the gut. And finally, we will look at how to develop long-term surveillance plans that focus on metabolic resilience and reducing the risk of recurrence.

To help ground all of this in reality, I want to share a story with you. Let’s talk about Linda. Linda was a 52-year-old former educator when she came to see me. She had recently finished treatment for Stage Two breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy and had completed several rounds of chemotherapy. On paper, Linda was a success story. Her oncologist told her she was cancer-free. But if you talked to Linda, she didn't feel like a success. She was struggling with debilitating chemo-brain. She had Grade Two peripheral neuropathy, which meant her feet and hands were constantly tingling or numb. And her fatigue was so severe she could barely get through a grocery store trip. 

Linda felt like she had been poisoned. She was living in constant fear that the cancer would come back because she didn't understand why it had happened in the first place. When we used the R.O.O.T.S. Method with Linda, we started by revealing her terrain. We found that her fasting insulin was 18, which is quite high, and her inflammation marker, hs-CRP, was at 4.2. Even though the tumor was gone, the environment that allowed it to grow was still very much present. 

We organized her care around mitochondrial repair and glycemic control. We didn't do anything radical. We just helped her transition to a time-restricted feeding schedule to lower that insulin and started her on targeted Alpha-Lipoic Acid for her neuropathy. Within four months, Linda’s neuropathy scores improved by sixty percent. Her brain fog cleared up, and she felt like herself again. Most importantly, her fasting insulin dropped to 7. Linda actually felt so empowered by this process that she became a wellness consultant herself. She’s now earning a supplemental income while advocating for this kind of integrative support. That is the power of focusing on the host.

Now, let’s move into the first phase of our method: Revealing the Oncogenic Terrain. In Functional Medicine, we don't view cancer as just a random genetic accident. We see it as a systemic process that is heavily influenced by the environment of the body. To support a client effectively, we have to reveal the metabolic and inflammatory drivers that might be promoting tumor growth or making the body resistant to treatment. 

There was a fascinating study published in Nature Reviews Cancer in 2022. It highlighted that systemic metabolic health is one of the primary determinants of cancer outcomes. This means that how the rest of the body functions matters just as much as what the cancer cells are doing. We focus on four critical biomarkers. 

The first is IGF-1, or Insulin-like Growth Factor 1. This is a potent signaling molecule. It promotes cellular growth and, unfortunately, it also inhibits apoptosis, which is the body's natural way of programmed cell death. In an oncology setting, we want to see this between 120 and 150, depending on the client’s age. If it’s too high, it’s like putting high-octane fuel in a car that we want to slow down.

The second marker is hs-CRP. This is our primary marker for systemic inflammation. We know that high levels of inflammation correlate with a poorer prognosis. We want this to be as low as possible, ideally under 1.0. 

Then we have fasting insulin. This is perhaps the most under-addressed driver in all of oncology. Many cancer cells actually overexpress insulin receptors. This means they are incredibly sensitive to the growth signals that insulin sends. High insulin fuels something called the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. You don't need to memorize that, but you should know it is a major driver of cancer growth. We want fasting insulin between 2.0 and 5.0. By helping your clients achieve what I call metabolic silence through low-glycemic living, you are essentially starving those growth signaling pathways without harming the healthy cells.

Finally, we look at LDH, or Lactate Dehydrogenase. High levels of LDH can indicate a shift in how the body uses glucose. This is known as the Warburg Effect, where cells shift toward anaerobic metabolism even when oxygen is present. It’s a hallmark of cancer metabolism. We look for a range between 140 and 180. 

I want you to remember that hyperinsulinemia is one of the biggest missed opportunities in conventional oncology. When you help a client manage their blood sugar, you are doing profound work. You are changing the very chemistry of the environment.

Next, we move to Organizing the Host Environment. This is where we use the Functional Medicine Matrix to see how a client’s history and their current physiology intersect with their diagnosis. When we are organizing an oncology case, we are looking specifically at how conventional treatments have impacted the different nodes of the body. 

Think about the Defense and Repair node. Chemotherapy and radiation are, by their very nature, pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory. That is how they kill cancer cells. But while they are targeting the tumor, they are also depleting the body’s natural antioxidant reserves. They use up glutathione and superoxide dismutase. As a coach, you have to map out the client’s ability to quench this fire once the active treatment is over. If they can't repair that oxidative damage, they stay in that state of chronic fatigue and inflammation.

We also have to look at the Biotransformation and Elimination node. The liver is the primary organ responsible for clearing out chemotherapy metabolites. If this node is sluggish, perhaps because of genetic factors or just a lack of the right nutrients to fuel the detoxification pathways, the client is going to feel poisoned. That malaise, that heavy, toxic feeling that Linda described, usually comes back to a liver that is overwhelmed and under-supported.

Now, let’s talk about one of the most exciting frontiers in this work: Optimizing Metabolic Flexibility. We call this Metabolic Priming. Research by brilliant scientists like Dr. Valter Longo has shown that cancer cells and healthy cells respond very differently to nutrient deprivation. This is a phenomenon called Differential Stress Resistance, or DSR. 

Here is how it works. When you take away nutrients, like when a person fasts, healthy cells go into a protective maintenance and repair mode. They hunker down and wait for the storm to pass. But cancer cells are different. Because of their oncogenic mutations, they are hard-wired to grow. They can't shift into that protective mode. So, when nutrients are scarce, they actually become more vulnerable.

This has led to the development of the Fasting-Mimicking Diet, or FMD, in the context of chemotherapy. Implementing a five-day FMD prior to a chemo cycle has been shown in clinical trials to do three amazing things. First, it protects healthy cells. By shifting them into maintenance mode, it makes them more resistant to the toxic effects of the drugs. Second, it sensitizes the cancer cells, making the chemo more effective against them. And third, it significantly reduces side effects. Patients report much less nausea, less fatigue, and fewer digestive issues. 

Now, a very important coach tip here: Never implement fasting or intensive nutritional protocols without coordinating with the client’s oncology team. You should frame it as supportive nutrition to enhance resilience. Most oncologists are actually very open to strategies that reduce side effects and help their patients stay on their treatment plan. It is all about how you communicate it.

Once we have optimized that foundation, we move to Targeting Treatment Toxicity. This is where we address the specific side effects that often make patients want to give up on their conventional care. 

One of the biggest issues is mucosal integrity and gut health. Chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cells. That’s why it works on cancer, but it’s also why it hits the lining of the GI tract so hard. This leads to mucositis and what we call leaky gut. We can target this with things like L-Glutamine, up to 15 grams a day, along with Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice and specific probiotics like Saccharomyces boulardii. These help maintain that mucosal barrier and keep the gut from becoming a source of systemic inflammation.

Then there is the issue of mitochondrial recovery and chemo-brain. That cognitive decline is largely a result of mitochondrial damage and neuroinflammation. The drugs cross into the brain and cause oxidative stress in the microglia, the brain's immune cells. To target this, we use nutrients that support mitochondrial biogenesis. Things like PQQ, CoQ10, and Acetyl-L-Carnitine can be game-changers for a client who feels like they’ve lost their mental edge.

I want to take a moment here to talk to you as a coach. Many of the people drawn to this work, especially women in their 40s and 50s, come to it after their own health battles. Your empathy is your greatest clinical tool. Clients in oncology support don't just need a protocol. They need a partner. They need someone who understands the fear of a clean scan that doesn't actually feel clean. When you can sit with a client and acknowledge that fear while giving them a plan, you are providing a level of care that is rare and precious.

Finally, we look at Sustaining Long-Term Recovery. This is where Functional Medicine truly shines. In the conventional world, once treatment is over, the approach is often watch and wait. But in our world, we prefer proactive surveillance. We want to do everything we can to make the body an inhospitable place for cancer to return.

A 2023 meta-analysis of over ten thousand breast cancer survivors found something remarkable. Those who maintained a BMI under 25 and kept their HbA1c under 5.4 percent had a 35 percent lower risk of recurrence. That is a massive statistic. It tells us that metabolic silence is our best defense. 

We also look at circadian biology. Melatonin is not just for sleep; it is a potent oncostatic agent. It actually helps inhibit tumor growth. Ensuring that your clients have deep sleep in a completely dark environment is a foundational part of recurrence prevention. 

We also gradually reintroduce what we call hormetic stress. This includes things like exercise and sauna therapy. These activities stimulate autophagy, which is the body's way of cleaning up damaged cells. It’s like a cellular spring cleaning. And of course, we can't forget the psychological side. Addressing the Defense and Repair node through community, purpose, and stress management is vital. A body in a state of constant fight-or-flight is not a body that can easily sustain recovery.

I want to encourage you to think about specializing in this niche. It is incredibly rewarding. Because the level of expertise required is high, practitioners in this field can often command premium rates, but more importantly, the value you provide to a client facing their greatest fear is immeasurable. Your certification is the first step toward becoming a trusted specialist in this field.

Let’s do a quick check of our understanding. Think about why we measure IGF-1 in the revealing phase. Remember, it’s a signaling molecule. High levels create a pro-growth environment. We want to know if the body is sending out signals that tell cells to divide and stay alive when they shouldn't.

What about the primary mechanism of the Fasting-Mimicking Diet? It’s that Differential Stress Resistance. We are using biology to protect the healthy and expose the vulnerable. 

And when a client feels poisoned after chemo, which node are we looking at? That’s the Biotransformation and Elimination node. We need to help the liver and the detox pathways clear out the remnants of the treatment. 

Finally, what biomarker indicates the Warburg Effect? That is LDH. It tells us if the body’s cells are shifting toward a less efficient, more cancer-friendly way of making energy.

As we wrap up, let’s go over the key takeaways. First, integrative oncology is about the soil, not just the seed. We focus on the host environment. Second, we reveal the drivers of growth by monitoring insulin, IGF-1, and systemic inflammation. Third, we use metabolic flexibility to protect healthy cells and sensitize cancer cells during treatment. Fourth, we target the specific side effects like neuropathy and chemo-brain by supporting the mitochondria and the gut. And fifth, we sustain recovery by maintaining metabolic silence and honoring the body’s natural rhythms.

You have done great work today. This is heavy material, but it is so vital. By understanding these mechanisms, you are positioning yourself to help people navigate one of the most difficult journeys of their lives with grace and with real, science-backed hope. I am proud of the work you are doing.

Great work today. See you in the next lesson.
