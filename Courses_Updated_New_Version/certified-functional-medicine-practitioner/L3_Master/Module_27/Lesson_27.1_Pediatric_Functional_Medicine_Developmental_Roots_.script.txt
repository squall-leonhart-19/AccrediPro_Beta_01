Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’ve joined me for this lesson. We are stepping into what I personally believe is the most rewarding, most impactful, and perhaps the most vital area of functional medicine: Pediatrics. Up until this point in the certification, we’ve spent a lot of time talking about adult physiology. We’ve looked at how to untangle decades of chronic dysfunction, how to reverse metabolic damage, and how to help adults regain the vitality they lost years ago. But today, everything changes. We are shifting our focus from maintaining or restoring health to something much more profound. We are talking about building the physiological foundation for an entire lifetime.

When we apply the R.O.O.T.S. Method™ to children, we aren't just looking at symptoms. We are looking at the very beginning of a human story. In pediatric functional medicine, we have a unique opportunity that we rarely get with adults. We have the chance to intervene during critical developmental windows. By doing this, we aren't just resolving a skin rash or helping a child focus in school. We are actually altering that child’s epigenetic trajectory. We are changing the way their genes will express themselves for the next eighty or ninety years. For those of you coming into this from a background in education or nursing, or maybe you’re a parent who found this path because of your own child’s health journey, this module is where your clinical expertise meets your passion for the next generation.

In this lesson, I want to take you through a comprehensive roadmap. We’re going to start by analyzing the first one thousand days of life. This is a period that starts at conception and goes through a child’s second birthday. We’ll look at how the maternal microbiome and the method of delivery—whether it’s vaginal or C-section—create the initial blueprint for the immune system. Then, we’re going to take our Functional Medicine Matrix and adapt it for kids. We’ll look at how things like sensory processing and neurodevelopmental delays show up in the different nodes of the matrix. We’ll also spend time on the nutritional foundation, looking at how we can use food as information to support cognitive growth. We’ll tackle some of the more complex issues, like PANS and PANDAS, which are often misunderstood in conventional settings. And finally, I’ll show you how to implement a family-centered care model. Because in pediatrics, you aren't just coaching a child; you are coaching a family system.

To really ground this in reality, I want to tell you about a client of mine named Leo. Leo was six years old when his mother brought him to see me. On the surface, Leo was struggling with what many kids struggle with today. He had a diagnosis of ADHD, he had terrible "brain fog" that made school a nightmare, and he suffered from chronic, painful eczema. He was also prone to what his mother called "behavioral volatility." These weren't just standard tantrums; these were intense emotional meltdowns that would leave both Leo and his parents exhausted. He also had a history of recurrent ear infections, which is a major red flag we see in pediatric cases.

When we started the Reveal phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™, we went all the way back to the beginning. Leo was born via an emergency C-section. Because of those recurrent ear infections, he had already been through four rounds of broad-spectrum antibiotics before he even turned two. When we looked at his mother’s history, we found she had struggled with IBS and gestational diabetes during the pregnancy. This gave us so much information. We could see that Leo’s microbial foundation was shaky from the start.

Instead of just recommending more behavioral therapy or topical creams for his skin, we used the Matrix to organize his symptoms. We focused heavily on the Assimilation node—his gut—and the Defense and Repair node—his immune system. We removed gluten and dairy, which were clear triggers for his inflammation. We introduced high-dose, clean Omega-3s to support his brain, and we started a gentle, kid-friendly 5-R gut protocol to heal his intestinal lining and balance his microbiome.

The results were life-changing for that family. After four months, Leo’s eczema was ninety percent cleared. But more importantly, his teacher sent a note home saying there was a significant increase in his ability to focus. Those daily emotional meltdowns? They dropped to maybe once a week. For the practitioner working with him—who happened to be a former school teacher—this wasn't just a clinical success. It was a professional turning point. That one case represented about thirty-five hundred dollars in revenue, but more than that, it created a lifelong referral source because when you help a child, the parents tell everyone they know.

Now, let’s talk about why the history is so important. In pediatric medicine, the chronology doesn't start on the day the child is born. It starts before conception. We talk about the First 1,000 Days because this is when the epigenetic blueprint is largely set. Research into the developmental origins of health and disease tells us that the environment in the womb and the experiences of the first two years of life can predict health outcomes decades later. When you are revealing a pediatric history, you have to be a bit of a detective. You’re looking for factors that conventional doctors often overlook because they don't see the connection between a C-section and a behavioral issue six years later.

One of the most critical pieces of this puzzle is the microbial transfer. A child’s microbiome is primarily seeded during the birth process and through early feeding. When a baby passes through the vaginal canal, they are coated in critical Lactobacillus species that prime their immune system. When a child is born via C-section, they bypass this process. Instead of being colonized by their mother’s beneficial bacteria, they are often colonized by the bacteria found in the hospital environment. Research shows this can lead to a higher rate of atopy—which is the clinical term for that triad of allergies, asthma, and eczema.

We also have to look at maternal dysbiosis. If the mother has an imbalanced microbiome during pregnancy, she isn't able to pass on a healthy microbial "starter kit" to her baby. This can lead to increased risks of colic and early food sensitivities. Then there’s the issue of antibiotics. If a child receives antibiotics early in life, it can deplete their commensal flora and lead to increased intestinal permeability, or what we often call leaky gut. And finally, we look at the difference between formula and breast milk. Breast milk contains Human Milk Oligosaccharides, or HMOs. These aren't actually for the baby to digest; they are specifically there to feed the baby’s Bifidobacterium. Formula, while it has come a long way, often lacks these complex sugars, which can lead to lower levels of those beneficial bacteria.

When you’re talking to parents about this, I want you to lead with deep compassion. Many mothers carry an enormous amount of guilt if they had a C-section or if they weren't able to breastfeed. Your job is to help them let go of that guilt. Reframe this information as valuable data. Tell them, "This isn't your fault, but knowing this allows us to give your child exactly what they need right now to catch up microbially." We aren't looking back to blame; we are looking back to understand the terrain.

Next, let’s look at how we organize these pediatric dysfunctions on the Matrix. The Matrix is still our primary tool, but the way the nodes express themselves in children is different than in adults. In an adult, a gut issue might show up as bloating or heartburn. In a child, that same gut issue might show up as a sensory processing disorder or an inability to sit still in class.

In the Assimilation node, we are looking at the gut-brain axis. In children, this axis is incredibly sensitive. If a child has intestinal permeability, undigested food proteins and bacterial toxins like lipopolysaccharides, or LPS, can cross into the bloodstream. From there, they can actually cross the blood-brain barrier. This triggers neuro-inflammation, which we see as a primary driver in many cases of autism spectrum disorder and ADHD. The gut is truly the second brain, and in pediatrics, it’s often the first place we need to look when behavior is a concern.

Then we have the Defense and Repair node. This is where we see what clinicians call the Atopic March. This is a very specific progression where we see eczema in infancy, which then turns into food allergies, and eventually develops into asthma as the child gets older. This represents a specific kind of immune imbalance called TH2 dominance. Our goal in functional medicine is to restore the function of T-regulatory cells. These are the "peacekeeper" cells of the immune system that help balance the response so the body doesn't overreact to every environmental trigger.

When we move into the phase of optimizing the pediatric terrain, our mantra is Food as Information. Children are not just small adults. Their metabolic demands are immense because they are literally building new tissue, new bone, and new brain connections every single second. A very important study from 2022 found that children who consumed a diet high in processed foods actually had significantly lower hippocampal volume. The hippocampus is the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning. So, when we talk about nutrition, we aren't just talking about weight or physical health; we are talking about the physical structure of their developing brains.

To build an anti-inflammatory foundation, we focus on a few key pillars. First, Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically DHA and EPA. These are critical for myelination—which is like the insulation on the wiring of the brain—and for synaptic plasticity. I can't tell you how many children I see with behavioral issues who are profoundly deficient in these healthy fats. Second, we want phytochemical diversity. We tell kids to "eat the rainbow" because those different colors represent different prebiotics that feed a healthy microbiome. And third, we have to talk about blood sugar stability. Those spikes and crashes in glucose that come from sugary cereals or processed snacks are often mistaken for ADHD or behavioral problems in the classroom. A child who is crashing from a sugar high cannot regulate their emotions or their focus.

One of my favorite coaching tips for parents is the "Crowding Out" method. Parents are often overwhelmed and stressed, and the last thing they want is a long list of things they have to take away from their child. Instead of focusing on what to remove, focus on what to add. I often suggest adding a "brain-power smoothie" every morning. If you can get blueberries, spinach, and hemp seeds into a child first thing in the morning, you are flooding their system with nutrients. Naturally, they will have less of an appetite for the sugary stuff. It’s a much more positive way to approach dietary changes.

Now, I want to address one of the most complex and often heart-wrenching areas of pediatric functional medicine: PANS and PANDAS. PANS stands for Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome, and PANDAS is the version specifically associated with Streptococcal infections. This is a situation where the immune system gets "misdirected." Instead of just fighting off an infection, the immune system starts to attack the basal ganglia in the child’s brain.

The hallmark of PANS and PANDAS is the "overnight" onset. Parents will often tell you that their child woke up a different person. They might suddenly develop intense OCD, or motor tics, or severe separation anxiety. You might see a sudden loss of handwriting skills, which we call dysgraphia. Or you might see a sudden return of bedwetting in a child who has been potty trained for years. These are major clinical red flags.

In the Target phase for these children, we have to move beyond just the foundations. We have to identify the specific triggers—whether it’s a lingering Strep infection, or exposure to Lyme or mold. While we address those triggers, we use natural anti-inflammatories like Curcumin and Boswellia to help "quench" the neuro-immune fire in the brain. But here is the most important thing to remember as a coach: PANS and PANDAS families are often in a state of total crisis. They have been dismissed by many doctors and they are exhausted. Your role in these cases is as much about being an emotional anchor as it is about being a clinical practitioner. You have to establish a "calm-down" protocol for the parents just as much as you do a supplement protocol for the child. If the parents can't regulate their own nervous systems, the child won't be able to heal.

As we move into the Sustain phase, we focus on family-centered resilience. In pediatrics, the child is part of an ecosystem. If the parents are chronically stressed and the pantry is still full of inflammatory triggers, the child is going to struggle to maintain their progress. We have to build sustainability through health literacy for the whole family.

We teach parents about epigenetic signaling. We explain that their daily choices—everything from sleep hygiene to the cleaning products they use to how they co-regulate their emotions with their child—are sending signals to the child’s genes. Our ultimate goal isn't to create a child who has to live in a bubble. Our goal is metabolic resilience. We want to get the child to a place where they can occasionally have a cupcake at a birthday party without their entire physiological system collapsing. We want them to be able to handle the world.

From a professional perspective, there is something I call the "halo effect" in pediatric care. When you successfully help a child, something inevitable happens. The mother and the father will look at the results and say, "Wait, if you could help my son’s brain fog and skin, can you help me with my fatigue and my digestion?" This often leads to "Family Care," where you end up working with the whole household. This can easily double or triple your client lifetime value without you ever having to spend another dollar on marketing. It is a beautiful way to build a practice that is both financially sustainable and deeply fulfilling.

To wrap things up, let’s go over the key takeaways from today’s lesson. First, in the Reveal phase, remember that a pediatric history must go back to the very beginning. You need to know about maternal health, the delivery method, and early antibiotic use to truly understand that child’s microbial foundation. Second, when you look at the Matrix, remember that childhood "behavior" is very often a symptom of biological dysfunction, particularly in the Assimilation and Defense and Repair nodes. Third, when you are in the Target phase for complex neuro-immune conditions like PANS, you need a dual approach: you have to remove the infectious trigger while simultaneously quenching the inflammation in the brain. And finally, for the Sustain phase, remember that success in pediatrics requires a family-centered model. You are optimizing the environment and the parents alongside the child.

I know this can feel like a lot of responsibility. Working with children is a big task. But remember, you have the R.O.O.T.S. Method™ to guide you. You have the tools to look past the labels and the symptoms to find the true underlying causes. Every time you help a child find their health, you are changing the future. You are giving that child a chance to reach their full potential without being held back by physiological imbalances.

Great work today. Take some time to review the case study of Leo and think about how those nodes on the Matrix connected for him. I’ll see you in the next lesson where we’ll dive even deeper into pediatric gut health. Keep going, you’re doing incredible work.
