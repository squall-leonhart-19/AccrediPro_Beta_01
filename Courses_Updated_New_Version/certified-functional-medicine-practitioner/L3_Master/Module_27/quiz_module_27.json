            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Regarding Geriatric Resilience, 'Inflammaging' is a core driver of age-related decline. Which biomarker is most strongly correlated with 'senescence-associated secretory phenotype' (SASP) and serves as a predictor of frailty and 10-year mortality?",

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Neuropsychiatric research highlights the 'Kynurenine Shunt' as a link between inflammation and depression. What is the mechanism by which pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IFN-gamma) cause neurotransmitter imbalances?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Type 1.5 'Glycotoxic' Alzheimer's is a hybrid where high insulin levels cause inflammation (Type 1), while the resulting insulin resistance leads to a lack of trophic support for the brain (Type 2)."
