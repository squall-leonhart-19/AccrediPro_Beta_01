Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you are joining me for this session. In our last lesson, we spent a lot of time talking about the very beginning of life. We looked at pediatrics and how the developmental roots of health are planted in those early years. But today, we are shifting our focus to the other end of the life cycle. We are going to talk about the art and science of aging.

As we apply the R.O.O.T.S. Method to the aging process, we are moving away from the standard model of crisis-based geriatric care. You know the one I mean. It is the model that waits for a fall, waits for a diagnosis of dementia, or waits for a chronic disease to become unmanageable before intervening. Instead, we are going to focus on the cultivation of physiological resilience.

Welcome to this specialty lesson. As our global population ages, the demand for practitioners who can navigate the complexities of geriatric health is absolutely skyrocketing. Conventional geriatrics often defaults to a mindset of managing decline. It is almost as if the system expects people to simply wither away. In this lesson, I want to challenge that paradigm with you. You are going to learn how to identify the molecular drivers of aging and implement protocols that do not just add years to a person’s life, but truly add life to those years. This is where your expertise in Functional Medicine becomes a vital bridge to true longevity for your clients.

Before we dive into the science, let us look at what we are going to accomplish together. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to identify advanced biomarkers of cellular senescence and what we call the inflammaging phenotype. You will know how to use the Functional Medicine Matrix to organize the chaos of multi-morbidity and polypharmacy that we so often see in elderly clients. We are going to talk about developing nutritional and lifestyle protocols to reverse sarcopenia and restore that essential anabolic drive. We will also look at the Bredesen-style multi-modal approach to prevent and address early-stage cognitive decline. And finally, we will implement long-term healthspan strategies that focus on metabolic flexibility and the power of social connectivity.

I want to start with a story because I think it illustrates exactly why this work is so profound. Let me tell you about Evelyn. Evelyn was a 79-year-old retired librarian when she first came to see us. She was the classic picture of what conventional medicine calls failing to thrive. She had progressive muscle weakness, what we call sarcopenia. She was struggling with mild cognitive impairment and a constant sense of brain fog that made her feel like she was losing herself. On top of that, she was taking nine different medications. She had pills for hypertension, high cholesterol, insomnia, and osteopenia. She felt over-medicated and under-served.

When we looked deeper using our Functional Medicine lens, we found some really revealing data. Her high-sensitivity CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation, was at 4.8 milligrams per liter. That is quite high and a clear sign of systemic inflammaging. Her Vitamin D was sitting at a low 22 nanograms per milliliter, and her protein intake was chronically low. She was only eating about 0.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. She was essentially starving her muscles and her brain.

Our intervention was focused and strategic. We consolidated her supplement routine to reduce the pill burden. We implemented what I call a Bredesen-lite ketogenic diet, focusing on healthy fats and bumping her protein up to 1.4 grams per kilogram. We also introduced very simple resistance band training just twice a week.

The outcome was nothing short of life-changing for her. After six months, Evelyn’s MoCA score, which measures cognitive function, improved from a 23 to a 27. Her grip strength increased by 15 percent, which is a huge predictor of longevity. Most importantly, her hs-CRP dropped from 4.8 all the way down to 1.1. Under her doctor’s supervision, she was able to successfully discontinue three of her medications. Evelyn went from failing to thrive to truly living again.

So, let us talk about the science behind a case like Evelyn’s. In Functional Medicine, we do not view aging as an inevitable slide into decay. Instead, we see it as a cumulative process of cellular senescence and systemic inflammation. There is a term for this that I want you to remember: inflammaging. This is a low-grade, chronic, systemic inflammation that acts as the primary driver for almost every age-related disease we fear, from Alzheimer’s to cardiovascular disease.

To effectively reveal this geriatric phenotype, we have to look way beyond the standard blood panels. A 2022 study published in Nature Aging highlighted that biological age often differs significantly from chronological age. You might have a 70-year-old client with the biology of a 50-year-old, or vice versa. To find out where they really stand, we look at specific biomarkers.

First, we look at hs-CRP and Interleukin-6. These are the dual pillars of inflammaging. For true longevity, we want to see that hs-CRP under 1.0. Then there is Cystatin C. This is a much more sensitive marker of renal function in the elderly than the standard creatinine test. Why? Because creatinine is a byproduct of muscle, and since many elderly people have lost muscle mass, their creatinine levels can look falsely normal even when their kidneys are struggling.

We also look at Homocysteine. This tells us about methylation status. If levels are over 12 micromoles per liter, we see a very strong correlation with cognitive decline and brain atrophy. And finally, there is GlycA. This is a newer marker of systemic inflammation that predicts cardiovascular risk and mortality more accurately than CRP in older populations.

I want to give you a very practical coach tip here. When you are working with clients over the age of 70, always check their grip strength. You can use a simple hand dynamometer for this. Grip strength is one of the most powerful predictors of all-cause mortality we have. If your client struggles to open a jar, they are at a very high risk for metabolic and cognitive decline. It is a simple reveal tool that you can use in any setting to get an immediate sense of their physiological resilience.

Now, let us move on to organizing the complexity of these cases. The geriatric client rarely comes to you with just one issue. They usually have what we call multi-morbidity. They are living in multiple nodes of the Functional Medicine Matrix all at once. Your job as the practitioner is to identify the common physiological denominator.

Think about the Assimilation node. We often see hypochlorhydria, which is low stomach acid, and malabsorption. This is frequently driven by declining enzyme production or the chronic overuse of PPIs for acid reflux. Then look at Defense and Repair. We see immunosenescence, which is essentially the aging of the immune system, making them more susceptible to chronic infections. In the Energy node, we see mitochondrial decay and fatigue, often made worse by oxidative stress or medications like statins that deplete CoQ10. And in the Communication node, we see insulin resistance and what I call the thyroid pause, often coupled with chronic stress on the HPA axis.

One of the biggest hurdles we face is polypharmacy. We have to be so vigilant about what we call prescribing cascades. This is where a second drug is prescribed just to treat the side effects of the first one. Imagine a client who takes a statin for cholesterol. That statin causes muscle pain, so the doctor prescribes an NSAID. That NSAID causes GI upset, so they get a prescription for a PPI. Now they have three or four medications for a problem that started with a side effect. Our goal is to organize these interventions and work alongside the client’s physician to simplify their regimen whenever possible.

Next, let us talk about one of the most critical areas of geriatric health: optimizing anabolic drive. Sarcopenia, which is muscle loss, and osteopenia, which is bone loss, are the silent thieves of independence. Without anabolic drive, which is the body’s ability to build and maintain its own tissue, a client enters a state of frailty. And once frailty sets in, the risk of falls and fractures goes through the roof.

There is a major protein paradox in the aging world. The conventional RDA for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. But the research, specifically the PROT-AGE study, suggests that older adults actually need much more. They need between 1.2 and 1.5 grams per kilogram to overcome something called anabolic resistance. As we age, our muscles become less responsive to the signals that tell them to grow. We have to shout louder with our protein intake to get the same result.

But it is not just about the total amount of protein; the timing matters immensely. For your geriatric clients, I recommend a strategy called protein pacing. You want them to aim for 30 to 40 grams of high-quality protein, specifically protein rich in the amino acid Leucine, right at breakfast. This triggers the mTOR pathway early in the day, which stimulates muscle protein synthesis. If they just have tea and toast for breakfast, they are missing a massive opportunity to protect their muscles.

Now, let us turn our attention to the topic that many clients fear the most: neurodegeneration. When we reach the target phase of our work, we have to move beyond a wait-and-see approach. We need to be aggressive about neuro-protection. Dr. Dale Bredesen’s groundbreaking research has shown us that Alzheimer’s is not just one mysterious disease. It is actually a protective response by the brain to three types of insults: inflammation, trophic loss, and toxicity.

To target cognitive decline, we often use what is known as the Keto-Flex 12/3 protocol. This is designed to restore synaptic health in three ways. First, we use mild ketosis. This provides the brain with an alternative fuel source, ketones, which is vital when glucose metabolism in the brain is impaired. Some people even call Alzheimer’s Type 3 Diabetes because of this insulin resistance in the brain.

Second, we use 12/3 fasting. This means a 12-hour overnight fast with at least 3 hours of no food before bed. This promote autophagy, which is the body’s internal cellular cleanup process. It helps clear out those amyloid plaques that we worry about. And third, we focus on increasing Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, or BDNF. Think of BDNF as a fertilizer for the brain. We can boost this through vigorous movement and certain targeted supplements like coffee fruit extract.

I want to share a quick career insight here because I know many of you are thinking about how to build your practice. Think about Diane. She was a 52-year-old former teacher who transitioned into Functional Medicine coaching. She decided to specialize in what she calls aging in place consultations. She created a three-month cognitive resilience package that she charges $2,500 for. Because she is so specialized, she only needs to work with eight clients at a time to earn a six-figure income. But more than the money, she provides this deeply meaningful support to families who are desperate to keep their loved ones vibrant and at home. There is such a need for this kind of specialized care.

As we move into the sustain phase of our work, we have to look at the factors that keep people in the Blue Zones healthy into their hundreds. It is not just about the food or the movement. It is about metabolic flexibility and connection.

Older adults often lose the ability to switch efficiently between burning carbohydrates and burning fats. To sustain health, we need to introduce periodic hormetic stressors. These are small, controlled stresses that make the body stronger. This could be a sauna session, a cold splash at the end of a shower, or intermittent fasting. These practices keep the mitochondria young and resilient.

But we cannot forget the social node of the Matrix. Isolation is literally as lethal as smoking 15 cigarettes a day for the elderly. As a practitioner, you must assess this. Does your client have a sense of purpose, what the Japanese call Ikigai? Do they have a community that counts on them? Without these social anchors, even the best biological interventions will often fail to sustain long-term health. We are social creatures, and that need for connection only intensifies as we age.

Here is another coach tip for you regarding how we talk about these issues. When you are discussing cognitive health with a client, try to avoid the word dementia unless there is a formal diagnosis. Instead, use terms like cognitive vitality or brain optimization. This shifts the entire conversation from a place of fear and inevitability to a place of empowerment and action. It changes the way the client views their own potential.

Let us take a moment to recap some of the big ideas we have covered today. I want you to think through these points as a way to check your understanding.

First, remember that for a geriatric client aiming for true longevity, we are looking for an hs-CRP level of under 1.0 milligrams per liter. Anything higher suggests that inflammaging is active.

Second, think about why we prefer Cystatin C over Creatinine for kidney checks. Remember, it is because muscle loss in the elderly can make creatinine levels look better than they actually are. Cystatin C gives us the real story of renal health.

Third, keep the concept of anabolic resistance in mind. This is why our older clients cannot just get by on the standard protein recommendations. They need that higher dose, up to 1.5 grams per kilogram, to actually signal their muscles to maintain themselves.

And fourth, remember the three insults from the Bredesen Protocol: inflammation, trophic loss, and toxicity. Our job is to identify which of these is the primary driver for our client and target it directly.

As we wrap up, I want to leave you with five key takeaways that should form the foundation of your geriatric practice.

Number one: Inflammaging is the root. Chronic, low-grade inflammation is the primary driver of decline. If you can lower systemic inflammation, you can change the trajectory of aging.

Number two: Protein is non-negotiable. We have to move past the old RDA guidelines. Older adults need significant protein to maintain their muscle mass and their metabolic health.

Number three: Cognitive decline is multi-factorial. We cannot just look for a silver bullet. We have to address insulin resistance, inflammation, and toxicity all at once to truly protect the brain.

Number four: You must manage the prescribing cascade. Always look at the Matrix and ask if a client’s new symptom might actually be a side effect of a medication they are already taking. Work with their doctors to simplify whenever you can.

And number five: Purpose sustains. Social connection and a sense of Ikigai are just as critical as any metabolic marker. A person with a reason to get out of bed in the morning will always have better outcomes than one without.

You are doing such important work by learning these skills. The world needs more practitioners who see the potential for vitality in every stage of life. When we change the way we approach aging, we don't just help people live longer; we help them live better.

Great work today. I am so proud of the dedication you are showing to your craft and your clients. I will see you in the next lesson.
