Hi, it is Sarah here. I am so glad you are joining me for this lesson. We are at a really pivotal point in our training. If you have been following along with the R.O.O.T.S. Method, you know that we have spent a lot of time in the foundational stages. We have talked about nutrition, lifestyle, and the basic financial ethics of the supplement industry. But today, we are stepping into deeper waters. We are talking about the Target phase. This is the part of the process where we move beyond the basics and start looking at high-potency interventions. It is also the phase where your integrity as a practitioner will be tested the most.

In this lesson, I want to help you navigate what I call the innovation gap. This is that space between established, peer-reviewed evidence and the exciting, shiny, yet often unproven therapies that our clients are constantly seeing on social media. You know the ones I am talking about. The latest peptides, the extreme biohacking gadgets, the miracle stem cell treatments. Our goal today is to give you the tools to distinguish between real science and speculative hype. We are going to look at how to market your services without making dangerous claims, how to handle the ethics of the placebo effect, and how to look at research with a critical eye. Most importantly, we are going to talk about your duty of care, which sometimes means having the courage to tell a client no.

Let’s start by talking about the Target phase dilemma. In the R.O.O.T.S. Method, the Target phase is where we apply specific, high-potency interventions to address very specific dysfunctions we have identified in a client. It is a powerful stage, but it is also where the temptation to use cutting-edge but poorly studied therapies is at its highest. You might have a client come to you who is desperate for relief, and they have heard about a new peptide therapy or a specific detox protocol that is trending. As a practitioner, you have to act as a filter. 

In traditional evidence-based practice, we usually talk about three pillars. There is the best available research evidence, there is your own clinical expertise, and then there are the patient’s values. In functional medicine, we add a fourth pillar, which is biochemical individuality. This is the idea that every person’s body responds differently. Now, that fourth pillar is beautiful and it is a core part of what we do, but here is the catch. It is not a get out of jail free card. You cannot use biochemical individuality as an excuse to ignore the first pillar, which is the actual research. 

If you are coming into this field from a background in nursing or teaching, you probably have a high respect for the book, for the established protocols. But in functional medicine, the book is essentially being written in real-time. Science is moving faster than the peer-review process can often keep up with. Your role is to bridge that gap for your client. You have to be able to say to them, look, this protocol has strong mechanistic plausibility. That means it makes sense biologically and it should work in theory. But, you also have to be honest and say that the clinical trials are still small or perhaps only done in animals. You tell them that you will proceed with caution and that you will use objective monitoring to make sure they are safe. That honesty is what separates a professional from a salesperson.

That leads us directly into the topic of ethical marketing. This is where I see so many talented practitioners lose their way. We all want to help people, and we want our businesses to grow, but marketing in the wellness space is currently a bit of a wild west. There was a review of digital health advertising back in 2022 that found something quite shocking. About sixty-four percent of health ads used what we call absolute language. They were using words like guaranteed, cure, or permanent reversal. And in almost every case, there was not nearly enough data to back those claims up.

As a certified functional medicine practitioner, your marketing has to reflect the actual complexity of human biology. We are looking for root-cause resolution, yes, but promising a cure for something as complex as an autoimmune disease or a neurodegenerative condition is not just legally risky, it is ethically unsound. Think about the language you use. Instead of saying you can cure Hashimoto’s in thirty days, try saying that you can support thyroid function and help reduce autoimmune antibodies. That respects the chronic nature of the condition while still offering genuine hope. 

Instead of promising a reversal of Type 2 Diabetes, talk about promoting metabolic flexibility and clinical remission. That word remission is so important. It acknowledges that the underlying genetic susceptibility is still there, even if the symptoms are gone. And instead of offering guaranteed weight loss, talk about addressing the biological barriers to weight management. This acknowledges that every person’s biology and compliance level is different. You are still offering a premium service, but you are doing it with integrity.

I want to share a story with you that illustrates this perfectly. I worked with a practitioner named Sarah a while back. She was a former nurse who had transitioned into functional coaching. She had a client named Deborah, who was in her mid-fifties and struggling with really bad joint pain and brain fog. Deborah came into a session one day very excited because she had seen a social media influencer claiming that a specific peptide called BPC-157 had cured their arthritis overnight. Deborah wanted it immediately. 

Now, Sarah knew that BPC-157 has some very promising animal data, but she also knew that human clinical trials are incredibly sparse. She also knew that the legal status of recommending peptides as a non-physician is a very grey area. Instead of just giving in to the client’s demand, Sarah took the time to explain the difference between mechanistic plausibility and actual clinical evidence. She redirected Deborah back to the foundational work we do in the Optimize phase. They focused on anti-inflammatory nutrition and gut health. Sarah documented the request and her refusal, noting that there was insufficient safety data for Deborah’s specific profile. 

The outcome was incredible. Deborah’s pain actually decreased by about forty percent just through the foundational work alone. She ended up thanking Sarah for protecting her from the hype and for not letting her waste money on something that might not have been safe or necessary. That is what clinical integrity looks like in practice.

Now, let's talk about something a bit more subtle, the placebo effect. In conventional medicine, the placebo effect is often treated like a nuisance. It is something researchers try to control for or get rid of in a study. But in functional medicine, we look at it differently. We see it as the healing response. It is the body’s innate ability to shift into a restorative, parasympathetic state based on belief and the strength of the therapeutic relationship.

There is a real ethical line here, though. It is perfectly ethical to use the power of expectation to enhance a treatment that you know works. If you are giving a client magnesium and you say, this is going to help your nervous system relax, you are using the healing response to boost a proven therapy. But it becomes deceptive if you are selling an inert or unproven therapy simply because you think the client’s belief will make them feel better. 

The key is transparency. You can be honest about the mechanism. You can tell a client that the science shows a specific nutrient supports mitochondrial pathways, and then add that their positive mindset about the protocol will actually help their body absorb and utilize it better. You are leveraging the placebo effect without lying about what the intervention actually does. You are building trust, not performing a magic trick.

To maintain your status as a premium practitioner, you have to be able to appraise evidence. Not all research is created equal. You will often see studies that are funded by supplement companies. These often have what we call publication bias, where the company might suppress negative results and only publish the positive ones. You also have to be careful with N-of-one clinical experience. We all have those stories where a specific protocol worked wonders for one client, but that is the lowest form of evidence. It should never override actual safety data.

Even in functional medicine, the gold standard remains meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials. There was a very interesting meta-analysis in 2023 that looked at over eight thousand participants across forty-two studies. It found that practitioners who were explicitly honest about the limitations of research actually had twenty-two percent higher client retention rates. Think about that. Clients don't actually want you to be a superhero who has all the answers. They value honesty over certainty. When you tell a client, here is what the research says, and here is where the research is still thin, you are treating them like a partner in their own health. That builds a level of loyalty that marketing hype never could.

This brings us to perhaps the hardest part of being an ethical coach, the duty of care and the power of saying no. Sometimes, a client will be absolutely convinced that an unproven therapy is their only hope. This is especially dangerous when they want to replace a life-saving conventional treatment, like chemotherapy or insulin, with an alternative therapy. 

As a certified functional medicine practitioner, our standard is very clear. We do not replace; we integrate. If a therapy has a high risk of harm or a high opportunity cost, you have a professional duty to advise against it. Opportunity cost is a term we use to describe what a client is giving up by choosing one path over another. If they spend all their time and money on an unproven detox protocol instead of getting a necessary medical screening, that is a massive opportunity cost.

When you are trying to decide whether to support a client’s interest in a new therapy, I want you to use what I call the Safety-Efficacy Matrix. Think of it like a grid. If a therapy is low in efficacy but high in safety, like a mild herbal tea, you can be flexible. It might not do much, but it won’t hurt them. However, if a therapy is low in efficacy and low in safety, like some of those unregulated detox injections you see online, you must be firm. You have to discourage it. Your job is to be the scientific filter that protects your client from the noise of the wellness industry.

Let’s take a moment to check your understanding of these concepts. I want you to really think about these questions. If a client brought you a study funded by a supplement company that claimed their product was one hundred percent effective for insomnia, how would you handle that? Think about the bias we discussed. You would need to look at who funded the study and whether the results seem too good to be true. You would explain to the client that while the results are interesting, we need to look for independent research to confirm them.

What about that term opportunity cost? Can you define it in your own words? It is really about the hidden price of a choice. If a client chooses an unproven alternative over a proven conventional treatment, the cost isn't just the money they spent; it is the health they might lose by delaying proper care.

Is it ethical to use the placebo effect? Yes, but only when it is used to enhance a legitimate treatment and when you are transparent with the client. And finally, why is the term remission often better than the word cure? It is because remission acknowledges the complexity of chronic disease. It is more honest about the fact that we are managing a biological system, not just fixing a broken part.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, remember that evidence-based practice is a balance. It requires research, your clinical experience, the client’s values, and their biochemical individuality. Second, be extra careful during the Target phase. This is when the most experimental therapies tend to crop up, and it is where you need to be most vigilant. 

Third, keep your marketing honest. Use cautious, supportive language. Avoid those absolute claims of curing disease. It will protect you legally and it will build more trust with the right kind of clients. Fourth, remember your duty to act as a scientific filter. You are the one who stands between your client and the often-predatory world of marketing science. And lastly, always choose transparency. Being honest about what we don't know is actually a sign of expertise, not a sign of weakness.

You are doing the hard work of becoming a truly elite practitioner. It is not just about knowing which supplements to recommend; it is about having the ethical framework to use that knowledge wisely. I am very proud of the progress you are making. Take some time to reflect on how you can apply these ethical standards to your own practice starting today. I will see you in the next lesson. Great work.
