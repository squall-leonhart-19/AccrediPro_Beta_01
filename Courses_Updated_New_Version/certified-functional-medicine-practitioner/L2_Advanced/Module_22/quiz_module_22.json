            "question": "A Functional Medicine practitioner notices a suspicious mole during a physical exam. Which action best reflects the 'Professional Scope' boundaries discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnose the mole as basal cell carcinoma based on visual markers.",
                "Perform a punch biopsy in the office to save the client time.",
                "Document the finding and refer the client to a board-certified dermatologist for diagnosis.",
                "Tell the client it is likely nothing to worry about but to monitor it for changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional Medicine practitioners must operate within their legal scope of practice; diagnosing skin malignancies typically requires specific licensure and dermatological expertise, making a referral the ethically and legally sound choice."

                "GINA does not apply to life, disability, or long-term care insurance.",
                "GINA only applies to individuals with pre-existing symptomatic conditions.",
                "GINA prevents employers from seeing any genetic data, regardless of company size."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While GINA protects against discrimination in health insurance and employment, it does not extend to life, disability, or long-term care insurance, which is a vital component of informed consent in Lesson 2."

                "Require all clients to purchase supplements directly from the clinic to ensure quality control.",
                "Disclose the financial interest in the supplements and provide the client with the option to purchase elsewhere.",
                "Bundle supplement costs into the initial consultation fee so the markup is not visible.",
                "Only recommend supplements that the practitioner does not profit from, even if they are lower quality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transparency is key to financial integrity. Practitioners should disclose their profit interest and ensure patients know they are free to source equivalent products elsewhere without it affecting their care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-maleficence requires practitioners to prioritize safety. Using unvalidated therapies without a clear evidence base or safety profile risks harm to the patient."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shared decision-making levels the power dynamic by treating the patient as an expert in their own life and the practitioner as an expert in clinical science, merging the two for better adherence and outcomes."
