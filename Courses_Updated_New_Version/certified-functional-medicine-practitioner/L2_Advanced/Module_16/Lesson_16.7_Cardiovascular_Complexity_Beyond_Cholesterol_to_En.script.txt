Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here with me today. In this lesson, we are going to dive into what I consider one of the most important shifts in functional medicine. We are moving beyond the standard lipid panel and stepping into a much more sophisticated way of looking at the heart. We’re moving from a focus on just the cholesterol molecules to focusing on the health of the vessels themselves. 

If you’ve been following along in the curriculum, you know we just finished Module 8, where we talked all about energy and oxidative stress. We looked at how the mitochondria power every cell in the body. Today, we are going to apply those exact mitochondrial principles to the vascular system. We’re going to see how oxidative damage in the endothelium—that tiny, delicate lining of your arteries—is actually what drives the cardiovascular diseases we discussed back in Level 1.

For decades, the conversation around heart health has been dominated by one single molecule: cholesterol. We’ve been told that LDL is the bad guy and that lowering it is the only goal. But while LDL certainly matters, it is only one piece of a much larger and much more complex puzzle. In this lesson, we are going to move way beyond the lipid panel. We’re going to explore the endothelium. This is a single-cell layer that lines your blood vessels. I like to think of it as the brain of the cardiovascular system because it’s constantly sensing blood flow and making decisions. 

By the time we finish today, you’re going to know how to identify vascular fire before it ever becomes a clinical event. You’ll also feel confident supporting those clients who simply cannot or will not use traditional statin therapy. We have a lot to cover, so let’s look at our objectives for this session.

First, we are going to analyze the role of two very important markers: Myeloperoxidase, or MPO, and Lp-PLA2. These are the markers that help us predict the risk of a plaque rupture. Next, we’ll evaluate the clinical significance of Lipoprotein(a) and the Coronary Artery Calcium Score, or CAC. These are vital for our high-risk patients. Then, I’ll show you how to design a targeted protocol for endothelial health using things like Bergamot, Red Yeast Rice, and Nitric Oxide precursors. 

We’re also going to look at how to implement the R.O.O.T.S. Method for long-term cardiovascular monitoring. This includes using CIMT tracking, which is a game-changer for seeing real-time changes in the arteries. Finally, I’m going to explain the function of the glycocalyx. This is your arterial armor. We’ll talk about how to protect it using dietary nitrates.

Let’s start with a major paradigm shift. In conventional medicine, LDL-cholesterol is often treated as the ultimate villain. But in functional medicine, we use a different lens. Think of it this way: LDL is just a passenger in a car. The car itself is the lipoprotein, and the road is the endothelium. Now, if the road is smooth and well-maintained, that passenger reaches their destination safely without any trouble. 

However, if that road is full of potholes—things like oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction—that’s when the passenger crashes. They crash right into the arterial wall. That crash is what initiates the formation of plaque. This is why the state of the road is actually more important than the number of passengers.

Here is a staggering statistic that I want you to really sit with. Research shows that 50% of people who have heart attacks actually have normal cholesterol levels. Let that sink in for a moment. Half of the people experiencing these life-altering events wouldn't have been flagged on a standard screening. This data proves that looking at cholesterol alone is simply insufficient. We have to look at the environment in which those lipids are circulating.

When you’re explaining this to your clients, I highly recommend using that pothole analogy. It’s so effective because it shifts their fear away from a scary number on a lab test. Instead, it gives them an empowered action plan. They realize they can focus on fixing the road. This builds immediate rapport and trust. It’s especially helpful for clients who feel frustrated because they’ve been doing everything right but their standard numbers aren't moving the way their doctor wants.

Now, let’s move into the Reveal phase. To truly find the root cause of cardiovascular risk, we need to use advanced biomarkers. I often use the Cleveland HeartLab for this because they offer what I call a vascular inflammatory bridge. These tests tell us if there is an active fire burning in the arteries right now.

The first marker is Myeloperoxidase, or MPO. This measures white blood cell activation inside the artery wall. When MPO is elevated, it tells us that there is vulnerable plaque present. This is plaque that is at high risk of rupturing. It’s like a warning light on a dashboard telling you that the system is unstable.

Then we have Lp-PLA2, also known as the PLAC test. This is an enzyme that indicates vascular-specific inflammation. It’s a very specific marker for the fire inside the arterial wall itself. If MPO is the smoke, Lp-PLA2 is often the flame.

We also have to talk about Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). This is a genetic particle. It’s a highly inflammatory type of LDL particle that is particularly sticky. The tricky thing about Lp(a) is that it doesn’t usually respond to traditional diet or even statin therapy. Knowing if a client has this genetic risk is vital because it changes our entire strategy.

Finally, we look at Oxidized LDL. This is LDL that has been damaged by free radicals. This is a crucial distinction because regular LDL isn't necessarily a problem, but oxidized LDL is. In fact, it’s the only form of LDL that actually initiates the plaque process. If we can stop the oxidation, we can often stop the progression of the disease.

While blood work shows us the risk, we also need to see the actual burden. That’s where the Coronary Artery Calcium Score, or CAC, comes in. I tell my clients this is like a mammogram for the heart. It’s a quick CT scan that measures the amount of calcified, or hard, plaque in the coronary arteries. For many clients in their 40s and 50s, our goal is a score of zero. If we see a score above 100, that indicates significant subclinical atherosclerosis. That’s a sign that we need to be very aggressive with our root-cause interventions.

Now, I want to introduce you to something called the glycocalyx. This is a fascinating area of research. The endothelium is covered by a delicate, gel-like layer called the glycocalyx. Think of this as the non-stick coating on a frying pan. When that coating is healthy and thick, everything—cholesterol, platelets, white blood cells—just slides right past the arterial wall. Nothing sticks.

But when that glycocalyx is damaged, the pan becomes sticky. Things like high blood sugar, smoking, or chronic stress act like a metal spatula scraping away that non-stick coating. Once it’s gone, plaque begins to accumulate. 

The good news is that we can protect and even help restore this layer. Dietary nitrates are a huge part of this. Foods like arugula, beets, and spinach provide the raw materials for Nitric Oxide production, which supports the glycocalyx. There is also emerging research suggesting that glucosamine and chondroitin—supplements we usually think of for joints—may support the structural integrity of this layer. And specifically, seaweed extracts, like rhamnan sulfate from green seaweed, have been shown to help regrow the glycocalyx.

I want to pause here for a moment and give you a tip on the business side of things. Practitioners who specialize in cardiovascular longevity often command premium rates. This is because you are addressing the number one cause of mortality with high-level data and deeply personalized care. A six-month Vascular Vitality program can easily be priced between $3,500 and $5,000. When you can show a client their vascular fire markers and then show them those markers improving, the value of your work is undeniable.

Let’s look at how this plays out in real life with a case study. I want to tell you about Brenda. She was 54 years old, a high-level executive with a very high-stress career. She was also post-menopausal. Brenda came to me because she was statin-intolerant. She had tried three different statins, and every single one caused her severe muscle aches, or myalgia. 

Her LDL was 185, which is high, but her Calcium Score was the real concern—it was 240. That put her in the high-risk category. Brenda was absolutely terrified of having a heart attack, but she felt trapped because she couldn't tolerate the medication her doctor prescribed.

In the Reveal phase, we ran her advanced markers. Her Lp(a) was 145, which is highly elevated. This told us she had a significant genetic risk. Her MPO was also high at 520, indicating active vascular inflammation. We also saw that her homocysteine was 14.2, which meant she needed some serious B-vitamin support.

So, we designed a targeted intervention for her. We started her on Red Yeast Rice at 1,200 milligrams daily. This acts as a natural inhibitor of the enzyme that produces cholesterol. To prevent any muscle aches, we paired it with 200 milligrams of CoQ10 in the ubiquinol form. We also added Bergamot BPF at 1,000 milligrams a day. Bergamot is incredible because it improves HDL function and lowers LDL at the same time. Finally, we added 3 grams of L-Citrulline daily to boost her Nitric Oxide levels and support her endothelium.

The outcomes were fantastic. After four months, Brenda’s LDL dropped to 112. But more importantly, her MPO—that vascular fire marker—dropped into the green range, below 400. And the best part? She had zero muscle pain. She felt empowered. She wasn't a victim of her genetics anymore because she had a plan that actually worked for her body.

When statins aren't an option, or when we want to enhance the therapy a client is already on, we look to the Big Three of functional cardiovascular support.

First is Bergamot. This is a citrus fruit from Italy that contains unique polyphenols. It doesn't just lower LDL; it actually changes the particle size, making the particles larger and less likely to get stuck in the arterial wall.

Second is Red Yeast Rice. This contains monacolin K, which is chemically similar to some statins but often much better tolerated when used as a whole-food extract. However, you must remember this: Red Yeast Rice can deplete CoQ10 just like a statin does. You should always pair it with CoQ10 to protect mitochondrial function and prevent muscle pain.

Third is Nitric Oxide support. As we age, our ability to produce Nitric Oxide drops significantly. By age 40, most people have lost about 50% of their NO production. Using L-Citrulline or concentrated beet crystals can restore that vasodilation, which lowers blood pressure and protects the endothelium.

I have a quick coach tip for you here regarding those inflammatory markers. If you have a client with an unexplained high MPO that just won't come down despite a perfect diet and supplements, check for mold and mycotoxins. We’ll cover this more in Module 16, but for now, just know that mycotoxins are potent vascular irritants. They can keep the fire burning in the arteries even when you’re doing everything else right.

Finally, let’s talk about the R.O.O.T.S. Sustain Plan. Cardiovascular health is not a one-and-done intervention. It requires long-term, objective monitoring. In the Sustain phase, we move beyond the Calcium Score. The reason for this is that a CAC score measures old scars—it measures calcified plaque that has already been there for a long time.

To see what’s happening right now, we use the CIMT, or Carotid Intima-Media Thickness test. This is an ultrasound that measures the thickness of the carotid artery wall. Unlike the CAC, which only sees hard plaque, the CIMT can see soft plaque. Soft plaque is actually the most dangerous kind because it’s the type that is prone to rupture and cause an event. 

By tracking the CIMT every 12 to 18 months, we can see if our lifestyle and supplement interventions are actually regressing the plaque thickness. This gives the client incredible peace of mind. They can see the physical evidence that their hard work is paying off.

Let’s wrap up by checking your understanding of these concepts. Think about these questions for a moment.

First, why is a normal LDL level sometimes misleading when we’re assessing cardiovascular risk?
The answer is that half of all heart attack patients have normal LDL. This is because the health of the endothelium and the presence of inflammation are often more important than the number of particles alone.

Second, what is the primary function of the glycocalyx in the arteries?
It acts like a non-stick coating. It prevents cholesterol and inflammatory cells from sticking to the arterial wall and forming plaque.

Third, which biomarker specifically indicates that plaque is vulnerable or at risk of rupturing?
That would be Myeloperoxidase, or MPO. It’s our primary marker for plaque instability.

And fourth, why must Red Yeast Rice always be paired with CoQ10?
Because Red Yeast Rice inhibits the same pathway that produces CoQ10. Without supplementation, the client may experience muscle pain and mitochondrial dysfunction.

As we close out today, I want to leave you with these key takeaways. Always remember: Endothelium first. The health of the arterial lining and its glycocalyx is more predictive of heart events than cholesterol alone. Use advanced lab testing like MPO and Lp-PLA2 to reveal active vascular inflammation. 

If a client is statin-intolerant, Bergamot and Red Yeast Rice are powerful options, provided you manage them with CoQ10. Never forget that Nitric Oxide is critical. Support that arterial elasticity with dietary nitrates like arugula and beets. And finally, use CIMT tracking in the Sustain phase to objectively measure whether plaque is regressing or progressing.

You are doing amazing work. By moving into this advanced cardiovascular model, you are providing a level of care that can truly save lives. You’re giving your clients a clear map and the tools to fix the road, not just manage the passengers.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
