Hi, it’s Sarah. It is so good to have you here for Lesson 6. Today, we are shifting our focus in a very significant way. In our last lesson, we navigated the intricate and often delicate world of pediatric complexity. We looked at how early interventions can change the entire trajectory of a child’s life. But now, we are pivoting to the opposite end of the lifespan. We are going to apply the R.O.O.T.S. Method™ to a demographic that is growing faster than almost any other in the functional medicine space: the Aging Athlete.

When I talk about the aging athlete, I’m not just talking about people running marathons in their seventies, although they certainly count. I’m talking about any individual over the age of fifty who wants to maintain their independence, their strength, and their metabolic health. In this stage of life, structural integrity becomes the primary determinant of long-term healthspan. If the frame of the house starts to crumble, it doesn’t matter how nice the wallpaper is. This is where muscle and bone become our most valuable assets.

You are going to encounter clients in your practice who seem to be doing everything right. They eat clean, they stay active, they take their vitamins, and yet, they are still losing strength. They feel more fragile. They notice their clothes fitting differently because their muscle is being replaced by fat, even if the scale hasn’t moved. This is what we call the anabolic pivot. As a Functional Medicine Practitioner, your job is to identify why their body is no longer responding to the signals of growth and repair. We call this phenomenon anabolic resistance, and today, I’m going to teach you how to reverse that trajectory.

By the time we finish this lesson, you’ll be able to analyze the pathophysiology of sarcopenia and osteoporosis as metabolic dysfunctions rather than just inevitable parts of aging. You’ll know how to interpret DEXA scans and serum biomarkers like IGF-1 and Free Testosterone to quantify exactly how much musculoskeletal decay is happening. We’ll design targeted protocols using tools like Creatine, Collagen, and Vitamin K2. Most importantly, you’ll learn how to implement protein pacing and periodized resistance training to overcome that stubborn anabolic resistance. We’ll also look at grip strength and DNA methylation clocks as objective markers to make sure our interventions are actually working.

Let’s start by looking at the musculoskeletal crisis. In conventional medicine, sarcopenia, which is the clinical term for muscle loss, and osteoporosis, which is bone loss, are often treated as if they are just what happens when the calendar turns. It’s viewed as a slow, inevitable decline. But in functional medicine, we see it differently. We view these conditions as metabolic failures of structural remodeling. Your body is constantly breaking down and rebuilding itself. When the breakdown outpaces the rebuilding, we have a crisis.

Muscle is so much more than just a way to move from point A to point B. I want you to start thinking of muscle as the body’s largest endocrine organ. It secretes signaling molecules called myokines that communicate with the brain, the liver, and the gut. It’s also the primary site for glucose disposal. When you lose muscle, you lose your metabolic sink. This is why muscle loss is so closely tied to insulin resistance and systemic inflammation.

The data on this is quite sobering. A major meta-analysis published in The Lancet recently showed that after the age of forty, most people lose about eight percent of their muscle mass every single decade. Once they hit seventy, that rate nearly doubles to fifteen percent. This isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about survival. This loss is strongly correlated with something we call inflamm-aging—that chronic, low-grade inflammation that drives almost every degenerative disease we know of.

I want to tell you about a student of ours named Elena to give you an idea of how this looks in the real world. Elena was a nurse for over twenty years before she joined our academy. She saw firsthand how the loss of mobility was the beginning of the end for so many of her patients. When she started her own functional medicine practice, she decided to focus specifically on what she called Post-Menopausal Vitality. She realized that women in their fifties and sixties were a vastly underserved market.

Elena doesn’t just sell "wellness." She runs twelve-week musculoskeletal intensives, and she charges $3,500 for the program. Why? Because she provides a result that is priceless: the ability to stay strong and independent. She tells her clients that muscle is longevity currency. The more of it you have in the bank, the more metabolic mistakes you can afford to make. If you have a high muscle mass, your body can handle a high-carb meal or a period of stress much better than someone who is sarcopenic. Elena’s success shows that when you solve a high-stakes problem like frailty, the market responds.

Now, let’s look at a case study to see how we apply the R.O.O.T.S. Method™ in a clinical setting. Let’s talk about Robert. Robert is sixty-two years old, and he’s been a runner his entire life. But lately, he’s been struggling. He came in complaining of frailty and chronic back pain. He told me, Sarah, I’m just aching all the time. He had stopped running and started walking because his joints couldn’t take the impact anymore.

On paper, Robert looked fine. His BMI was in the healthy range. But when you looked closer, you could see the changes. He had developed that "skinny-fat" look—thinner limbs but an increase in abdominal fat. He had even lost an inch and a half in height over the last five years. That’s a huge red flag for bone density loss in the spine.

When we moved into the Reveal phase of our framework, we ran some specific tests. His DEXA scan showed a T-score of minus 1.8. Now, for context, anything below minus 1.0 is considered osteopenia. He wasn’t at full-blown osteoporosis yet, but he was on the doorstep. His Appendicular Lean Mass, which is the muscle in his arms and legs, was also very low.

Then we looked at his bloodwork. His serum IGF-1 was only 88 nanograms per milliliter. That put him in the bottom ten percent for his age group. IGF-1 is our primary marker for anabolic drive—it’s the signal that tells the body to grow and repair. His Free Testosterone was also clinically low at 5.2. To top it off, his high-sensitivity CRP was 3.2, which told us he was dealing with chronic low-grade inflammation. Robert wasn’t just "getting old." His body had lost the signal to maintain its own structure.

To help clients like Robert, we have to move beyond general advice. We need to organize our findings under the Structural Integrity and Hormonal Signaling nodes of the Functional Medicine Matrix. We look at IGF-1 not just to see if it’s in the lab range, but to see if it’s optimal. For an aging athlete, we want to see that IGF-1 between 125 and 175. If it’s lower, the body simply doesn’t have the "construction workers" it needs to repair tissue.

We also look closely at the DEXA T-score. A score of zero means your bones are as dense as a healthy thirty-year-old. We want our clients as close to that zero as possible. Then there’s Vitamin D. Most labs say thirty is fine, but for bone health and muscle protein synthesis, we really want to see that between fifty and eighty. And finally, we use grip strength. I cannot emphasize this enough: buy a handgrip dynamometer. It is a validated proxy for whole-body strength and a powerful predictor of mortality. If a client’s grip strength is declining, their healthspan is declining.

Once we’ve identified these gaps, we move into the Target phase. We aren't just throwing supplements at the problem; we are providing the specific raw materials and signaling molecules the body needs to rebuild.

The first tool in our toolkit is Creatine Monohydrate. Now, I know what you’re thinking—isn’t that for bodybuilders? Yes, but it is perhaps the most researched and safe ergogenic aid in history, and it is a godsend for the aging athlete. In older adults, creatine does two things. First, it increases the stores of phosphocreatine, which helps with short bursts of power—like getting out of a chair or catching your balance if you trip. Second, it has an osmotic effect, drawing water into the muscle cells, which actually triggers the signaling for new muscle growth. There’s even evidence now that when you combine creatine with resistance training, it improves bone mineral density more than exercise alone.

Next, we look at Collagen Peptides and Vitamin C. Did you know that bone is about thirty-five percent collagen? Most people think of bone as just a stick of calcium, but it’s actually a flexible collagen matrix reinforced with minerals. Here is a specific clinical pearl for you: have your clients take fifteen to twenty grams of collagen peptides about forty-five to sixty minutes before they exercise. Research shows that this specific timing doubles the rate of collagen synthesis in the connective tissues. We are literally "feeding" the joints right before we load them.

Then we have Vitamin K2, specifically the MK-7 form. Think of Vitamin D as the person who lets calcium into the house, but Vitamin K2 is the person who tells the calcium which room to go to. Without K2, calcium can end up in the soft tissues, like your arteries, which causes calcification. K2 activates a protein called osteocalcin, which ushers that calcium directly into the bone matrix where it belongs.

I want to give you a very important coach tip here. Always check for hypochlorhydria, which is low stomach acid, in your aging clients. As we get older, our production of stomach acid often declines. If a client can’t break down their protein into amino acids, or if they can’t ionize minerals like calcium and magnesium because their stomach pH is too high, it doesn’t matter how many supplements they take. They’ll just end up with what I call "expensive urine." We have to ensure the digestive fire is lit so they can actually use the nutrients we’re giving them.

Now, let’s talk about the most critical piece of the puzzle: overcoming anabolic resistance. This is the biological "numbness" that happens to aging muscle. When you’re twenty-five, you can eat a small yogurt with fifteen grams of protein and your muscles will respond by building new tissue. But when you’re sixty, that same fifteen grams does absolutely nothing. The "switch" doesn't flip.

That switch is a protein called mTOR, which stands for mammalian target of rapamycin. To flip the mTOR switch in an older adult, we need a higher concentration of a specific amino acid called leucine. We call this the leucine threshold. Most aging athletes need about three to three and a half grams of leucine in a single sitting to trigger muscle protein synthesis.

This is why we implement a strategy called Protein Pacing. We aren't just looking at total protein for the day; we are looking at how it’s distributed. We want our clients getting between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the key is the dose. They need at least thirty to forty grams of high-quality protein at every meal, three to four times a day. If they eat twenty grams here and ten grams there, they never hit that leucine threshold, and their muscles stay in a catabolic, or breaking-down, state.

I also recommend a pre-sleep protein dose. Having twenty to thirty grams of a slow-digesting protein like casein or a high-quality blend before bed can prevent what we call nocturnal catabolism. It keeps the body in a building state even while they sleep.

Of course, nutrition is only half the battle. You have to give the body a reason to keep its muscle and bone. This is why I tell my clients that resistance training is a non-negotiable medical prescription. It is the only way to signal the osteoblasts—the bone-building cells—to increase density. Walking is wonderful for the heart and for mental health, but let’s be clear: walking does very little for the bone density of your hips and spine compared to lifting heavy objects. We need mechanical loading to maintain structural integrity.

The final phase of our R.O.O.T.S. framework is Sustain. How do we know if these interventions are actually working? We have to look beyond the scale. We look at markers of biological resilience. One of the most exciting areas of research right now is DNA methylation clocks, like the GrimAge or the DunedinPACE. These tests can actually quantify how fast a person is aging at a cellular level. And guess what? Musculoskeletal health is one of the strongest modifiers of these clocks. When you improve a client’s muscle mass and bone density, you are quite literally slowing down their biological clock.

We also continue to monitor the ALM-to-height ratio through annual DEXA scans. This ensures that if a client is losing weight, they are losing fat, not the precious muscle we worked so hard to build. And we keep using that grip strength dynamometer. It’s our canary in the coal mine. If grip strength starts to dip, we know we need to adjust the protocol before a more serious decline happens.

I want to remind you that your success as a practitioner often comes down to the community you surround yourself with. When you join a program like ours, you aren’t just getting a certificate. You’re joining a network of experts who are all working on these same challenges. We share longevity protocols, we discuss complex cases, and we provide the business templates you need to succeed. You don't have to figure this out alone. You can move straight from being a student to being an expert in one of the highest-paying and most rewarding niches in functional medicine.

Before we wrap up, let’s do a quick mental check of what we’ve covered. Think about why a fifteen-gram protein snack just isn’t enough for your sixty-five-year-old clients. Remember that leucine threshold—we need that thirty to forty-gram "pulse" of protein to flip the mTOR switch. Think about the role of Vitamin K2 as the "traffic cop" for calcium. And remember how to time that collagen supplement—forty-five minutes before the workout to maximize the benefit to the joints.

If you take away nothing else from today, remember these five points. First, muscle is medicine. Sarcopenia is a metabolic emergency that drives inflammation and insulin resistance. Second, bone health requires more than just calcium. You need Vitamin D, K2, collagen, and most importantly, mechanical loading. Third, you must use protein pacing to overcome anabolic resistance. Aim for that thirty-plus grams per meal. Fourth, use objective monitoring. Don't guess—test. Use DEXA, IGF-1, and grip strength to track your progress. And finally, recognize the opportunity. The fifty-plus demographic is looking for someone with your expertise to help them stay strong and vibrant.

You are doing incredible work by mastering these concepts. You are learning how to give people back their future. Great work today. I’m so proud of the progress you’re making. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
