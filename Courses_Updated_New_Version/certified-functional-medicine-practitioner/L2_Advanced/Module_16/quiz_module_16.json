            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the Autoimmune-Gut-Brain axis case study, which biomarker is considered the 'gold standard' for identifying a breakdown in the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Zonulin",
                "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)",
                "S100B Protein",
                "Calprotectin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While zonulin indicates intestinal permeability, S100B is a calcium-binding protein found in glial cells; its presence in the blood is a specific marker for BBB leakage and neuroinflammation."

        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "Regarding 'Type 3 Diabetes' (Neurodegeneration), what is the primary consequence of Insulin Degrading Enzyme (IDE) being diverted to manage peripheral hyperinsulinemia?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of glutathione",
                "Reduced clearance of Amyloid-beta plaques in the brain",
                "Rapid weight loss and muscle wasting",
                "Upregulation of GLUT4 transporters in neurons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IDE is responsible for breaking down both insulin and amyloid-beta. When insulin levels are chronically high, IDE is 'monopolized' by insulin, allowing amyloid-beta to accumulate in the brain."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the 'Lean PCOS' case study, what is often the primary driver of hyperandrogenism compared to the classic 'Insulin-Resistant PCOS' phenotype?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive intake of refined carbohydrates",
                "HPA-axis dysregulation leading to adrenal androgen (DHEA-S) overproduction",
                "Low levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Thyroid peroxidase antibodies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lean PCOS patients often present with normal insulin sensitivity but high adrenal androgens driven by HPA-axis activation and stress, rather than the insulin-driven ovarian androgen production seen in obese phenotypes."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A patient presenting with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) from mold exposure typically shows which characteristic hormonal finding on a LabCorp/Quest panel?",

                "Low TGF-beta1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low MSH is a hallmark of CIRS. It leads to sleep disturbances, chronic pain (reduced endorphins), and increased mucosal permeability (leaky gut/leaky lungs)."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "The 'Molecular Mimicry' mechanism in PANS/PANDAS involves the immune system mistakenly attacking which part of the pediatric brain?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In PANS/PANDAS, antibodies produced against an infection (like Strep) cross-react with dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia, leading to the sudden onset of OCD and tics."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "To overcome 'Anabolic Resistance' in the aging athlete (Lesson 6), what is the specific 'Leucine Threshold' required per meal to stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",

                "5.0 - 7.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aging muscle requires a higher concentration of the amino acid leucine (approx. 2.5-3g) to trigger the mTOR pathway and initiate muscle repair, compared to younger individuals who require less."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "When addressing 'Cardiovascular Complexity,' which marker is an early indicator of endothelial dysfunction by acting as a competitive inhibitor of Nitric Oxide (NO) production?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ADMA competes with L-arginine for the Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) enzyme. High ADMA levels lead to low NO, causing vasoconstriction and endothelial stiffness regardless of cholesterol levels."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the R.O.O.T.S. Capstone Method, what does the 'T' represent in the clinical hierarchy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'T' in R.O.O.T.S. stands for Triggers & Toxins, emphasizing the need to identify and remove the external or internal factors (mold, metals, pathogens) driving the pathology."

            "options": [
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Benfotiamine (Lipid-soluble B1)",
                "Omega-3 Fatty Acids",
                "Calcium Citrate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Benfotiamine activates the enzyme transketolase, which redirects glucose metabolites away from the toxic polyol and AGE-forming pathways (like methylglyoxal production)."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "According to the Multi-System Case Study approach, what is the 'Order of Operations' when treating a patient with both high toxic burden and severe gut dysbiosis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, you must 'open the drain' (drainage pathways like liver/bile/bowels) before mobilizing toxins or killing pathogens to prevent a severe Herxheimer or re-circulation reaction."
