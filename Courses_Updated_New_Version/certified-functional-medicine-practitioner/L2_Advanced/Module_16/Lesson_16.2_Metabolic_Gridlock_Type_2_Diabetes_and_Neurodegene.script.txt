Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. It is so good to have you back here for our second lesson. In our last session, we spent a lot of time looking at the Autoimmune-Gut-Brain Axis. We talked about how the health of the microbiome and the integrity of the intestinal wall set the stage for neuroinflammation. Today, we are going to pivot. We’re moving into what I call the Energy Node. This is where we examine how systemic metabolic health—specifically insulin resistance—creates a state of gridlock in the brain. You might have heard this referred to as Type 3 Diabetes. It is one of the most critical concepts you will master in this certification.

As the population ages, we are seeing a clinical epidemic of cognitive decline. But here is the thing. Much of this decline isn’t just about getting older. It is about a fuel crisis. In this lesson, I’m going to take you beyond simple blood sugar management. We are going to explore how you can restore metabolic flexibility to the brain. This is how you help your clients reclaim their cognitive edge and potentially reverse the early stages of neurodegeneration.

I want to start by laying out what we are going to achieve together today. First, we are going to analyze the pathophysiology of Type 3 Diabetes. I want you to understand exactly how this leads to hippocampal atrophy. Second, we will look at how to interpret advanced metabolic markers. We’re going beyond the standard HbA1c. We’ll talk about HOMA-IR and GlycoMark for early detection. Third, we’ll evaluate dietary interventions. We will compare the clinical efficacy of Ketogenic protocols versus the Mediterranean-DASH approach. Fourth, I’ll show you how to design a targeted mitochondrial protocol. We will look at PQQ, CoQ10, and Alpha-Lipoic Acid. Finally, we’ll discuss how to implement continuous glucose monitoring as a behavioral tool for your clients.

Let’s start with a story. I want to tell you about a client named Susan. Susan came to me when she was in her early fifties. She had a very successful career as a school administrator, but she felt her edge slipping. She was experiencing what she called "mental fog." She would walk into a meeting and lose her train of thought. She was forgetting names of staff members she had known for years. Susan was terrified because she had a family history of Alzheimer’s. She had seen what that disease did to her mother, and she was convinced she was next.

Susan had already seen her conventional doctor. They ran a standard physical and told her she was "fine." Her HbA1c was 5.8%. In the conventional world, that’s just pre-diabetic. Her doctor told her to watch her carbs and come back in a year. But Susan didn’t feel fine. She felt like her brain was failing her. Through our R.O.O.T.S. Method, we uncovered a different story. Susan’s brain was essentially starving in a sea of plenty. She had systemic insulin resistance that had created a metabolic gridlock in her hippocampus. This is the area of the brain responsible for memory and learning. We had to fix her fuel delivery system before we could fix her memory.

Now, let’s talk about this mechanism. Why do we call it "Metabolic Gridlock"? You have to remember that the brain is an energy hog. It is the most demanding organ in the human body. It only makes up about 2% of your total body weight, but it consumes roughly 20% of your total glucose. It needs a constant, steady supply of ATP to keep the neurons firing and the synapses healthy.

When a person develops systemic insulin resistance, something happens at the blood-brain barrier. We call this the BBB. The BBB begins to downregulate its insulin receptors. Think of it like a defense mechanism. There is so much insulin circulating in the blood that the brain tries to protect itself by shutting the gates. This creates a massive paradox. The blood glucose levels in the body might be high—maybe even too high—but that glucose cannot get into the brain cells. 

This leads to a state called cerebral glucose hypometabolism. The brain is literally starving for energy while the body is swimming in sugar. When the neurons can’t get the energy they need, they start to wither. This leads to synaptic loss. It also triggers the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques. In the functional medicine world, we don’t just see amyloid as a "bad" protein. We see it as the brain’s attempt to protect itself from oxidative stress caused by this energy crisis.

When you are explaining this to your clients, I want you to use an analogy. I call it the "Starving Mariner." Imagine you are on a boat in the middle of the ocean. There is water everywhere. You are surrounded by it. But you can’t drink it. You are dying of thirst in the middle of a literal sea of water. That is what is happening in your client’s brain. There is glucose everywhere in their blood, but none of it is usable energy for their neurons. This reframes their "brain fog" from a mysterious aging symptom into a tangible energy crisis. And the best part? An energy crisis is something we can fix.

Next, we need to talk about how we reveal this crisis. Standard medicine relies almost exclusively on HbA1c. But as a functional practitioner, you need to know that HbA1c is a lagging indicator. It tells us the 90-day average of blood sugar. It doesn’t tell us about the volatility. It doesn’t tell us about the compensatory mechanisms the body is using to keep that average stable.

Research from 2021 showed that fasting insulin levels can be elevated for ten to fifteen years before the HbA1c ever moves into the diabetic range. If you only look at HbA1c, you are missing a decade of opportunity for intervention. This is why we look at the "Reveals." 

First, we look at Fasting Insulin. In a perfect world, we want to see this between 2.0 and 5.0. If it’s higher than that, it’s an early indicator of metabolic pressure. The body is having to work too hard to keep blood sugar down. 

Second, we look at HOMA-IR. This is a calculation that looks at the balance between glucose and insulin. We want to see this below 1.5. It tells us how sensitive the cells actually are to the insulin being produced.

Third, we look at GlycoMark, which is also known as 1,5-anhydroglucitol. This is a fantastic marker because it measures glucose "spikes" over the last two weeks. It catches the post-meal surges that HbA1c often misses. We want this value to be greater than 12.0.

Finally, we look at Uric Acid. Most people associate uric acid with gout, but in functional medicine, it’s a marker for fructose-driven insulin resistance. High levels, meaning anything over 5.0, tell us that the liver is struggling with metabolic load.

In Susan’s case, her HbA1c was 5.8%. That’s borderline. But when we ran her fasting insulin, it was 18.4. Her body was screaming for help. Her pancreas was pumping out massive amounts of insulin just to keep her blood sugar "normal." But that high insulin was doing something dangerous. It was directly inhibiting her brain’s ability to perform autophagy. Autophagy is the cellular housecleaning process. It’s how the brain clears out debris and misfolded proteins. Because her insulin was always high, her brain never got the signal to clean itself up.

Now, how do we break this gridlock? This is the "Optimize" phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method. We have to provide the brain with an alternative fuel source. If the brain can’t use glucose because of insulin resistance, we have to give it something else. We have to bypass the broken system.

There are two primary dietary interventions we use. The first is the Clinical Ketogenic Diet, or CKD. Ketones are incredible because they can bypass the insulin-resistant glucose transporters. They don’t need the GLUT4 pathway. Instead, they enter the mitochondria directly through what we call monocarboxylate transporters, or MCTs. For a client like Susan, a 12-week nutritional ketosis protocol served as a "metabolic bypass surgery" for her brain. By getting her blood ketone levels between 0.5 and 1.5 millimoles, we were able to provide her neurons with the fuel they were starving for.

The second intervention is the Mediterranean-DASH diet, often called the MIND diet. While ketosis is powerful for "re-starting" the engine, the MIND diet is often more sustainable for long-term maintenance. It is rich in polyphenols from things like blueberries and leafy greens. These compounds improve vascular health and ensure that oxygen is actually reaching the neurons.

I want to give you a coach tip here. Many women over the age of forty are afraid of the word "keto." They’ve heard it will mess up their hormones or their thyroid. You need to reassure them that therapeutic ketosis is very different from the "bacon and butter" diets they see on social media. We focus on "Clean Keto." This means high fiber, healthy fats like avocado and olive oil, and high-quality wild fish. This supports the brain without crashing the thyroid.

Once we’ve optimized the fuel, we have to make sure the cellular furnaces can actually burn it. I’m talking about the mitochondria. In neurodegeneration, the mitochondria are often "leaky." They are producing more exhaust—which we call reactive oxygen species—than they are producing energy, or ATP. 

We use what I call the "Big Three" for mitochondrial support. First is PQQ, or Pyrroloquinoline Quinone. This is a mouthful, but it is a powerhouse. PQQ actually stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. That means it helps the body grow brand-new mitochondria, specifically in the hippocampus. 

Second is CoQ10, specifically in the form of Ubiquinol. This is the essential electron carrier in the energy production chain. A meta-analysis from 2022 found that CoQ10 significantly improved cognitive scores in patients with metabolic syndrome. It’s like making sure the spark plugs in the engine are clean.

Third is Alpha-Lipoic Acid, or ALA. This is what we call a "universal antioxidant" because it works in both water and fat-soluble environments. But more importantly, ALA improves insulin sensitivity by helping the glucose transporters move to the cell surface.

Let’s look back at Susan’s outcome. After six months of this metabolic optimization and targeted mitochondrial support, her transformation was profound. Her fasting insulin dropped from 18.4 down to 6.2. But the numbers weren't the most important part. We re-tested her MoCA score—that’s the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. She went from a 24, which indicates mild cognitive impairment, to a 28, which is in the normal range. 

Susan told me the "fog" had finally lifted. She was able to manage her complex school schedule without that 3 PM energy crash. She didn't have to retire early. She regained her professional confidence and, more importantly, her sense of self. This is the power of addressing the metabolic root cause.

The final phase of our work is the "Sustain" phase. We want to make sure the client doesn’t slip back into that gridlock. We use two primary tools for this: Continuous Glucose Monitoring and the Fasting-Mimicking Diet.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring, or CGM, is a game-changer. It provides real-time biofeedback. Susan learned very quickly that her "healthy" morning oatmeal was actually a disaster for her brain. Every time she ate it, her glucose would spike to 180. She would feel an immediate wave of brain fog. By switching to a breakfast focused on protein and healthy fats, she kept her glucose under 110. The CGM turned an abstract concept into a tangible reality for her.

The second tool is the Fasting-Mimicking Diet, or FMD. This is a five-day, low-calorie protocol that we have clients do once a quarter. It’s designed to trigger that autophagy we talked about earlier. It’s like a seasonal "housecleaning" for the brain. It removes damaged mitochondria and misfolded proteins that could lead to future decline.

Now, from a business perspective, I want you to see the value here. Offering CGM interpretation services is a high-ticket "Sustain" package. Many practitioners in our community charge between five hundred and a thousand dollars for a four-week CGM intensive. You are providing immense value and accountability, and the technology does a lot of the coaching for you.

Before we wrap up, let’s do a quick check of your understanding. I want you to think about these four questions. 

First, why is Type 2 Diabetes often called "Type 3 Diabetes" in the context of the brain? The answer is that it refers to the brain-specific insulin resistance that leads to glucose starvation in the neurons. Even if the body seems okay, the brain can be in a diabetic state.

Second, which marker is a better indicator of recent glucose "spikes" than HbA1c? That would be GlycoMark. It catches those post-meal surges that an average doesn’t show.

Third, what is the primary clinical benefit of a ketogenic diet for a client with cognitive decline? It’s the "metabolic bypass." Ketones provide an alternative fuel source that doesn’t rely on the broken insulin signaling pathway.

And fourth, how does PQQ support the hippocampus? It stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. It literally helps the brain grow more energy-producing units.

As we close this lesson, I want you to remember something important. You are not just managing blood sugar. You are protecting a human being’s identity. When Susan regained her memory, she regained her life. She regained her ability to connect with her family and contribute to her community. This is the meaningful work that we do. 

To summarize our key takeaways for today: 
First, remember that Type 3 Diabetes is a state of brain glucose starvation. Cognitive decline is often a metabolic issue at its core. 
Second, the "Reveal" is essential. You must look at fasting insulin and HOMA-IR for early detection. HbA1c is often too little, too late. 
Third, use the "Dual Fuel" strategy. Ketogenic interventions act as a bypass to fuel the brain when glucose can’t get in. 
Fourth, don’t forget the mitochondria. PQQ, CoQ10, and ALA are your big three for restoring cellular respiration. 
And finally, use technology like CGM to build sustainable, long-term resilience.

You are doing incredible work by mastering these concepts. You are becoming the practitioner that clients like Susan are desperately searching for. Great work today. I look forward to seeing you in the next lesson.
