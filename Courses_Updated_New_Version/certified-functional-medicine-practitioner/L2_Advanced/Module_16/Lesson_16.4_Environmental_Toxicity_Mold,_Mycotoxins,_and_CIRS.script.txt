Hi, it's Sarah. I am so glad you’re joining me for this session because we are about to tackle one of the most misunderstood and, frankly, one of the most life-changing areas of functional medicine. 

In our previous lesson, we spent a lot of time navigating the hormonal complexities of PCOS. We looked at insulin resistance and the delicate dance of the endocrine system. But today, we are pivoting. We are moving into the Environmental Node of our Functional Medicine Matrix. This is the place where we look for the hidden toxins that act like ghosts in the machine. Specifically, we’re talking about mold and mycotoxins. These are the "great masqueraders" of modern health. They can mimic autoimmune disorders, they can look exactly like chronic fatigue, and they can completely derail the endocrine system. To find the truth, we have to use the R.O.O.T.S. Method to dig deeper than a standard blood panel ever could.

Welcome to what I consider one of the most transformative lessons in this entire certification. Environmental toxicity is often the missing piece of the puzzle for the clients who have been everywhere and seen everyone. Think about the typical woman in your practice, maybe she’s between forty and fifty-five years old. She’s exhausted. Her brain feels like it’s wrapped in cotton wool. She’s been told by her primary care doctor that her fatigue is just a normal part of aging, or maybe it’s just perimenopause. But deep down, she knows something is fundamentally wrong. For these women, discovering CIRS—Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome—is often the key that finally unlocks their vitality. 

As a practitioner, mastering this niche does more than just provide profound relief to your clients. It establishes you as a high-level specialist. You become the person who can solve the "mystery illnesses" that conventional medicine often ignores or misdiagnoses. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to identify the clinical presentation of CIRS, analyze the significance of genetics and neurological testing, and construct a sequential detox protocol that actually works. We’re also going to look at the role of MARCoNS in persistent inflammation and how to design a plan for a truly clean living space.

Let me tell you a story about a client named Linda. Linda was forty-eight years old and an educator. She was a high-achiever, but she had reached a point where she could barely make it through a school day. She had seen three different specialists. Her rheumatologist suggested she had fibromyalgia. Her GP suggested she was depressed and handed her a prescription for antidepressants. 

When Linda came to me, we used the Reveal phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method. We stopped looking only at her symptoms and started looking at her environment. We ran a Visual Contrast Sensitivity test, which is a simple way to check for neurological impairment from toxins. She failed it significantly. Then, we ran a urinary mycotoxin profile. It showed sky-high levels of Ochratoxin A. Linda wasn’t depressed. She wasn’t "just getting older." She was living in a water-damaged building. The school where she taught had a history of roof leaks, and her home had a damp basement. Once we identified the source, her path to recovery finally became clear.

So, let’s define what we’re actually dealing with here. What is CIRS? It’s very important that you understand this: CIRS is not a "mold allergy." This is a common point of confusion. An allergy is an IgE-mediated immune response. That’s the body overreacting to a particle. CIRS is much more complex. It is a genetically-linked, multi-system, multi-symptom illness. It’s characterized by the body’s fundamental inability to clear biotoxins. 

In a healthy individual—about seventy-five percent of the population—the immune system works like a sophisticated piece of software. It identifies a toxin, like a mycotoxin from mold, tags it with an antibody, and then the liver and kidneys clear it out. But for the other twenty-five percent of the population, their immune system lacks that specific "software." They have a genetic predisposition that means their body doesn't recognize these toxins as "foreign." 

Instead of being cleared, the toxins just stay in the body, circulating over and over. This leads to a state of permanent innate immune activation. The body is effectively "on fire" all the time. It produces a flood of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier. They disrupt the HPA axis, which is why these clients have such weird hormonal issues. They also damage mitochondrial function, which explains the crushing fatigue. This is why the symptoms are so diverse. One client might have digestive distress, while another has cognitive decline, and a third has joint pain. They are all suffering from the same underlying inflammatory fire.

Now, here is a little "pro tip" for your clinical practice. I want you to start listening for what I call the "Static Shock" symptom. Ask your clients if they find themselves getting shocked by doorknobs or when they touch other people. It sounds like a quirky detail, right? But in the context of CIRS, it’s a major red flag. 

Here’s why it happens: The chronic inflammation from biotoxins often leads to a drop in antidiuretic hormone, or ADH. When ADH is low, the person can’t hold onto water properly. They get dehydrated, and their body starts to concentrate salt on the surface of the skin. That extra salt changes the body’s electrical conductivity. So, if your client says, "Sarah, I feel like a walking lightning bolt lately," your mold-radar should be going off. It’s a classic clinical sign of mold toxicity.

Now, how do we move from "suspecting" mold to "confirming" it? We use the Reveal process. We need specific functional markers because standard blood work usually looks "perfectly normal" for these clients, which only adds to their frustration. 

Research, including a major study from 2022, suggests that over fifty percent of buildings in the United States have some form of water damage. That’s a staggering number. It means this assessment is critical for almost every complex case you’ll see. 

First, we look at the HLA-DR genetics. This isn't a diagnostic for the illness itself, but it tells us if the client is in that vulnerable twenty-five percent. If they have the "mold-susceptible" gene, they literally cannot clear these toxins without help. 

Next, we use the VCS test. This is a Visual Contrast Sensitivity test. It’s a simple bedside or online test that measures the ability to see gray-scale contrast. It’s not about how well you see the letters on a chart; it’s about how your brain processes subtle differences in light. It is a highly sensitive marker for neuroinflammation. If a client fails this, it’s a very strong indicator that biotoxins are affecting their neurological function.

We also use urinary mycotoxin testing. This allows us to see exactly which metabolites are being filtered by the kidneys. Are we dealing with Aflatoxin? Ochratoxin? Or maybe Trichothecenes from black mold? Knowing the specific toxin helps us choose the right binders later on. 

Finally, we look at inflammatory markers like C4a and TGF-beta1. These aren't your standard CRP tests. These are markers of the innate immune response and tissue remodeling. When these are high, it tells us the body is in an active state of "biotoxin war."

Once we’ve confirmed the issue, we move into Targeted Detoxification. But I have to give you a word of caution here. You must be very careful with this population. If you try to release toxins too quickly in a client who is already very sick, you can trigger a Herxheimer reaction. This is essentially a massive flare-up of symptoms because the body can't process the sudden load of toxins being dumped into the bloodstream. It can make their neuroinflammation much worse.

We follow a very specific sequence. Step Zero—and I cannot emphasize this enough—is removing the exposure. You simply cannot heal in the same environment that made you sick. It’s like trying to put out a fire while someone is still pouring gasoline on it. Whether it’s professional remediation of their home or relocating to a temporary clean space, the client must get away from the source of the mold.

Once they are in a safe environment, we start with binders. Remember how I said these toxins are recycled? They go through what we call enterohepatic circulation. The liver processes them and dumps them into the bile, but then the gut reabsorbs them and sends them right back to the liver. It’s a never-ending loop. Binders act like a "trap." They sit in the gut and grab onto the toxins in the bile, ensuring they actually leave the body through the stool.

But here’s the secret: not all binders are created equal. You have to match the binder to the toxin. If the test shows Ochratoxin A, we might use Cholestyramine or activated charcoal. If we see Trichothecenes, which often come from Stachybotrys, or "black mold," we might need bentonite clay or chlorella. While we’re doing this, we also support Phase Two detox in the liver using liposomal glutathione and N-Acetyl Cysteine, or NAC. This gives the liver the raw materials it needs to process the toxic load.

Now, sometimes a client gets out of the mold, they start the binders, they feel a little better, but then they get "stuck." They still have lingering fatigue and brain fog. This is often due to the MARCoNS factor. 

MARCoNS stands for Multiple Antibiotic Resistant Coagulase Negative Staphylococci. It’s a mouthful, I know. But basically, it’s a very stubborn, resistant bacteria that colonizes the deep nasal passages of people who have been ill from biotoxins. These bacteria live in a protective "biofilm"—think of it like a microscopic suit of armor—that makes them very hard to kill. 

These bacteria produce something called hemolysins. These break down red blood cells and keep the inflammatory cycle going. But the biggest issue is that MARCoNS lowers a hormone called MSH, or Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone. MSH is a master regulator in the body. When it’s low, the client will have chronic pain, poor sleep, and persistent fatigue. 

If you ignore the nasal passages, the client often won't fully recover. Addressing MARCoNS usually involves a compounded nasal spray, something like a "BEG" spray or a silver-EDTA blend, designed to break through that biofilm and eradicate the bacteria. 

Mastering these nuances—understanding the link between the nose, the gut, and the environment—is what sets you apart as a practitioner. It allows you to work with high-complexity clients, even remotely. Many coaches in our community find that once they master these environmental protocols, they can charge a premium for their consultations. Why? Because they are providing a level of insight that ninety-nine percent of doctors simply don't have.

Finally, we have to talk about the Sustain phase. This is about long-term vigilance. For someone who is genetically susceptible to CIRS, their home environment is their medicine. A small leak under a kitchen sink that most people wouldn't even notice can trigger a massive inflammatory relapse for a CIRS patient within forty-eight hours. 

Sustenance strategies are non-negotiable. First, we need medical-grade HEPA air purification. I’m talking about filters like AirDoctor or IQAir that can capture particles down to 0.003 microns. Standard store-bought filters usually aren't enough for these clients. 

Second, we have to control humidity. Mold loves moisture. We need to keep the indoor relative humidity below fifty percent at all times to prevent fungal growth. I often recommend that clients keep hygrometers in several rooms so they can monitor this daily.

And third, we use periodic ERMI testing. This stands for Environmental Relative Moldiness Index. It’s a dust sample test that gives us a "DNA profile" of the mold in the home. It’s a great way to monitor the "microbiome" of the house and catch any new issues before they cause a physical flare-up.

As we wrap up today, I want to address something you might be feeling. You might be feeling a bit of "imposter syndrome." This is complex stuff. You might think, "Who am I to handle these cases?" 

But I want you to remember this: You are looking at the Environmental Node that almost everyone else has ignored. By simply validating your client’s experience—by telling them, "I believe you, and there is a reason you feel this way"—you are already offering them more hope than they have found in years of conventional "mystery illness" management. You are providing a roadmap where there was only a dead end.

Let’s do a quick verbal summary of our key takeaways. 
First, remember that CIRS is a genetic inability to clear biotoxins, and it affects about one out of every four people. 
Second, the Reveal phase is your diagnostic foundation. You must include HLA-DR genetics and VCS testing to differentiate CIRS from general everyday fatigue. 
Third, detoxification must be sequential. It’s a three-step dance: fix the environment first, then use the right binders, and then address the biofilms and MARCoNS. 
And fourth, sustenance requires medical-grade air filtration and very strict humidity control to prevent a relapse.

When you master environmental toxicity, you position yourself as an elite practitioner. You become capable of resolving those "untreatable" cases that others have given up on. 

Before we finish, I want you to reflect on a few things. Think about why a standard "mold allergy" test would come back negative for a CIRS patient. Remember the difference between an allergy and this genetic inflammatory response. Think about that "static shock" symptom and what it tells you about the client’s hormones. Consider why moving the client out of the environment is always "Step Zero." And finally, think about how those stubborn nasal bacteria can keep the whole body in a state of inflammation.

You are doing incredible work. Taking the time to understand these deep, environmental triggers is what will make you a truly world-class coach. 

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
