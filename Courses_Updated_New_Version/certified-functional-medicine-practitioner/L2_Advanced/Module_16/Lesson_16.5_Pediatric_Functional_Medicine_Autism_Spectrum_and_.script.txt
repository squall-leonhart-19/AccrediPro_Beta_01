Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you are joining me for this lesson. We are about to dive into one of the most heart-wrenching, yet incredibly rewarding areas of functional medicine. In our last lesson, we spent a lot of time talking about neuroinflammation in adults. We looked at how the aging brain or the stressed brain can become inflamed. But today, we are pivoting. We are looking at the unique physiological landscape of the pediatric patient. This is a world where everything moves faster. The pediatric brain is in a state of constant, rapid neurodevelopment. It is incredibly plastic. This means it is highly vulnerable to insults. But it also means it is remarkably resilient when we provide the right support.

In this lesson, I’m going to teach you about the Pediatric Neuro-Immunity Axis. We are going to talk about what happens when a child’s immune system and nervous system get their wires crossed. We often call this the "Brain on Fire" child. If you’ve ever worked with a family in this situation, you know how desperate they are. You see a child who undergoes a sudden, radical personality shift. Or perhaps a child who has been struggling with chronic neurodevelopmental delays for years. It is distressing for the parents. It is often confusing for the practitioners. But by applying The R.O.O.T.S. Method™, we can find a path forward. We are going to look at how microbial triggers lead to autoimmune encephalopathy. We will explore how functional nutrition provides a genuine lifeline.

By the time we finish today, you will be able to do a few critical things. You’ll be able to differentiate between PANS and PANDAS. These are terms that often get lumped together, but the nuances matter. You will learn how to interpret the Cunningham Panel and the Organic Acids Test. We’ll look at these specifically through a neuro-inflammatory lens. I’ll also show you how to design a targeted protocol using tools like Goldenseal and specific probiotics. We will discuss the practical side of the GF/CF/SF diet. This is the Gluten-Free, Casein-Free, Soy-Free approach. And finally, we will talk about how to sustain that resilience. We want to prevent future flares using Vitamin D3, K2, and Zinc.

Let’s start with the foundation. Pediatric Functional Medicine is not just "adult functional medicine in a smaller body." I want you to really hear that. The pediatric brain is a work in progress. It is learning how to process the world. At the same time, the immune system is also in school. It is learning to distinguish between a "self" cell and a "non-self" invader. When this learning process is interrupted, things go sideways. This interruption can come from environmental toxins. It can come from gut dysbiosis. It often comes from common infections. The result is often neuropsychiatric symptoms that seem to come out of nowhere.

This brings us to PANDAS and PANS. PANDAS stands for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections. PANS is broader. It stands for Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome. Both of these represent a spectrum of autoimmune encephalopathy. Think of this as a case of mistaken identity. The child gets an infection, like Strep or Lyme. The immune system creates antibodies to fight that infection. But because of something called molecular mimicry, those antibodies get confused. They cross the blood-brain barrier. Instead of just attacking the bacteria, they attack the basal ganglia. This is the part of the brain responsible for movement and behavior. It’s like the brain’s control center for "smoothness" in both body and mind. When the basal ganglia are under fire, the result is chaos.

I want to take a moment to talk about the business side of this. Pediatric Functional Medicine is one of the highest-demand niches in our field. Parents are often told by conventional doctors that their child will "grow out of it." Or they are given a behavioral diagnosis without any investigation into the "why." When a practitioner can offer a root-cause explanation, it changes everything. I’ve seen coaches command very high fees for these consultations. Why? Because parents aren't just looking for a supplement. They are looking for a partner who understands the science of their child’s "brain on fire."

To make this real, let’s talk about Leo. Leo was a seven-year-old boy. He was, by all accounts, a "normal" kid. He played soccer. He liked school. But then, he had a mild sore throat. It wasn't even a severe case of Strep. Three weeks later, something changed. It happened almost overnight. Leo developed debilitating OCD. He started lining up his shoes in the hallway for hours. If one shoe was slightly out of place, he would have a massive meltdown. He also developed facial tics. He began using "baby talk" again, which he hadn't done in years. Most heartbreakingly, he developed severe separation anxiety. He was terrified of leaving his mother’s side. He wouldn't even go into another room alone.

Leo’s pediatrician suggested a behavioral therapist. They also mentioned a low-dose SSRI. They told the parents that "sometimes kids go through phases." But Leo’s mother knew this wasn't a phase. A child doesn't change their entire personality in 24 hours because of a phase. From a Functional Medicine perspective, that "overnight" shift is a massive red flag. It points directly to an immune trigger. We didn't wait. We moved immediately into the Reveal phase of our method.

In Leo’s case, we used two gold-standard functional tests. If you are going to work in this niche, you must understand these markers. The first is the Cunningham Panel. This is a specialized blood test. It measures the level of circulating antibodies that associate with the basal ganglia. Research shows that high levels of these antibodies, specifically Anti-Dopamine Receptor D1 and D2, correlate strongly with motor tics. They also correlate with the psychiatric symptoms we see in PANS and PANDAS. For Leo, this test was a turning point. It gave his parents objective proof. It showed that his behavior wasn't a choice or a parenting failure. It was a biological event.

The second test we used was the Organic Acids Test, or the OAT. I like to think of the OAT as a "liquid biopsy" of the child’s metabolism. In pediatric cases, we look for very specific markers. The first is HPHPA. This is a metabolite produced by Clostridia bacteria. Why does this matter? Because HPHPA inhibits the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. This leads to an excess of dopamine in the brain. Now, we usually think of dopamine as a "feel-good" chemical. But too much dopamine in the wrong place leads to irritability, aggression, and sensory overload.

We also look for Arabinitol. This is a marker for Candida or yeast overgrowth. It often correlates with that "brain fog" parents describe. And we look at Oxalates. These are metabolic byproducts that can cause physical pain. In children with autism or neuro-inflammation, high oxalates often lead to "stimming" behaviors. The child is trying to process the physical discomfort in their body. When a parent tells you their child changed overnight, you have to believe them. Conventional medicine might dismiss it as an exaggeration. But in our world, it is the primary clinical clue.

Once we had Leo’s results, we moved into the Target phase. The Reveal phase showed elevated Strep antibodies and high Clostridia markers. Our goal was two-fold. We had to eradicate the microbial trigger. And we had to calm the neuro-immune storm. For the microbial piece, we used Goldenseal. This is a potent tool in the pediatric toolkit. It contains berberine. Research has shown that berberine can inhibit the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes. It also targets certain Clostridia species. What’s great about Goldenseal is that it’s effective without being as destructive as pharmaceutical antibiotics. It helps shift the balance without wiping out the entire internal ecosystem.

At the same time, we had to address the gut-brain axis. We used a specific probiotic strain called Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. This isn't just any probiotic. Research shows this strain helps modulate the immune response. It can actually help strengthen the gut-brain axis. There is even evidence suggesting it may reduce the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. If we can keep those "confused" antibodies out of the brain, we can stop the fire.

But we can't just rely on supplements. In pediatric functional medicine, the "patient" is the whole family. This is the Optimization phase. I always tell my students: if one child is on a restrictive diet while the siblings are eating pizza in front of them, the protocol will fail. It creates stress, and stress is inflammatory. We implemented the GF/CF/SF diet for Leo’s entire household. That’s Gluten-Free, Casein-Free, and Soy-Free.

Let’s talk about why these three are the "big three." First, gluten and casein. In many children with neuro-inflammation, these proteins don't break down properly. Instead, they turn into gluteomorphins and casomorphins. These are opioid-like compounds. They cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to opioid receptors. This is why some children seem "spaced out" or "foggy" after eating bread or cheese. It’s also why they can become literally addicted to these foods. They are getting a chemical high from them. Then there is soy. Soy is often highly processed. It can interfere with the delicate endocrine balance in a developing child.

Here is a coach tip I want you to remember. In these cases, the 80/20 rule does not apply. We aren't looking for "mostly" gluten-free. In a child with autoimmune encephalopathy, even a tiny amount of gluten can trigger an immune flare. That flare can last for weeks. We aim for 100% compliance during the initial three-month Target phase. It sounds strict, but when parents see the changes, they become the biggest advocates for it.

As Leo started to improve, we moved into the Sustain phase. We wanted to build a "buffer." We didn't want him to relapse the next time he caught a common cold. We focused on three key nutrients. First, Vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D is much more than a vitamin. It’s a master immune modulator. A 2022 meta-analysis found that children with ASD had significantly lower Vitamin D levels than their peers. Vitamin D helps "teach" the immune system. It helps the body produce T-regulatory cells. These are the cells that tell the immune system, "Hey, don't attack our own brain tissue."

Next, we focused on Zinc. Zinc is essential for the integrity of both the gut lining and the blood-brain barrier. It’s the "glue" that keeps the barriers strong. Interestingly, zinc deficiency is often linked to picky eating. Zinc affects how we perceive taste and smell. When a child is zinc-deficient, food tastes bland or "off," so they stick to the same three beige foods. By supplementing zinc, we often see their palate expand, which makes the GF/CF diet much easier to manage.

So, what happened with Leo? After four months on this protocol—the Goldenseal, the strict diet, and the D3 and Zinc—his OCD symptoms were reduced by 80%. His facial tics vanished completely. He was able to sleep in his own room again. His mother told me, "I have my son back. He’s not lining up shoes anymore. He’s out playing with his friends." That is the power of this work. We didn't just mask the symptoms. We addressed the "brain on fire" at the source.

Let’s take a moment to check your understanding of these concepts. Think about the primary difference between PANS and PANDAS. Remember, PANDAS is specifically about Strep. PANS is the broader umbrella. It can be triggered by Lyme, the flu, or even environmental toxins. Both result in the same "brain on fire" symptoms, but the trigger varies.

Next, why is that HPHPA marker on the OAT test so important for behavior? It all comes down to dopamine. HPHPA blocks the enzyme that converts dopamine into norepinephrine. This leads to a dopamine buildup. In the brain, that excess dopamine translates to irritability and aggression. If you see a child who is suddenly aggressive, check their Clostridia markers.

What about the "opioid effect" of gluten and dairy? This is such a key concept to explain to parents. When the gut is compromised, these proteins break down into gluteomorphins and casomorphins. They act like drugs in the brain. This explains the "brain fog" and the addictive eating patterns we see in so many of these kids.

Finally, which nutrient is the "teacher" for the immune system? That’s Vitamin D3. It regulates those T-regulatory cells. It’s the peacekeeper that prevents the immune system from launching an autoimmune attack on the brain.

As we wrap up, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, remember that an acute onset is a massive red flag. If a parent says their child changed overnight, believe them. Investigate the immune system immediately. Second, understand the basal ganglia connection. PANS and PANDAS are essentially "rheumatic fever of the brain." The immune system is attacking the control center.

Third, test, don't guess. Use the Cunningham Panel and the OAT. These tests provide the objective data you need to guide the protocol. They also help skeptical parents and doctors understand what is really happening. Fourth, dietary foundations are non-negotiable. The GF/CF/SF diet is often the very first step in recovery. And finally, remember your role. You are a guide for the family. You aren't just giving them a list of supplements. You are providing the "why" behind their child’s behavior. You are giving them hope based on science.

This work is profound. You are changing the trajectory of a child’s life. You are helping them regain their potential. It requires patience and precision, but the results are worth every bit of effort. Great work today. I’m so proud of the practitioner you are becoming. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
