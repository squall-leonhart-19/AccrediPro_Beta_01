Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you have joined me for this session. In our last lesson, we spent a lot of time talking about metabolic gridlock. We looked at how insulin resistance and high blood sugar can really gum up the works for many women with PCOS. But today, we are shifting gears into a world that is a bit more nuanced and, frankly, a lot more misunderstood. We are entering the world of hormonal complexity, specifically focusing on what we call the lean PCOS paradox.

As a practitioner, you are going to encounter women who just do not fit the standard mold. They are not struggling with weight. They might even be quite thin. Yet, they are dealing with the exact same symptoms of androgen excess, like cystic acne, hair loss, or the heartbreak of infertility. Conventional medicine often misses these women entirely because they do not look like the textbook definition of PCOS. They are told their labs are fine or that they just need to relax. But you and I know there is always a root cause. Today, we are going to use the R.O.O.T.S. Method to pull back the curtain on why this happens and how you can help these clients find their way back to balance.

Let us start by looking at the numbers. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. It affects between eight and thirteen percent of women globally. That is a massive number of people. Now, while the classic phenotype is usually linked to obesity and severe insulin resistance, about twenty to thirty percent of these cases present as lean PCOS. In these cases, the primary driver is not necessarily systemic insulin resistance. Instead, we are often looking at adrenal androgen excess and a very sensitive HPA axis.

Think about the HPA axis for a moment. That is the connection between your hypothalamus, your pituitary, and your adrenal glands. In lean PCOS, this system is often hypersensitive. These women usually have a BMI under twenty-three. They look healthy on the outside, but inside, their bodies are sending out a distress signal. Because they do not have the classic weight markers, they often spend years searching for answers. They might have been on birth control since they were teenagers to hide their acne, and only when they go off it to try for a baby do they realize something is deeply wrong.

When you compare classic PCOS to lean PCOS, the differences are striking. In classic cases, hyperinsulinemia is the main engine. But in lean PCOS, it is all about adrenal stress and HPA dysfunction. While a woman with classic PCOS has significantly impaired insulin sensitivity, a woman with lean PCOS often has normal peripheral insulin sensitivity. Her blood sugar might look perfect on a standard lab. The androgen source is different too. In classic cases, it is primarily the ovarian theca cells. In lean PCOS, it is a mix of both ovarian and adrenal contributions, specifically high levels of DHEA-S.

One thing I want you to be very careful about is diet. You might be tempted to put every PCOS client on a very low-carb or keto diet because that is what the headlines say. But for these lean clients, that can be a huge mistake. Unlike the classic phenotype, these women often need a healthy amount of complex carbohydrates. Carbs signal safety to the HPA axis. If you cut them too low, you can actually trigger more cortisol production and create even more hormonal chaos. We want to signal to the body that it is safe to reproduce, not that it is in the middle of a famine.

Now, to really understand what is happening under the surface, we have to move beyond basic blood work. Serum testing is just a snapshot in time. It tells us what is in the blood at that exact second, but it does not tell us the whole story. That is why I love the Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones, or the DUTCH test. It allows us to see the metabolism of these hormones. It is like the difference between seeing a still photo and watching a full-length movie.

One of the most important things we look at on a DUTCH test is the androgen pathway, specifically an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. In many PCOS cases, the body has a preference for this pathway. This enzyme takes testosterone and converts it into something called 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone, or DHT. Here is the catch: DHT is three to five times more potent than regular testosterone. This explains why a client might come to you with normal total testosterone on a blood test but still has terrible cystic acne. They are not necessarily making too much testosterone, but they are over-converting it into a much more aggressive form.

We also have to look at DHEA-S. This hormone is produced almost exclusively by the adrenal glands. In lean PCOS, we frequently see elevated DHEA-S while the ovarian androgens, like androstenedione, might only be mildly high. This is a huge clue. It tells us that we need to focus on the adrenal node of the Functional Medicine Matrix rather than just looking at the ovaries. It is a communication issue, not just a plumbing issue.

Let me tell you about a client I worked with named Elena. She is a great example of this. Elena was thirty-four years old and worked in a high-stress tech career. Her BMI was twenty-one point five, so she was quite lean. She came to me because she had been trying to get pregnant for eighteen months with no luck. She was also dealing with adult acne that made her feel like a teenager again, and she had that classic wired but tired energy. She would be exhausted all day, but as soon as her head hit the pillow, her mind would start racing.

When we ran her DUTCH test, the results were eye-opening. Her DHEA-S was very high at four hundred and fifty micrograms per deciliter. She had high 5-alpha-reductase activity, meaning she was pushing her hormones down that potent DHT pathway. But the most telling part was her adrenal pattern. She had what we call Stage Two Adrenal Dysfunction. Her cortisol was very high at night, which explained why she could not sleep, but it was low in the morning, which explained why she felt like a zombie when she woke up. Elena’s PCOS was not a metabolic failure; it was a manifestation of her HPA axis being stuck in survival mode. Her body was prioritizing stress hormones over reproductive hormones because it did not feel safe enough to support a pregnancy.

This brings us to the adrenal-ovarian connection. You have to remember that the HPA axis and the HPO axis, which is the ovarian axis, are not separate. They are constantly talking to each other. When the hypothalamus perceives stress, it releases Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone, or CRH. High levels of CRH can directly inhibit the release of GnRH, which is the master hormone for reproduction.

When the pulses of GnRH are disrupted, the pituitary gets confused. It starts producing way too much Luteinizing Hormone, or LH, compared to Follicle Stimulating Hormone, or FSH. You will often see this as a two-to-one or even a three-to-one ratio on a lab. That high LH level constantly hammers the theca cells in the ovaries, telling them to make more androgens. This effectively traps the woman in a state where she cannot ovulate. She is stuck in a loop where stress leads to high LH, which leads to high androgens, which prevents ovulation.

When you are talking to your clients, I want you to ask about their stress chronology. Do not just ask if they are stressed now. Ask them when their symptoms started. You will almost always find a connection. Maybe their cycles became irregular when they started a high-pressure job. Maybe their acne flared up when they were over-training for a marathon. Identifying that trigger is a key part of the healing process.

Before we even think about supplements, we have to talk about the environment. This is the optimize phase of our method. Hormonal signaling is governed by circadian biology. We have a master clock in our brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN. It coordinates the timing of every hormone in the body. For a woman with PCOS, circadian disruption is like an orchestra where the violins are in one time zone and the woodwinds are in another. No matter how good the individual players are, the music is going to sound terrible.

Melatonin is a huge player here. We usually think of it as a sleep hormone, but it is also a powerful antioxidant. It is actually found in very high concentrations inside the follicular fluid that surrounds the egg. It protects the egg from oxidative stress. If a woman has low melatonin because she is a night owl or because she is staring at a blue-light screen late at night, her egg quality suffers. This is a direct link between lifestyle and fertility.

One of the simplest and most effective things you can recommend is morning sunlight. Getting natural light into the eyes within thirty minutes of waking up resets the cortisol awakening response. This helps stabilize the HPA axis and tells the brain exactly what time it is. It is a foundational step that costs nothing but makes everything else work better.

Once that foundation is set, then we can move into the target phase with precision nutraceuticals. We want to use specific tools to shift those biochemical pathways we identified. One of my favorite tools is Inositol. But you have to use the right kind. Recent research, including a major meta-analysis from 2023, has shown that a 40-to-1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the gold standard. Inositol acts as a second messenger for FSH. It helps the ovaries actually hear the signal to ovulate. It is like turning up the volume on a radio station that was previously just static.

If we see that high 5-alpha-reductase activity on a DUTCH test, we might look at Saw Palmetto. It is a natural inhibitor of that enzyme. It helps reduce the androgenic load on the skin and the hair follicles. It is a much gentler way to manage symptoms than pharmaceutical anti-androgens, which can have significant side effects.

Then there is Vitex, or Chaste Tree Berry. This is incredibly useful when high LH is the main driver. Vitex has dopaminergic effects that can help lower prolactin and normalize that LH to FSH ratio. This supports the corpus luteum and helps the body produce enough progesterone in the second half of the cycle. Progesterone is the hormone of pregnancy, but it is also the hormone of calm. Many of these lean PCOS clients are desperately low in progesterone, which only adds to their feelings of anxiety and stress.

I always tell my students and my clients to be patient. Hormonal re-patterning is not an overnight process. It takes about ninety to one hundred and twenty days for an egg to mature before it is released. That means we are working with the next batch of eggs, not just the ones for this month. You need to manage expectations and let them know that a three-to-six-month window is a realistic timeframe for seeing significant changes.

Finally, we move into the sustain phase. The goal here is to move from fixing a problem to building long-term resilience. Even after a client’s cycles have regulated or they have achieved a pregnancy, we have to keep an eye on the future. Women with PCOS have some unique long-term risks. One is bone density. If a woman is not ovulating regularly, she is not making enough progesterone. Progesterone is vital for bone remodeling. We need to make sure we are supporting her bone health as she ages.

There is also the risk of metabolic drift. Even if a woman is lean now, her risk for Type 2 Diabetes is higher as she moves toward menopause. We want to keep those healthy habits in place to prevent that drift from happening.

I want to share a success story from one of our practitioners. She was a forty-eight-year-old former nurse who was working with a lean PCOS client. This client had been through three years of failed IVF treatments. She was exhausted and ready to give up. Our practitioner didn't just look at her ovaries; she looked at her HPA axis and her circadian rhythm. They worked on light exposure, adrenal support, and the right inositol ratio. Within a few months, the client’s cycles regulated, and she ended up conceiving naturally. It was a life-changing moment for the client, and for the practitioner, it was a career-defining success. She now runs a very successful fertility program from home, charging premium rates because she can solve the problems that conventional medicine misses.

So, let us recap what we have covered today. First, remember that lean PCOS is driven more by adrenal stress and HPA axis hypersensitivity than by classic insulin resistance. You cannot treat every PCOS client the same way.

Second, functional testing like the DUTCH test is your best friend. You need to know if the problem is coming from the ovaries, the adrenals, or a specific metabolic pathway like 5-alpha-reductase.

Third, never underestimate the power of the HPA-HPO connection. Stress is not just a feeling; it is a biochemical signal that can shut down fertility. CRH and LH are key players in this hormonal traffic jam.

Fourth, foundations matter. Circadian entrainment and melatonin support are not optional. They are essential for egg quality and hormonal signaling.

And finally, use your nutraceuticals with precision. The 40-to-1 inositol ratio and targeted herbs like Saw Palmetto and Vitex can help restore balance without the need for harsh pharmaceuticals.

You are doing such important work. By understanding these nuances, you are becoming the practitioner that these women have been searching for. You are giving them answers when everyone else just gave them a prescription or a shrug.

Great work today. I am so proud of the progress you are making in this certification. Keep diving deep, keep asking why, and I will see you in the next lesson.
