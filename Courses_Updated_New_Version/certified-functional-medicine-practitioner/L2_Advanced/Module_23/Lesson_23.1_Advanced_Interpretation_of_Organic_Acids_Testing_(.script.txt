Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. It is so good to have you back with me as we dive into one of the most transformative lessons in our entire certification. We have spent a lot of time recently in Module 7 and Module 8 talking about the foundations of bioenergetics and the slow, often silent process of mitochondrial decay. But today, we are shifting gears. We are moving from the high-level theory of physiology into the actual, hands-on mastery of the most sophisticated metabolic tool you will ever use in your practice: the Organic Acids Test, or the OAT.

I remember the first time I looked at an OAT report. I was overwhelmed. There were pages and pages of markers with names that sounded like they belonged in a high-school chemistry textbook, not a clinical consultation. But as I began to see the patterns, I realized that this test is the ultimate chemical blueprint. It shows us exactly what is happening beneath the waterline of our clients' symptoms. If symptoms are the tip of the iceberg, the OAT is the sonar that tells us how deep that iceberg goes and exactly what it is made of.

In this lesson, I am going to teach you how to move beyond a basic high or low reading. We aren't just looking for red flags on a page; we are learning advanced enzymatic interpretation. I want you to start seeing the OAT not as a static list of markers, but as a dynamic, living map of cellular energy, neurological health, and microbial influence. By the time we finish today, you will be able to analyze complex Krebs cycle intermediates to find specific blockages. You will understand how certain bacteria can actually hijack a client's brain chemistry. You will know how to use neurotransmitter ratios to explain why a client feels both wired and tired. And most importantly, you will know how to integrate all of this into the Reveal phase of our R.O.O.T.S. Method to provide the kind of targeted intervention that changes lives.

Let’s start with the heart of cellular energy: the Krebs Cycle, or the Citric Acid Cycle. I like to think of the Krebs cycle as the engine of the cell. It is a continuous loop of chemical reactions that takes the food we eat and turns it into the ATP we need to survive and thrive. When we look at an OAT and see elevations in these intermediates—things like Citrate, Succinate, or Malate—it is a common mistake to think the body is simply making too much of them. But in biology, elevations usually mean the opposite of abundance. They indicate an enzymatic blockage.

Imagine a busy four-way intersection. When everything is working well, cars flow through smoothly. But if one of the traffic lights breaks, the cars start backing up. That backup is what we see on the OAT. The elevation is the traffic jam. Our job as practitioners is to figure out why the light is broken. Usually, it comes down to one of three things: a nutrient deficiency, heavy metal toxicity, or oxidative stress. These are the things that "break" our enzymes.

To interpret this at an advanced level, you have to know the co-factors. Every enzyme in the Krebs cycle is like a worker that requires specific tools to do its job. For example, let’s look at the conversion of alpha-ketoglutaric acid to succinic acid. This step uses a massive enzyme complex called Alpha-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase. This worker is demanding—it requires five different tools: Vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, and Lipoic Acid. If a client is deficient in even one of those, the whole process stalls, and alpha-ketoglutaric acid starts to climb.

Let’s look at some other specific blockages you’ll see. If you see high levels of Citrate and Isocitrate, your mind should immediately go to an enzyme called Aconitase. This is a fascinating enzyme because it contains something called an iron-sulfur cluster. It is incredibly sensitive. If your client is chronically iron-deficient, that enzyme cannot function. But even more common is oxidative stress. Oxidative stress "attacks" that iron-sulfur cluster, disabling the enzyme. So, when you see high Citrate, don't just reach for a B-complex. You need to ask yourself if the client is dealing with high oxidative burden or if their iron status is sub-optimal.

Then we have Succinate. If Succinate is high, we look at Succinate Dehydrogenase. This enzyme is a bridge between the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. Its primary co-factors are Vitamin B2, also known as Riboflavin, and CoQ10. I’ve seen so many cases of profound fatigue where the only major finding was a massive Succinate peak. These clients have often been told their labs are normal, but they can barely get out of bed. When you provide that targeted B2 and CoQ10, you aren't just giving them a supplement; you are fixing the broken traffic light in their metabolic highway.

I want to share a story about a former student of mine named Sarah. She was a school teacher for nearly twenty years before she burned out and decided to transition into functional medicine. Like many of you, she struggled at first with the "legitimacy" of her new career. She felt like she was just guessing. But then, she mastered OAT interpretation. She had a client who had suffered from chronic fatigue for a decade. This client had seen every specialist in the city. Sarah ran an OAT and found a massive Succinate blockage. She didn't guess; she knew exactly what to do. Within three months of targeted therapy, that client was back to hiking. Sarah told me that understanding the Krebs cycle gave her the legitimacy she had been craving. She stopped guessing and started knowing. And because of that expertise, she was able to transition her practice to high-level, premium consultations because she was solving problems no one else could.

Now, let’s move into what I consider the most clinically significant section of the OAT: the microbial markers, specifically the Clostridia markers. We are looking at two main ones: HPHPA and 4-cresol. In the past, people just thought of these as signs of "bad bacteria" in the gut. But research now shows us they are so much more than that. They are potent neurotoxins.

The mechanism here is truly profound and it explains so many neuropsychiatric symptoms we see in our offices. These Clostridia metabolites actually inhibit an enzyme called Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase, or DBH. This enzyme has a very specific job: it converts Dopamine into Norepinephrine. When HPHPA or 4-cresol are present, they block that conversion. This creates a dangerous "double whammy" in the brain.

First, you get an excess of Dopamine. Now, we often think of Dopamine as the "feel good" chemical, but too much of a good thing is toxic. When Dopamine builds up inside the neurons and can't be converted, it starts to auto-oxidize. It turns into something called dopamine quinones. These are highly reactive and cause direct oxidative damage to the brain tissue. This can manifest as intense irritability, aggression, or even OCD tendencies.

At the same time, because the conversion is blocked, the client develops a deficiency in Norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is our "focus and drive" neurotransmitter. It gives us that steady, calm alertness. Without it, the client feels profound brain fog and fatigue. This is the classic "wired but tired" executive or the child with ADHD who is hyperactive but can't focus on a single task. They have the dopamine drive, but they lack the norepinephrine control. When you see high HPHPA on a test, you aren't just looking at a gut issue; you are looking at the root cause of a "Dopamine Storm."

This leads us naturally into Section 3, where we look at the neurotransmitter metabolites themselves: VMA, HVA, and 5-HIAA. The OAT doesn't measure neurotransmitters directly in the brain—nothing really can—but it measures their breakdown products in the urine. To be a premium practitioner, you have to look at the ratios, specifically the HVA to VMA ratio.

HVA is the primary metabolite of Dopamine. VMA is the primary metabolite of Norepinephrine and Epinephrine. In a healthy person, these should be somewhat in balance. But if you see a high HVA to VMA ratio—meaning HVA is high and VMA is low—that is your smoking gun for the Clostridia-induced DBH inhibition we just talked about. It confirms that the traffic jam isn't just in the gut; it is affecting the brain.

On the other hand, what if all the markers are low? What if HVA, VMA, and the serotonin marker 5-HIAA are all at the bottom of the range? This tells a different story. It tells us the building blocks are missing. We need to look at protein digestion. Is the client struggling with hypochlorhydria, or low stomach acid? Are they even eating enough amino acids? You can't build a house without bricks, and you can't build neurotransmitters without protein. This is where your clinical intake and the R.O.O.T.S. timeline become so important.

Next, I want to talk about something that is often misunderstood: Oxalates and the fungal connection. Oxalates are highly reactive molecules that can form sharp, needle-like crystals in the body's tissues. They can settle in the kidneys, causing stones, or in the joints, causing pain, or even in the vulva, leading to a condition called vulvodynia. On the OAT, we look at Oxalic, Glyceric, and Glycolic acids.

Most people assume high oxalates come from eating too much spinach, beets, or almonds. And while diet is certainly a factor, there are two other sources you must consider. The first is endogenous production—some people have genetic SNPs that make them "super-producers" of oxalates. But the most common clinical finding I see is the fungal connection. Certain species of fungus, like Aspergillus and Candida, actually produce oxalates as a metabolic byproduct.

This is a huge "aha" moment for many practitioners. If you see high Oxalic acid alongside high Arabinose—which is a key yeast marker—you are likely dealing with a fungal-driven oxalate issue. If you just put that client on a low-oxalate diet, you might see some temporary relief, but the symptoms will keep coming back because the "fungal factory" is still inside them. You have to treat the yeast and the fungus to truly solve the oxalate problem.

Now, let's talk about how we bring all of this together using the R.O.O.T.S. Method. In our Reveal phase, the OAT is our ultimate objective validator. It allows us to move from the "Organize" phase, where we are mapping out symptoms on a timeline, to the "Target" phase, where we provide specific biochemical support.

I want to tell you about a client named Linda. She was a 52-year-old Chief Marketing Officer for a major firm. She came to see me because she was suffering from severe anxiety, debilitating insomnia, and what she described as "brain zaps." Her doctors wanted to put her on SSRIs, but she felt like something else was going wrong.

When we ran her OAT, the results were striking. Her HPHPA was 450—that is incredibly high. Her HVA was elevated at 12.5, but her VMA was only 1.2. There was that high ratio we talked about. And to top it off, her Arabinose was 85, indicating a significant yeast overgrowth.

Instead of a standard anti-anxiety protocol, we targeted the root. We used high-dose, specific probiotics and botanical antimicrobials to clear the Clostridia and the yeast. We also supported her DBH enzyme with Vitamin C and Copper, which are its essential co-factors. Within just six weeks, Linda’s anxiety had reduced by 70 percent. Her "brain zaps" vanished. By stabilizing her dopamine levels and clearing the neurotoxins, we gave her her life back.

When you are explaining these results to a client like Linda, I find it helpful to use an analogy. I tell them, "This test is like looking under the hood of your car while the engine is running. It shows us exactly where the fuel isn't burning properly and why your 'check engine' light—which are your symptoms—is on." It makes the complex biochemistry feel accessible and actionable for them.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to keep in your mind as you start reviewing OAT reports. First, remember that high Krebs cycle markers are traffic jams. They don't mean the body is overproducing energy; they mean there is a blockage caused by a lack of nutrients or an abundance of toxins.

Second, never ignore the Clostridia markers. HPHPA and 4-cresol are the "Dopamine Trap." They lead to neurotoxicity and can be the hidden driver behind everything from aggression to chronic brain fog.

Third, always look at the ratios. The HVA to VMA ratio is far more clinically significant than either marker on its own when you are trying to assess a client's focus and neurological health.

Fourth, remember the fungal synergy. If oxalates are high, look at the yeast markers before you start stripping every healthy vegetable out of your client's diet.

And finally, use the OAT as your guide in the Reveal phase. It is the bridge that takes you from subjective symptoms to targeted, objective biochemical repair.

You are doing incredible work by mastering these advanced techniques. I know it can feel like a lot to take in, but every time you look at a lab, it will get easier. You are building the expertise that sets you apart as a true leader in functional medicine.

Great work today. I am so proud of the progress you are making. I will see you in the next lesson.
