Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. Welcome back to our advanced training. I am so glad you are joining me for this specific lesson because we are about to dive into what I consider the most significant clinical barrier in modern functional medicine. In our previous sessions together, we mastered the art of Organic Acids Testing and we explored the complexities of the Mycobiome. But today, we are going to confront the stubborn, invisible barriers that often stand between your client and true resolution. We are talking about environmental toxicants.

This is the lesson where we bridge the gap between just knowing something is wrong and actually targeting the root cause with clinical precision. For many of the clients you are going to see, especially those women over forty who have tried every diet, every supplement, and every yoga retreat only to still feel exhausted and foggy, environmental toxicants are the silent drivers of their cellular dysfunction. Today, we move beyond the basic green juice detox. We are moving into clinical-grade mobilization and chelation strategies.

In this lesson, I am going to teach you how to interpret advanced provocation testing for heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic. We are going to do a deep dive into the world of mycotoxins, specifically looking at things like Ochratoxin A and Aflatoxin and how they contribute to Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. I will help you design multi-phase detoxification protocols that use binder rotations and Phase three upregulation. We will also evaluate why liposomal delivery systems and IV nutrient therapies are so vital for bypassing a compromised GI tract. Finally, we will implement the optimize phase, which is all about preparing the body's exit routes before we ever start moving toxins around.

Let's start by talking about how we actually find these toxins. We call this advanced provocation testing and urinary analysis. Now, you might hear some conventional doctors say that blood tests are the gold standard for heavy metals. And they are right, but only if you were exposed yesterday. Blood levels are excellent for assessing acute, immediate exposure. If someone just swallowed a lead fishing weight, check their blood. But blood rarely reflects the total body burden. Heavy metals are incredibly "sticky." They want to get out of the blood and into storage as fast as possible. They hide in the bone, the fat, and the nervous tissue.

To truly reveal the burden, we use provocation testing. This involves giving a client a chelating agent, something like DMSA or DMPS. These agents act like a chemical magnet. They go into the tissues, grab the metals, and pull them into the bloodstream so they can be filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. We then collect that urine over a set period of time. Now, some toxicologists argue against this because there are no perfect reference ranges for "provoked" urine. But in our world, we aren't looking for a diagnosis of acute poisoning. We are looking for the mobilizable pool. We want to know what is sitting in those tissues driving mitochondrial decay or keeping the immune system in a state of constant high alert.

Think about lead for a moment. It is everywhere, especially in older homes with old paint or pipes. It even shows up in some cosmetics and aviation fuel. Clinically, lead is a major driver of hypertension and cognitive decline. It even contributes to bone loss because the body mistakes lead for calcium and stores it right in the skeletal system. When we provoke, we often see lead levels spike in women going through menopause because as their bones break down, the lead is released back into the system. For lead, we often look to DMSA or EDTA as our primary tools.

Then we have mercury. This is a big one for our clients with amalgam fillings or those who eat a lot of large predatory fish like tuna or swordfish. Mercury is a neurotoxin. It causes tremors, anxiety, that heavy brain fog, and it is a massive trigger for autoimmunity. For mercury, DMPS and DMSA are usually our go-to agents. We also have to watch for cadmium, which we see a lot in smokers or even people exposed to second-hand smoke. It is also found in some jewelry and certain grains. Cadmium is notoriously hard on the kidneys and can lead to osteopenia. And let's not forget arsenic. It is more common than you think, hiding in well water, rice, and even treated wood. Arsenic is a master of metabolic syndrome and neuropathy. When we see a client who can't lose weight no matter what, we often look at their arsenic levels.

Now, let's shift our focus to mycotoxins. These are not the mold spores themselves. Think of mycotoxins as the chemical weapons produced by mold. They are secondary metabolites, and they are incredibly small. Because they are lipophilic, meaning they love fat, they easily cross the blood-brain barrier and slide right through cell membranes. This is why mold illness feels so much like a whole-body breakdown.

There are a few key mycotoxins you need to have on your radar. First is Ochratoxin A, which is produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium. This one is highly toxic to the kidneys and is a major immune suppressor. It actually disrupts mitochondrial function by inhibiting a specific enzyme called phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase. Basically, it stops your cells from making the proteins they need to function. Then there is Aflatoxin M1. This is a potent carcinogen for the liver. If you see high levels of this, you know the liver is under massive stress and its Phase two glucuronidation pathways are likely struggling. And finally, we have the Trichothecenes, like Satratoxin. These are produced by Stachybotrys, or what we commonly call black mold. These are extremely toxic and can actually stop protein synthesis at the cellular level.

I want to share a story about a client named Linda. She was a school educator who had been struggling for over ten years. She had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. She had seen every specialist in the city. When we did her testing, her mycotoxin levels were off the charts. It turned out her school's old ventilation system was full of black mold. By identifying that source and implementing a strategic binder rotation protocol, Linda saw a seventy percent reduction in her symptoms within just four months. That is the power of what you are learning. As a certified practitioner, you provide the legitimacy and the answers that these women have been seeking for decades.

So, how do we actually get these toxins out? This brings us to designing multi-phase detoxification protocols. The biggest mistake I see coaches make is what I call "mobilizing without binding." If you pull toxins out of the tissues but you don't have anything in the gut to catch them, they just re-circulate. This is called enterohepatic circulation. The toxins go from the liver, into the bile, into the small intestine, and then they get re-absorbed right back into the blood. Often, they end up settling in the brain, which makes the client feel ten times worse.

This is why we use the binder rotation strategy. Different toxins have different affinities for different binders. It is like using the right key for a specific lock. Activated charcoal is a great broad-spectrum binder. it is excellent for gaseous toxins and acute exposures. Then we have bentonite or zeolite clay. These have a very strong electrical charge that has a high affinity for heavy metals and Aflatoxin. Chlorella is another favorite of mine. It specifically binds metals like mercury and lead, and it also provides chlorophyll to support the blood. In some cases, especially with CIRS or high Ochratoxin, we might even need prescription binders like Cholestyramine or Welchol. By rotating these, we ensure a "clean sweep" of the entire GI tract.

We also have to talk about Phase three detoxification. We often talk about Phase one and Phase two in the liver, but Phase three is just as important. These are the antiporters, like P-glycoprotein, that act as pumps to push toxins out of the cell. If Phase three is blocked—which happens a lot when there is high inflammation or if the client is on certain medications—Phase one and Phase two will back up. It is like a traffic jam. This is why people get those terrible "detox reactions." To support Phase three, we always want to ensure bile flow is moving. I love using TUDCA or bitter herbs to keep that bile thin and flowing.

In many of your advanced cases, the client's GI tract is going to be a mess. They might have leaky gut, SIBO, or just general malabsorption. This is where liposomal delivery systems and IV nutrient therapy become game changers. Liposomal glutathione is a perfect example. Glutathione is our master antioxidant, but if you take it in a regular capsule, the stomach acid usually destroys it. By encapsulating it in phospholipids, we allow it to bypass the stomach and get absorbed directly into the lymphatic system. This is crucial for protecting the liver while we are moving heavy metals.

And for those clients who really need a push, IV nutrient therapy is incredible. High-dose Vitamin C, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, and even IV chelation with EDTA or DMPS can achieve serum levels that oral supplements just can't match. Now, as a coach, you might not be the one hanging the IV bag, but you can partner with a medical director or a local IV clinic. This creates a high-ticket, collaborative care model that provides your clients with the best possible outcomes while positioning you as the lead strategist in their care.

But before we do any of that, we have to talk about the "Optimize" phase. I cannot stress this enough: Never, ever initiate chelation or aggressive mycotoxin binding in a client who is constipated. The emunctories, which are the organs of elimination, must be wide open. If the exit doors are locked, you are just stirring up a hornets' nest inside the body.

First, we look at bowel regularity. We need one to two complete bowel movements every single day. If we need to use magnesium citrate or triphala to get things moving, we do it. Remember, toxins bound to bile must exit the body via the stool. If they sit in the colon for too long, they will be re-absorbed. Second, we look at renal support. Hydration with electrolytes is non-negotiable. Metals like cadmium are notoriously hard on the kidneys, so we might consider adding N-Acetyl Cysteine for extra renal protection. And third, we use the skin and the lymph. Incorporate dry brushing and infrared saunas. I often tell my clients that the skin is their "third kidney." It is a vital exit route for those fat-loving mycotoxins.

I want you to realize that these advanced environmental protocols are high-value services. When you can take a client through a comprehensive six-month "Toxic Burden Resolution" package, you are looking at a program that can easily range from twenty-five hundred to five thousand dollars. For a practitioner who might be transitioning from a sixty-thousand-dollar-a-year nursing job, just two or three new clients a month at this level can double your previous income. But more importantly, it allows you to provide the kind of deep healing that most of the medical system is simply ignoring.

When you are explaining these complex ideas to your clients, I want you to use what I call the "Renovation Analogy." Tell them: "We are doing a deep-clean of your cellular house. We can't just start scrubbing the floors, which is Phase one and two, if the trash cans are already full and the front doors are locked. We have to open the doors and empty the trash cans first—that's your Phase three and your elimination organs—so that when we do start cleaning, the trash actually leaves the building instead of just getting pushed into the corners." This helps them understand why we might spend the first month just focused on their digestion and hydration before we ever touch a binder or a chelator.

So, let's recap the key takeaways from today. First, we have to reveal the total burden. Don't rely on basic blood markers for chronic issues; use provocation testing to see what is hidden in the tissues. Second, remember the mycotoxin connection. These toxins love fat, they cross into the brain, and Ochratoxin A is a very common driver of that "unexplained" fatigue we see so often. Third, it is always emunctories first. Optimize the bowels, the kidneys, and the skin before you start moving toxins to prevent "re-toxing" the client. Fourth, be strategic with your binding. Use a rotation of charcoal, clay, and chlorella to address the different chemical affinities of various toxins. And fifth, don't be afraid to use advanced delivery systems like liposomal glutathione or IV support for those clients with compromised absorption.

I want to spend a few more minutes on the "why" behind some of these choices, because as an expert, your clients will ask you questions. They might ask, "Why can't I just take a multivitamin and a green powder?" You need to be able to explain that heavy metals like lead and mercury actually displace essential minerals. Lead is a "calcium mimic." It sits in the receptors where calcium should be, which is why it messes with bone density and nerve signaling. Mercury is a "zinc and selenium mimic." It interferes with the enzymes that convert T4 to T3, which is why so many "hypothyroid" patients actually have a mercury problem. When you explain it this way, they understand that we aren't just "detoxing," we are restoring the basic biochemical machinery of their bodies.

Also, think about the emotional journey of these clients. Many of them have been told that their symptoms are "just stress" or "part of getting older." When you show them a test result that proves they have a high burden of Ochratoxin A or Lead, you are giving them their power back. You are validating their experience. That validation is often the first step in the healing process. It shifts them from a state of "I'm broken" to "I have a plan."

As you move forward, I want you to start looking at your current clients through this lens. If you have a client who has been doing everything right but their progress has stalled, ask yourself: Are the exit doors open? Is there a hidden toxic burden? Have we looked at their environment? Sometimes the "cleanest" eaters are the ones most affected because they are so focused on what goes in that they forget to look at what is already there or what they are breathing in.

I also want to touch on the importance of the liver's Phase two pathways again. We mentioned glucuronidation earlier. This is the pathway that handles Aflatoxin, but it also handles estrogen. This is why you will often see women with mold toxicity also struggling with severe PMS or estrogen dominance. The liver is so busy trying to deal with the mycotoxins that it lets the estrogen hormones pile up. By clearing the toxic burden, you often solve the hormonal issues without ever having to use a single hormone supplement. That is the beauty of functional medicine—everything is connected.

Lastly, let's talk about the skin. I mentioned the infrared sauna. This isn't just a luxury; it is a clinical tool. Research shows that certain toxins, like arsenic and cadmium, are actually excreted at higher concentrations in sweat than in urine. For a client whose kidneys are struggling, the sauna can be a literal lifesaver. Just make sure they are replenishing their electrolytes and using a binder about thirty minutes before they get in, so that any toxins released into the gut are caught immediately.

You are doing incredible work by mastering these concepts. This isn't easy material, but it is the material that changes lives. It is what separates a "health coach" from a "Functional Medicine Practitioner." You are learning to see the invisible, and that makes you an invaluable asset to your clients.

Take some time to review your notes on the different binders and the specific mycotoxins we discussed. Think about how you can start incorporating the "Optimize" phase into your initial client onboarding. The more you prepare the body, the smoother the entire process will be.

Great work today. You are becoming the expert your clients have been praying for. I will see you in the next lesson where we will continue to build on this foundation. Until then, keep digging for those root causes and remember that true healing starts with a clear path. See you soon.
