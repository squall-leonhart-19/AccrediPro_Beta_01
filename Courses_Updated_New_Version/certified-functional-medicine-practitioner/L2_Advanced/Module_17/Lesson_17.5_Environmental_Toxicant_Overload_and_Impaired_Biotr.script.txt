Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you are joining me for this lesson. We are moving into some of the most transformative work you will ever do with your clients. In our last lesson, we took a deep dive into the worlds of CIRS and MCAS. We looked at how the immune system can become hyper-reactive and stay stuck in a state of high alert. But today, we are going to look at what is often the actual fuel for that fire. We are talking about the total toxic burden.

If you want to truly unlock those stuck cases, the ones where the client is doing everything right but still not getting better, you have to understand biotransformation. This is the key. We are going to move beyond the basic detox ideas you see in health magazines and look at the advanced science of how the body actually processes and removes modern poisons.

I want to start by being very honest about the world we live in. We are essentially swimming in a chemical soup. Right now, there are over 80,000 synthetic compounds registered for use in the United States. Many of these have never been tested for long-term human safety, especially not in the combinations we encounter them. For so many of your clients, the lead domino in their health collapse is not a lack of vitamins or a bad diet. It is an accumulation of environmental toxicants that their body simply can no longer process.

In this lesson, I am going to teach you how to identify this burden using clinical history and functional markers. We are going to master the four phases of biotransformation. We will spend a lot of time on Phase 2.5, which is bile flow, and Phase 3, which is elimination. These are the two phases most people skip, and it is exactly why so many detox programs fail. We will also look at the genetics behind this, specifically MTHFR, COMT, and GST. Finally, I will help you build a sequenced protocol that avoids that terrible Herxheimer trap where the client feels worse before they feel better.

Let’s start with a story that I think will resonate with you. I want to tell you about a client named Sarah. She was an educator, a woman who had spent twenty years teaching in an older school building. By the time she came to see me, she was completely burned out. She was dealing with fibromyalgia and brain fog that was so severe she actually started forgetting her students' names. She was also incredibly sensitive to chemicals. If she walked down the laundry detergent aisle at the grocery store, she would get a migraine that lasted for two days.

Sarah had seen everyone. She had a clean diet. She was taking dozens of supplements. But she was still bedridden at least two days a week. When we looked at her conventional labs, everything looked normal. Her doctor told her she was just stressed. But when we ran functional testing, we found the real story. She had elevated mercury from a lifetime of amalgam fillings and a high-fish diet. She had high levels of Ochratoxin A, which is a common mold toxin. And she had a double MTHFR mutation.

Her cup was not just full; it was overflowing. The reason she had failed with other practitioners is that they tried to push her liver to detox without checking if her exit doors were open. They gave her binders and glutathione right away, which caused her to flare. In our work together, we focused on Phase 2.5, her bile flow, before we did anything else. That was the secret to her recovery.

This brings us to the Cup Analogy. This is how I want you to explain this to your clients. Imagine every person is born with a cup. That cup represents your genetic capacity to detoxify. Some people have a huge gallon-sized bucket. They can smoke, eat junk, and live in a polluted city and seem fine for decades. Other people are born with a tiny espresso cup. They are much more sensitive.

Throughout our lives, we pour things into that cup. We pour in heavy metals from our water and food. We pour in plastics like BPA and phthalates. We add pesticides like glyphosate. We add mold toxins from our homes and offices. As long as the liquid stays inside the cup, the person usually feels okay. But the moment that cup overflows, that is when we see the "unexplained" symptoms. That is when the brain fog, the joint pain, and the fatigue take over.

A very important study published in Nature in 2022 suggested that environmental factors contribute to as much as 70 to 90 percent of chronic disease risk. Think about that. Most of what we are dealing with isn't just "bad luck" or "bad genes." It is the environment. This is why specializing in environmental toxicant overload is so valuable. Practitioners in our community who master this often charge between $2,500 and $5,000 for a four-month "Toxic Burden Reset." Why? Because you are providing the deep investigation and the clinical results that people simply cannot find in the standard insurance-based medical model.

Now, let's talk about the actual science of how the body gets rid of these toxins. Most people have heard of Phase 1 and Phase 2 detoxification in the liver. But in complex functional cases, the bottleneck usually happens in Phase 2.5 and Phase 3. Let's walk through all of them so you can see the whole picture.

Phase 1 is called Activation. This is where the Cytochrome P450 enzymes take a toxin and essentially "unlock" it. It uses oxidation to make the toxin more reactive. To do this well, the body needs B-vitamins, glutathione, and flavonoids. But here is the catch: once a toxin is activated in Phase 1, it is actually more dangerous and more reactive than it was before. It is like taking the pin out of a grenade. You don't want to leave it there.

That is where Phase 2 comes in. This is Conjugation. The body takes that "activated" toxin and attaches a molecule to it, like an amino acid or a sulfur group, to make it water-soluble. This process requires things like glycine, taurine, NAC, and sulfur. Now the grenade has been put in a protective box. It is ready to leave the body.

But this is where most protocols fail. They focus on Phase 1 and 2, but they ignore Phase 2.5. Phase 2.5 is all about bile flow and transport. Once the liver has processed the toxin, it has to get that toxin into the bile so it can be sent to the intestines. If the bile is thick and sluggish, or if the transport proteins aren't working, those toxins get stuck. They sit in the liver or, worse, they get reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. This is called enterohepatic circulation. It is like a revolving door. The toxin goes out, but then it comes right back in. This is why your clients feel incredibly sick when they start a detox. They aren't actually detoxing; they are just recycling toxins.

To support Phase 2.5, we use things like TUDCA, which thins the bile, along with choline, phosphatidylcholine, and artichoke extract. We want that bile flowing like thin olive oil, not thick molasses.

Finally, we have Phase 3, which is Elimination. This is the actual exit from the body through stool, urine, and sweat. This requires fiber, proper hydration, and sometimes the use of binders. If your client is constipated, they cannot detox. It is that simple. If they aren't having one or two healthy bowel movements a day, any toxins the liver dumps into the gut will just sit there and get reabsorbed through the gut lining.

This leads us to the big debate in the functional medicine world: do you fix the gut first, or do you clear the toxins first? In our R.O.O.T.S. Method, we almost always follow the rule of "Optimize the Gut" before we "Target the Toxins." Here is why. If the gut is "leaky," meaning there is high intestinal permeability, the toxins you are trying to clear will just leak back into systemic circulation. This can cause a massive inflammatory flare, especially if the client has MCAS or CIRS. You are essentially stirring up a hornets' nest.

However, there is an exception. Sometimes we go "Detox-First" if the toxins themselves are the primary cause of the gut dysfunction. For example, heavy metals can inhibit digestive enzymes, and certain mold toxins can actually paralyze gut motility. If the gut isn't moving because the toxins are stopping it, we have to use "Gentle Drainage" support for Phase 2.5 and Phase 3 while we work on the gut. It is a delicate balance.

Now, let's talk about genetics. We never treat a SNP, or a single nucleotide polymorphism, in isolation. We treat the person, not the gene. But these SNPs provide a blueprint of where a client might be vulnerable. There are three that are non-negotiable in complex cases.

The first is MTHFR. You have probably heard of this one. It affects how the body produces methyl groups. Methylation is required for Phase 2 detox and for DNA repair. If a client has an MTHFR mutation, they might need more support with methylated B-vitamins.

The second is COMT. This gene is responsible for breaking down estrogens and stress hormones like adrenaline and dopamine. If a client has a "slow" COMT gene, they don't clear these hormones quickly. This can lead to estrogen dominance and a lot of anxiety or "jitters" during a detox program. Knowing this allows you to adjust their protocol to be much more gentle.

The third is GST, or Glutathione S-Transferase. I like to call this the "velcro" gene. It is the enzyme that actually attaches glutathione to a toxin so it can be carried out. If a client has deletions in their GST genes, they are at a much higher risk for heavy metal accumulation because their "velcro" isn't as sticky.

When my client Sarah saw her MTHFR results, she was really scared. She thought she was broken. I told her what I tell all my clients: "Genetics load the gun, but the environment pulls the trigger. Your genes just tell us that we need to be extra supportive of your pathways." That shifted her from feeling like a victim to feeling empowered. She realized she just needed a different set of tools.

So, how do we actually do this? In the Target phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method, we use what I call the "Push-Catch" strategy.

The "Push" involves using things like liposomal glutathione and NAC. These nutrients mobilize toxins. They pull them out of the tissues and move them into the liver and the bile. But you can't just push. If you just push, the toxins end up floating around the gut.

That is why we need the "Catch." The catch involves using specialized binders like activated charcoal, bentonite clay, zeolite, or modified citrus pectin. We usually have the client take the binder about 30 to 60 minutes after the "push." The binder acts like a sponge in the gut, soaking up those toxins so they can be carried out in the stool. This prevents the toxins from being reabsorbed and keeps the client from feeling like they have the flu.

I have a very important coach tip for you here. Never, ever start a detox protocol until you are sure the client is having regular bowel movements. Constipation during a detox is a recipe for disaster. It is like trying to clean a house with all the doors and windows welded shut. If they are backed up, use magnesium citrate or buffered Vitamin C to "open the pipes" before you start any mobilization.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with five key takeaways that you can start using with your clients right away.

First, remember the Cup Analogy. Your clinical success depends on two things: lowering the total toxic burden and increasing the capacity of that cup. You have to do both.

Second, always open the exit doors first. You never start a detox until Phase 3, which is bowel movements and hydration, and Phase 2.5, which is bile flow, are optimized. This is the secret to avoiding the Herxheimer reaction.

Third, remember that genetics are maps, not destinies. Use MTHFR and COMT results to personalize the nutrients, like choosing between methylated and non-methylated B-vitamins, but don't let the client feel defined by their SNPs.

Fourth, sequence is queen. Use the R.O.O.T.S. Method to make sure the gut is stable before you start aggressively moving heavy metals or mold toxins. A stable gut makes for a much smoother detox.

And fifth, always use the "Push-Catch" method. Pair your liposomal glutathione with a high-quality binder to minimize systemic inflammation and keep the toxins moving in the right direction—out of the body.

I want to challenge you to think about your current clients. Is there someone who has plateaued? Someone who eats perfectly but still has brain fog or joint pain? They might be the perfect candidate for a toxic burden assessment. When you can help someone like Sarah get her life back, when she can go back to her classroom and remember her students' names and feel vibrant again, that is when you know you are doing true functional medicine.

You are doing great work. This is complex stuff, but you are mastering it piece by piece. I will see you in the next lesson where we will continue to build on these foundations. Keep going, and I will talk to you soon.
