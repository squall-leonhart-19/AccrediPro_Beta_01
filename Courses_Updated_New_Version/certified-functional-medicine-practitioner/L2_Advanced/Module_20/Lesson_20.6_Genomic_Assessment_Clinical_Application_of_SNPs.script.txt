Hi, it is Sarah. Welcome back. I am so glad you are here for this specific lesson because we are about to step into what I truly believe is the frontier of personalized medicine. Up until this point in the course, we have spent a lot of time talking about functional biomarkers. We have looked at blood chemistry, we have looked at gut health, and we have looked at hormones. Those markers are incredibly important because they tell us what is happening in your client’s body right now. They are the snapshot of the present moment. But today, we are going to look at something different. We are going to look at the biological blueprint. We are going to talk about genomic assessment.

This is the ultimate tool for personalizing what we call the Sustain phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method. If the first phases of our work are about digging up the roots and clearing the soil, the Sustain phase is about building a fence around that garden to make sure it stays healthy for the next thirty, forty, or fifty years. Genomic testing allows you to move beyond general best practices. You no longer have to tell a client that a certain supplement is good because the research says so. Instead, you can tell them that this specific intervention is necessary because their unique genetic code requires it. When you can do that, you move into the realm of exact practices. This level of precision is exactly why genomic consultations command such premium rates in the functional medicine world. It is not uncommon for practitioners to charge three hundred and fifty to five hundred dollars for a single genomic review session.

In this lesson, I want to help you master five key areas. First, we are going to clear up the confusion between genotype and phenotype. This is the foundation of everything. Second, we will dive into the power players of methylation and detoxification, specifically looking at SNPs like MTHFR and GST. Third, we are going to look at how genetics influence the brain and the immune system through COMT and VDR variations. Fourth, I will show you how to build a Sustain strategy that identifies a client’s unique weak links. And finally, we will talk about the ethics of this work. We have to make sure we are empowering our clients, not giving them a reason to feel like they are victims of their DNA.

Let’s start with the big picture. One of the most common mistakes I see new practitioners make is that they start treating the DNA sequence itself. They see a positive result on a test and they immediately jump to a supplement. But in functional medicine, we have a saying that I want you to memorize: Genetics loads the gun, but the environment pulls the trigger.

Think about the genotype as the hardwired code. This is your DNA. It is the blueprint of the house. If the blueprint shows a small foundation, that is a potential vulnerability. But that vulnerability only becomes a problem if you try to build a massive skyscraper on top of it. The actual expression of that code is what we call the phenotype. The phenotype is the observable characteristic. It is the current state of health. It is the high homocysteine level or the chronic brain fog.

The bridge between these two is epigenetics. These are the biochemical switches that flip gene expression on or off based on lifestyle, diet, stress, and environment. When you explain this to your clients, I find it really helpful to use a financial analogy. Tell them that their genes are like a monthly budget. Some people are born with a very large budget for processing stress or clearing toxins. They can stay up late, eat junk food, and live in a polluted city, and they seem fine because they have the "money" to spend. Other people have a very tight budget. Their enzymes work a little slower. Genomic testing tells us where their budget is tight so we can make sure they do not overspend in those specific areas.

Now, there are over ten million Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, or SNPs, in the human genome. You cannot possibly look at all of them, and frankly, most of them do not matter clinically. As a practitioner, you have to be a filter for your client. We focus on SNPs that have high penetrance and, most importantly, actionable interventions.

The first one we have to talk about is MTHFR. You have probably heard of this one because it is the most famous SNP in the wellness world. MTHFR stands for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. It is the rate-limiting enzyme in the methyl cycle. Think of methylation as a massive cellular assembly line that happens billions of times every second. It is how your body repairs DNA, how it makes neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and how it processes toxins.

Variations like the C677T or the A1298C can reduce the efficiency of this enzyme by anywhere from thirty to seventy percent. Research from 2021 actually showed that individuals with the homozygous C677T variant have a significantly higher risk of elevated homocysteine. If you remember from our earlier lessons, high homocysteine is a major red flag for cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. But here is the key: having the MTHFR gene does not mean you are sick. It means you have a higher requirement for folate. It means your assembly line needs more high-quality raw materials to keep up with the demand.

Next, let’s look at the GST family of genes. These govern the Phase Two conjugation of toxins with glutathione. This is where your body actually grabs onto a toxin and prepares it to be escorted out of the building. Some people have what we call a GSTM1 Null genotype. This means they actually lack this specific enzyme entirely. It is not just slow; it is absent. If you have a client with this genotype living in a high-pollution area or a home with mold, they are going to be much more susceptible to illness than someone else. Their body simply does not have the machinery to clear those specific threats effectively.

Then we have TNF-alpha. This SNP governs the volume of the inflammatory response. I like to think of it like a volume knob on a stereo. If a client has the TNF-alpha 308 variation, their volume knob is stuck on high. When they encounter an inflammatory stimulus, like a high-sugar meal or a stressful event, their body overreacts. They produce way more inflammation than the average person. For these clients, a standard healthy diet might not be enough. They require aggressive, lifelong anti-inflammatory support because their genetic default is to turn up the heat.

I want to tell you a story about a client named Sarah to show you how this looks in the real world. Sarah was a forty-six-year-old corporate attorney. She came to me with terrible brain fog and exercise intolerance. She told me she felt toxic all the time, which was frustrating because she ate a very clean, organic diet and did everything right. When we ran her genomics, we found that she was GSTM1 Null, meaning she lacked that key detox enzyme, and she had one copy of the MTHFR C677T mutation.

It turned out Sarah was living in a home with a very low level of mold. Her husband felt completely fine, so she thought she was just going crazy. But because of her genetics, her body couldn’t keep up with even a small amount of mold exposure. Her detox budget was being overspent every single day. Instead of giving her general wellness advice, we implemented high-dose liposomal glutathione and specific methylated B-vitamins to support her methylation. We also got her a high-quality air filtration system. Within four weeks, her brain fog was gone. She was so impressed that she now pays a monthly retainer for what she calls genomic maintenance. She knows her career is high-stress, and she uses the data we found to make sure she never overspends her biological budget again.

Now, let’s talk about the brain and the immune system. This is where genomics gets really fascinating for clients because it explains their personality and their daily experience of the world. We look at a gene called COMT. This gene breaks down catecholamines like dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. We generally see two phenotypes here.

The first is the Fast COMT, which we often call the Warrior. These people clear dopamine very quickly. They are the ones who perform incredibly well under high pressure. They are calm in a crisis. However, when things are quiet and low-stress, they might struggle with focus or even feel a bit depressed because their dopamine levels drop too low.

On the other side, we have the Slow COMT, or the Worrier. These people clear dopamine very slowly. They are often highly focused, creative, and detail-oriented. But because they keep dopamine in their system longer, they are much more prone to anxiety and OCD-like tendencies when stress levels rise. When a client learns that their tendency toward anxiety is actually a biological byproduct of how they process dopamine, it removes so much shame. It is not a character flaw; it is just a metabolic reality that we can manage with the right nutrients and lifestyle shifts.

We also have to look at the VDR gene, which stands for the Vitamin D Receptor. This gene determines how effectively your cells can actually grab and use Vitamin D. You might have a client whose blood levels of Vitamin D look totally normal on a standard lab test, say around thirty nanograms per milliliter. But if they have a VDR Taq or Fok variation, their receptors are inefficient. They are like a lock that is a little bit rusty; you need more pressure to get the key to turn. These clients often need their blood levels to be much higher, maybe in the seventy to ninety range, just to feel okay. They might have bone loss or poor immunity even when their doctor says their labs are fine. This is why genomic data is so powerful. It changes how we interpret standard labs.

All of this data feeds into what I call the Sustain strategy. In the R.O.O.T.S. Method, the Sustain phase is about long-term resilience. We want to identify the weak links in a client’s chain. For example, if we see a variation in the SOD2 gene, we know that client’s mitochondria are less protected from oxidative stress. Their Sustain plan will always include a lifelong emphasis on antioxidant-rich foods and maybe specific mitochondrial supports like CoQ10, especially during times of high stress. We are giving them a personalized user manual for their body.

However, as we do this work, we have to be very careful about ethical considerations. There is a trap called genetic fatalism. This is the belief that because a gene is present, a disease is inevitable. We must never, ever tell a client, "You have the gene for Alzheimer's." That is not only inaccurate, it is harmful. Instead, we use empowering language. We say, "You have a variation that suggests your brain requires more DHA and very specific sleep hygiene to stay healthy long-term." We are giving them the tools to change the outcome.

Also, remember that you should never diagnose based on SNPs alone. Genomic data must always be correlated with functional labs. If you see an MTHFR variation, you check the homocysteine. If you see a VDR variation, you check the Vitamin D and the clinical symptoms. We only intervene when we see that the gene is actually misbehaving in the phenotype.

To wrap things up, I want to leave you with four key takeaways. First, remember that genes are not destiny. They are a blueprint, but epigenetics is the architect. Second, stay focused on actionable SNPs. Don’t get lost in the weeds of ten thousand markers that don't change your clinical plan. Focus on methylation, detox, inflammation, mood, and Vitamin D. Third, always correlate your findings with labs. Never use genomic data in isolation. And finally, always use this information to empower your clients. Your goal is to provide them with a personalized strategy that makes them feel in control of their health, not afraid of it.

You are doing great work. This is a lot of complex information, but as you start to apply it, you will see how it transforms your results with clients. It takes you from being a coach to being a true specialist. I will see you in the next lesson.
