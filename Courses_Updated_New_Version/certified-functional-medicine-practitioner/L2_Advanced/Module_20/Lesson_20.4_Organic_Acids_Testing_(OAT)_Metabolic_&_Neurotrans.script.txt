Hi, it’s Sarah. In this lesson, we are going to dive deep into one of the most transformative tools in your functional medicine toolkit. We’re talking about the Organic Acids Test, or the OAT. If you’ve been following along in our curriculum, you know we’ve already explored things like stool analysis and DUTCH testing. Those are incredible tools. Stool testing tells us the "who" is living in the microbiome. DUTCH testing reveals the "signals" or the hormones. But the OAT is different. The OAT reveals the "how." It shows us how your client’s cells are actually functioning at the deep, biochemical level.

I like to think of the OAT as a liquid biopsy of the body’s metabolism. It is particularly powerful for those clients who come to you feeling completely stuck. You know the ones. They are often women in their 40s or 50s. They tell you they feel exhausted. They have debilitating brain fog. They feel like they’re walking through mud every single day. They go to their primary care doctor, get standard blood work done, and everything comes back "normal." Their doctor tells them they’re just getting older or maybe they’re just stressed. But they know something is wrong. The OAT is often the first time these clients see definitive evidence of why their energy production has stalled. Today, we’re moving beyond just managing symptoms. We are diving into the Krebs cycle, neurotransmitter turnover, and hidden dysbiosis.

By the end of our time together today, you’re going to be able to do five key things. First, you’ll identify metabolic blocks in the Krebs cycle using specific organic acid patterns. Second, you’ll learn how to analyze neurotransmitter metabolites to see if neuroinflammation is driving a client's mood disorder. Third, you’ll be able to detect fungal and bacterial markers that standard stool tests often miss. Fourth, you’ll be able to determine exactly which B-vitamins or co-factors like CoQ10 a client needs based on their unique enzymatic patterns. And finally, you’ll learn how to synthesize all this OAT data into the Reveal phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method for your most complex clients.

So, let’s start with the basics. What exactly is an organic acid? Think of organic acids as metabolic byproducts that are excreted in the urine. I always use the car engine analogy with my clients. Imagine a car engine running. As it burns fuel, it produces exhaust. By looking at the chemical composition of that exhaust, a mechanic can tell exactly where the engine is failing. Is it burning too much oil? Is the fuel-to-air ratio off? The OAT is that exhaust analysis for the human cell. When we see an organic acid is elevated in the urine, it usually tells us there is a "block" in a metabolic pathway. This block could be caused by a nutrient deficiency, a toxic inhibition from something like heavy metals, or even a genetic SNP that makes an enzyme work more slowly.

I often tell my clients that standard blood work looks at the parts of the car. It checks the tires and the battery. But the OAT looks at the fuel efficiency. It tells us if your cells are actually using the nutrients you’re eating to create energy. Or are they getting stuck along the way? This analogy is so helpful because it immediately validates their experience. It explains why they can eat a "perfect" diet and still feel like they have zero gas in the tank.

Now, let’s talk about bioenergetics. This is the heart of the OAT. We have to talk about the Krebs cycle, also known as the Citric Acid Cycle. This is the centerpiece of cellular energy production. Research shows that mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary driver in over 70 percent of chronic fatigue cases. When you look at an OAT, you are looking for specific markers that tell you where this cycle is broken.

Let’s look at some specific markers you’ll see. If you see elevations in Citrate or Isocitrate, that often points to a block in the very early stages of the Krebs cycle. In my experience, this is frequently linked to heavy metal toxicity. If a client has high levels of Lead or Mercury, it can actually "gunk up" the enzymes at the start of the cycle. In these cases, we don’t just give more nutrients; we have to support glutathione and look into detoxification.

Then we have Succinate. If Succinate is high, it’s a classic sign that the body is low on Riboflavin, which is Vitamin B2, or CoQ10. These two nutrients are the "spark plugs" for the enzyme that processes Succinate. If they aren't there, Succinate builds up and spills into the urine. For these clients, adding a high-quality B-complex and maybe 200 to 400 milligrams of CoQ10 can be a total game-changer for their physical stamina.

If you see Fumarate or Malate elevated, that’s usually a sign of more severe mitochondrial stress. This often happens when a client has been depleted for a long time. They might need even higher doses of CoQ10 or perhaps Acetyl-L-Carnitine to help shuttle fats into the mitochondria for fuel. 

And then there’s Lactate. When Lactate is high, it means the body is shifting from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism. It’s like the body is trying to run a marathon but it’s stuck in "sprint" mode. This is a huge red flag for oxidative stress. Usually, we look at Thiamine, or Vitamin B1, to help pull the body back into efficient energy production.

Let's move into one of the most fascinating parts of the OAT: the Neuro-Metabolic Connection. A lot of people try to test neurotransmitters in the blood, but that’s actually not very accurate for what’s happening in the brain. The OAT is different. It measures metabolites, which are the breakdown products of neurotransmitters. This gives us a window into what we call the Neuro-Endocrine node of the Functional Medicine Matrix.

First, let’s talk about the catecholamine markers, HVA and VMA. HVA is the byproduct of Dopamine. VMA is the byproduct of Norepinephrine and Epinephrine. When these are very high, it tells me the client is in a chronic "fight or flight" state. Their nervous system is constantly stuck in the "on" position. On the flip side, if these are very low, we see what we call "reward deficiency." These are the clients who struggle with ADHD, or they feel a deep sense of apathy and depression. They literally don't have enough dopamine turnover to feel motivated.

But the real "smoking gun" on the OAT is often the Kynurenine pathway, specifically Quinolinic Acid. This is a potent neurotoxin. Here’s what happens: Normally, the body uses the amino acid Tryptophan to make Serotonin. Serotonin makes us feel happy and calm. But when the body is under systemic inflammation, it "shunts" that Tryptophan away. Instead of making Serotonin, it follows the Kynurenine pathway to make Quinolinic Acid. 

This is what we call the "Tryptophan Steal." This is exactly why inflamed clients feel depressed. They aren't "weak" and they don't necessarily have a "prozac deficiency." They are literally stealing their own Serotonin to fuel neuroinflammation. When Quinolinic Acid is high, it can actually overstimulate the brain's receptors, leading to brain fog and even nerve cell death over time.

I want to share a story about a client named Sarah. She was a 48-year-old former teacher. She came to me because her brain fog was so bad she was actually afraid to drive. She felt like she was losing her mind. Her doctor suggested antidepressants, but she knew that wasn't the answer. Her standard blood work was pristine. Her TSH was fine, her CBC was perfect. But when we ran her OAT, everything changed.

Sarah had massive elevations in Quinolinic Acid. Her brain was literally on fire with inflammation. She also had high levels of Arabinose, which is a marker for yeast overgrowth. And her Succinate was high, meaning her mitochondria were starving for B2 and CoQ10. We didn't give her a "brain supplement." Instead, we addressed the yeast overgrowth in her gut with botanicals. We added Vitamin B6 to help clear that Quinolinic acid, and we started her on 400 milligrams of Ubiquinol. Within six weeks, Sarah told me her "brain turned back on." She was so inspired by her recovery that she actually started her own part-time health coaching practice. She’s now helping other teachers and earned over $2,500 in her first quarter. That is the power of finding the root cause.

Now, let’s talk about the gut. You might be wondering, "Sarah, if I’m already doing stool testing, why do I need the OAT for the gut?" It’s a great question. Stool tests are excellent for mapping the large intestine. But they often miss what’s happening higher up in the digestive tract, in the small intestine. This is where the OAT shines, especially for detecting SIFO, or Small Intestinal Fungal Overgrowth.

One of the main markers we look for is Arabinitol, often listed as Arabinose. This is a sugar alcohol produced specifically by Candida albicans. If you see high Arabinose, you can almost guarantee the client is struggling with brain fog and intense sugar cravings. I always tell my clients, "Your sugar cravings aren't a lack of willpower. They are a biological demand from the yeast overgrowth in your gut." When you say that to a client, you can see the shame lift off their shoulders. They realize it’s not their fault, which makes them so much more likely to stick to the protocol.

Another marker is Tartaric Acid. This is often elevated when there is Aspergillus or Candida present. The problem with Tartaric Acid is that it can actually inhibit the Krebs cycle. So, the yeast in the gut is literally poisoning the energy production in the cells. It’s a double whammy of fatigue.

We also look for HPHPA. This is a marker for Clostridia species. This is a big one for mood. High HPHPA can inhibit the enzyme that converts Dopamine to Norepinephrine. When that happens, Dopamine builds up to toxic levels, which can lead to intense anxiety, irritability, and even behavioral issues. If you have a client who is "wired and tired" or feels constantly on edge, check that Clostridia marker.

Next, let’s talk about nutritional co-factor analysis. The OAT is arguably the best test we have for assessing functional B-vitamin status. In standard medicine, we might measure how much B12 is in the blood. But that doesn't tell us if the B12 is actually getting inside the cell where it’s needed. The OAT measures Methylmalonic Acid, or MMA. If MMA is high, it means the body functionally lacks B12 at the cellular level, even if the blood levels look "normal."

We also look at Xanthurenic Acid for Vitamin B6 status. We look at Glutaric Acid for Vitamin B2 status. And we look at Pyroglutamic Acid for Glutathione status. Glutathione is our master antioxidant. If Pyroglutamic acid is too high or too low, it’s a sign that the client’s detoxification system is overwhelmed. They likely need N-Acetyl Cysteine or liposomal glutathione to get back on track.

So, how do we bring all of this together? In our R.O.O.T.S. Method, the OAT acts as the "Master Map" during the Reveal phase. It allows you to organize your findings into the different nodes of the Functional Medicine Matrix. 

For the Energy Node, you look at the Krebs cycle markers and fatty acid metabolism. For the Biotransformation Node, you look at those glutathione markers and detoxification indicators. For the Assimilation Node, you’re looking at the bacterial and fungal dysbiosis markers. And for the Communication Node, you’re looking at the neurotransmitter metabolites and neuroinflammation.

I know that for many of you who are career changers, interpreting an OAT can feel a bit intimidating at first. There’s a lot of biochemistry involved. But I want to encourage you: mastering this test is exactly what separates a "wellness enthusiast" from a true "Functional Medicine Practitioner." When you can sit down with a client and explain the "why" behind their fatigue using their own biochemical data, your authority and value skyrocket. A single OAT interpretation session can easily command $350 to $500. This not only provides the financial freedom you’re looking for, but it delivers the kind of life-changing results that keep your practice full of referrals.

Before we wrap up, let’s do a quick mental check of what we’ve covered. Think about why Quinolinic Acid is so critical for those clients with depression and brain fog. Remember the "Tryptophan Steal." If you see high Succinate, what nutrients should you be thinking about? That’s right, B2 and CoQ10. Remember that MMA is our gold standard for B12, not the serum levels. And finally, remember that the OAT catches the fungal overgrowth in the small intestine that stool tests might miss.

To summarize our key takeaways for today: 
First, the OAT is your metabolic snapshot. It shows you cellular energy, neurotransmitter turnover, and gut health all in one place. 
Second, treat elevations as "metabolic blocks." They are clues pointing toward nutrient deficiencies, toxins, or hidden inflammation. 
Third, pay close attention to Quinolinic Acid. It is your primary marker for neuroinflammation. 
Fourth, don't ignore Arabinose and Tartaric Acid. They are your best tools for identifying hidden SIFO. 
And fifth, always trust the functional markers like MMA and Xanthurenic Acid over standard serum levels for B-vitamins.

You are doing incredible work. I know this was a deep dive into the "weeds" of biochemistry, but these are the tools that change lives. When you can see the invisible blocks holding your clients back, you become an unstoppable force for their healing.

Great work today. I’m so proud of the practitioner you are becoming. Keep studying, keep curious, and I will see you in the next lesson.
