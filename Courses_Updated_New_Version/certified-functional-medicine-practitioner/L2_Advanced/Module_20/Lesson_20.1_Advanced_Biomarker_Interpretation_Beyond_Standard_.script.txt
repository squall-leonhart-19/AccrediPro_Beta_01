Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you’re here with me today. In this lesson, we are going to dive into one of the most transformative skills you can develop as a functional practitioner: the ability to read blood chemistry through a functional lens. This is where the rubber meets the road. This is where you stop being just another person giving health advice and start being the practitioner who finally gives your clients the answers they’ve been searching for.

In our previous module, we spent a lot of time looking at research and evidence. We talked about how to vet literature and understand the science of functional medicine. But now, we’re transitioning. We’re moving from the world of general literature to the world of the individual. This lesson is your formal entry into high-level clinical assessment. My goal today is to teach you how to see the "subclinical" stories that are hidden in plain sight on every standard lab report.

Welcome to the team. I know from experience that one of the most heartbreaking things a client can go through is feeling absolutely terrible—suffering from fatigue, brain fog, or digestive issues—only to be told by their primary care doctor that their labs are "perfectly normal." When a client hears that, they don't feel relieved. They feel gaslit. They feel like it’s all in their head. In this lesson, I’m going to teach you how to bridge that gap between "not sick" and "thriving." We aren't looking for pathology today. We are looking for the loss of function. We’re going to explore how to identify pre-pathological trends using the standard blood work your clients already have sitting in their kitchen drawers. This is how you provide the legitimacy and the root-cause resolution that changes lives.

By the time we finish today, you’ll be able to do five specific things. First, you’ll distinguish between those wide pathological reference ranges and the narrow, functional "optimal" ranges we use for prevention. Second, you’ll learn to analyze CBC patterns to find hidden infections or nutrient needs before they ever turn into anemia. Third, we’ll look at the CMP to assess how well the liver is detoxifying and how the kidneys are holding up. Fourth, I’ll show you how to use LDH, Uric Acid, and Ferritin as a trio to spot systemic inflammation. And finally, I’m going to teach you a simple calculation called the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, or NLR, which is one of the best predictors of subclinical inflammation we have.

Before we get into the numbers, I want to tell you a story about a client named Sarah. She was a 48-year-old former teacher, and she came to me completely exhausted. She had classic symptoms: brain fog that made it hard to focus, afternoon energy crashes where she felt like she needed a nap at 3:00 PM just to survive, her hair was thinning, and she was gaining weight even though she hadn't changed her diet. 

She had just seen her doctor, and she was told everything was "perfect." Her TSH, which measures thyroid function, was 3.8. The lab range goes up to 4.5, so her doctor said she was fine. Her fasting glucose was 98. The lab range says anything under 100 is normal, so again, she was told she was fine. 

But when we applied our functional lens, the story changed. In functional medicine, we want that TSH to be under 2.0. At 3.8, Sarah’s thyroid was already struggling. It was a "subclinical" hypothyroid state. And that glucose of 98? That’s on the absolute precipice of insulin resistance. In a truly healthy person, we want that between 75 and 86. By identifying these trends early, we were able to use targeted nutrition and lifestyle changes to reverse her symptoms in just 90 days. She didn't need a diagnosis; she needed a course correction. That is the power of what I’m teaching you today.

Let’s start with the foundation: Pathological versus Functional ranges. You have to understand that standard laboratory reference ranges are based on a bell curve. Think about who goes to get blood work done at a standard lab. It’s usually people who are already feeling sick. In the United States, that population is increasingly sedentary, over-stressed, and metabolically compromised. So, when a lab says you are in the "normal" range, they are essentially saying, "You are just as sick as the average person in this zip code." 

In functional medicine, we don't want you to be average. We want you to be optimal. We use functional ranges, which are much narrower. These are based on healthy, asymptomatic populations where physiological function is at its peak. 

Think about fasting glucose. The standard range is often 65 to 99 mg/dL. But if your client is sitting at 98, they are already experiencing glycation and early insulin resistance. We want them in that sweet spot of 75 to 86. Or look at Hemoglobin A1c. The lab might say anything up to 5.6% is normal, but we know that once you cross 5.2%, the risk for cardiovascular events starts to climb. 

Ferritin is another great example, especially for women. The lab range is huge—15 to 150. But if a woman has a ferritin of 20, she’s going to lose her hair and feel exhausted because she doesn't have enough iron storage for her thyroid to work properly. On the flip side, if it’s over 100 and she’s not taking an iron supplement, that’s a red flag for inflammation. 

And then there’s the TSH we mentioned with Sarah. The standard range is roughly 0.4 to 4.5. But for most people, once that number climbs above 2.0, they start feeling the metabolic slowing and the HPA axis dysregulation. 

When a client tells you, "My doctor said my labs are fine," I want you to have this response ready. You can say: "Standard ranges are designed to find disease that already exists. Functional ranges are designed to find the health that is missing. We want to catch the smoke before there’s a fire." This isn't just about being right; it’s about positioning. When you can provide this level of insight, it justifies your premium fees. Clients are happy to pay for a lab review when you’re giving them a roadmap they can’t get anywhere else.

Now, let’s talk about the CBC, or the Complete Blood Count. This is probably the most ordered lab in the world. Most doctors glance at it to make sure the client doesn't have leukemia or severe anemia, and then they move on. But for us, the CBC is a gold mine. It’s a snapshot of the immune system and nutrient status.

One of the first things I look at is the MCV, which stands for Mean Corpuscular Volume. This tells us the average size of the red blood cells. The standard range is usually 80 to 100, but we look for a tighter window of 82 to 92. Why does the size matter? Well, if the cells are getting too big—let’s say the MCV is 94 or 95—it’s a huge clue that the body is struggling with B12 or folate. The cells are getting "puffy" because they can't divide properly. Even if the client isn't officially "anemic" yet, they are likely suffering from the fatigue that comes with B-vitamin insufficiency. On the other hand, if that MCV is below 82, it tells us the cells are too small. This is usually a sign of iron deficiency or perhaps some chronic blood loss, even if the hemoglobin still looks okay.

Then we look at the "Differential," which breaks down the types of white blood cells. I like to think of the "Diff" as a report on who is winning the internal war. In a healthy person, we want to see a nice balance. Neutrophils should be around 60% and Lymphocytes around 30%. That’s a 2-to-1 ratio. 

If you see Neutrophils climbing above 65%, your client might be dealing with an acute bacterial infection, or they might just be under an immense amount of physical stress. If Lymphocytes are high—say, over 35%—you need to start thinking about chronic viral loads. This is where things like Epstein-Barr or CMV come into play. It could also be a sign of chronic toxicity. 

And don't ignore the Eosinophils. If they are over 3%, that’s almost always a sign that the immune system is reacting to something. It could be food sensitivities, it could be environmental allergies, or it could even be parasites. It’s a signal to dig deeper into the gut and the environment.

Next, let’s move to the CMP, the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel. This gives us a look at the liver, the kidneys, and the electrolytes. In our methodology, we use the CMP to assess what we call "biotransformation capacity"—basically, how well is the body cleaning itself out?

I want to point out a very important study from 2022 published in The Lancet. It showed that when liver enzymes like AST and ALT are in the high-30s, even though that’s "normal" by lab standards, there is actually a 25% increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. That is a massive finding. In functional medicine, we want to see those enzymes below 25. If they are creeping up into the 30s, the liver is under stress. It’s struggling to keep up with the toxic load or the metabolic demand.

We also look at Albumin. The optimal range is 4.5 to 5.0. If you see it on the low end of normal, it’s a big red flag. It could mean the client isn't eating enough protein, or they aren't absorbing it. But Albumin is also what we call a "negative acute-phase reactant," which is just a fancy way of saying that when inflammation goes up, Albumin goes down. 

Then there’s BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen. We like to see this between 10 and 16. If it’s high-normal, say 18 or 20, it’s often just dehydration. But it can also be a sign that the client has low stomach acid. If you don't have enough acid to break down protein, you end up with more urea in the blood. 

And don’t forget Alkaline Phosphatase, or ALP. The optimal range is 70 to 90. If you see a client with an ALP below 55, you should immediately think about zinc or magnesium deficiency. Zinc is a co-factor for this enzyme, so if zinc is low, the enzyme level drops. It’s a beautiful, indirect way to spot a nutrient deficiency without needing a separate, expensive test.

Now, let’s talk about inflammation. We call this the "Inflammation Trio": LDH, Uric Acid, and Ferritin. When you’re assessing systemic inflammation, you can't just look at one marker. You have to look for patterns. If these three are all elevated—even within their "normal" ranges—you can be almost certain that oxidative stress is high.

First is LDH, or Lactate Dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in almost every tissue in your body. When cells get damaged, they spill LDH into the blood. The functional range is 140 to 180. If I see a client with an LDH over 190, I’m concerned. Even if the lab says 250 is fine, that 190 tells me there is cellular turnover happening. It could be from intense exercise, sure, but it could also be mold exposure or hidden tissue breakdown.

Then we have Uric Acid. Most people only think about Uric Acid when they think of gout, but it’s actually a very sensitive marker for fructose metabolism and oxidative stress. We want to see it between 3.5 and 5.0. There was a huge meta-analysis in 2023 with over 12,000 participants that showed that for women, once Uric Acid goes above 5.5, the risk for metabolic syndrome and hypertension shoots up. If your client’s Uric Acid is high, you need to look at their sugar intake and their metabolic health immediately.

And the third part of the trio is Ferritin. As I mentioned earlier, Ferritin stores iron, but it’s also an "acute-phase reactant." This means the body cranks up Ferritin production when it’s under inflammatory stress. We want it between 50 and 100. If you have a female client who isn't taking iron supplements and her Ferritin is 160, it’s almost never about having too much iron. It’s almost always about too much inflammation. The body is "locking away" the iron so that potential pathogens can't use it to grow. It’s a defense mechanism, but it’s a sign that the internal environment is on fire.

This brings us to one of my favorite tools: the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, or NLR. This is something you won't find on a standard lab report, but you can calculate it in about five seconds using the CBC. You just take the Absolute Neutrophil count and divide it by the Absolute Lymphocyte count. 

This ratio is one of the most cost-effective ways to predict subclinical systemic inflammation. In a perfect world, we want that ratio between 1.0 and 2.0. That represents homeostasis. If the ratio climbs between 2.1 and 3.0, we’re looking at mild systemic inflammation or chronic stress. But once it crosses 3.0, we are looking at significant inflammation and a high risk for cardiovascular and metabolic complications. 

There was a study in the Journal of Clinical Medicine in 2021 that followed 8,000 people for ten years. They found that an NLR greater than 2.5 was associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality. Think about that. A simple calculation from a basic blood test can tell you that much about a person’s long-term health risk. That is the kind of data that builds immense trust with your clients.

So, how do we put this all together? As a functional practitioner, you are a "Health Detective." You never look at one lab in isolation. You look for patterns of dysfunction. 

Let’s look at a pattern we call "Inflammaging." Imagine a client comes in and their glucose is 95—high-normal. Their NLR is 2.8—high-optimal. Their Uric Acid is 5.8—high-normal. And their Ferritin is 165—also high-normal. Individually, a conventional doctor would look at those and say the client is "fine." They might even say, "Great job, see you next year." 

But you? You see a story. You see a story of metabolic inflammation. You see a client who is on a direct path toward Type 2 Diabetes or heart disease. Because you caught this now, you can use our methodology to target the root cause and sustain their health before a diagnosis ever happens. You are literally changing their future.

Let’s do a quick check of what we’ve covered. I want you to think about these four questions. 

First, why is a TSH of 3.5 considered suboptimal in our world even if the lab says it’s normal? Remember, we want the thyroid to be efficient, and once it crosses 2.0, we usually see the metabolism start to slow down. 

Second, if a client’s Alkaline Phosphatase is 42, what should you look for? That’s right—zinc and magnesium. Low ALP is a classic sign of those deficiencies. 

Third, if a client has an Absolute Neutrophil count of 6.0 and a Lymphocyte count of 1.5, what’s their NLR? It’s 4.0. That is a very high ratio and suggests significant systemic inflammation that needs immediate attention. 

And fourth, what does a high-normal Ferritin over 150 usually mean in a woman who isn't supplementing? It’s an inflammatory signal, not an iron signal.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to keep in your back pocket. 

Remember that standard ranges are about identifying disease, while functional ranges are about identifying optimal performance. Never interpret a single marker alone; always look for those clusters, like the Inflammation Trio. Use the CBC as your immune map to distinguish between bacterial, viral, or allergic trends. Treat the NLR as a vital sign—it’s a powerful, free tool to quantify how much stress the body is under. And finally, remember that using this data provides the "reveal" that builds incredible trust. When you can show a client exactly why they feel the way they do, even when everyone else told them they were fine, you have won a client for life.

You are doing amazing work. Learning to read the body’s language like this takes time and practice, but it is the most rewarding skill you can have. Keep digging into the patterns, keep asking "why," and keep looking for the health that is missing. 

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
