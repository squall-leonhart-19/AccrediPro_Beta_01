Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you are joining me for this lesson. We have already done some incredible work together. In our last session, we really mastered the gut-brain axis. We looked at how to use comprehensive stool analysis to understand how a client is absorbing nutrients and how their microbiome is influencing their mood and their cognition. But today, we are going to bridge a very important gap. We are moving from the world of assimilation and moving into the world of communication.

I want you to think about hormones as the primary language of the body. They are the chemical messengers that tell our cells what to do, when to grow, how to burn energy, and how to respond to the environment. But here is the thing that many practitioners miss: hormones do not exist in a vacuum. Their production, their transport through the blood, and their eventual clearance through the liver and the gut are the ultimate indicators of how efficient a person’s metabolism really is.

In this lesson, we are going to dive deep into hormonal mapping. For many of your clients, especially women in that forty to fifty-five age bracket, hormonal issues are often presented to them by other providers as a simple deficiency or an excess of a single molecule. They are told they just have low progesterone or high estrogen. But in functional medicine, we know better than to stop there. We don't just look at the levels of the hormones themselves. We look at the pathways. We look at the journey that hormone takes from the moment it is created to the moment it leaves the body. Today, I am going to teach you how to use the DUTCH test, which is the dried urine test for comprehensive hormones, along with salivary analysis to map exactly where the communication breakdown is occurring in your clients.

Our goals for today are very specific. First, we are going to evaluate HPA-axis dysfunction. We aren't just looking at total cortisol; we are looking at the Cortisol Awakening Response, or the CAR, and the diurnal patterns throughout the day. Next, we will interpret the three main estrogen metabolic pathways—the two, the four, and the sixteen hydroxy pathways—so you can actually assess clinical risk for your clients. We will also analyze androgen activity, specifically looking at five-alpha and five-beta reductase, which is going to help you personalize protocols for things like PCOS and hair loss. Then, we will look at how the liver handles these hormones through methylation. Finally, I’ll help you develop targeted nutraceutical strategies based on this objective data.

Let’s start with the HPA-axis. When we talk about stress, most people think of cortisol. And while a blood test for cortisol gives us a snapshot in time, it doesn't tell the whole story. It is like looking at a single frame of a movie and trying to guess the entire plot. Salivary and urinary mapping, on the other hand, provide a cinematographic view of the stress response. The most critical biomarker we have in modern functional endocrinology is the Cortisol Awakening Response.

Think of the CAR as a mini stress test that the brain performs the second you wake up. Within thirty minutes of your eyes opening, your cortisol should rise by about fifty to one hundred and sixty percent. This rise represents your HPA-axis resiliency. It is your body’s way of preparing you for the demands of the day. If that rise is healthy, it shows that your brain and your adrenal glands are communicating well. But if you see a flat CAR, that is a major red flag. A flat response often correlates with burnout, chronic fatigue, or even PTSD. What is fascinating is that a client can have a normal total daily cortisol level but still have a flat CAR. This means they might have enough cortisol to get through the day, but their brain’s ability to regulate the rhythm is failing.

Here is a practitioner pearl for you to remember: if you see a client with high total cortisol but a low or flat CAR, they are essentially running on fumes. Their body is overproducing cortisol just to keep up with the demands of their life, but the nervous system is losing its ability to lead the dance. In these cases, you have to target the brain and the nervous system before you ever try to target the adrenal glands directly. We have to calm the storm in the mind to fix the rhythm in the body.

Now, let’s move into the estrogen map. In the ROOTS Method, we try to move away from the vague term estrogen dominance. Instead, we focus on estrogen metabolism. Once the liver processes estrogens like E1 and E2, they head down three distinct Phase One pathways. I like to think of these as the green, red, and yellow roads.

The two-OH pathway is the green road. This is the protective pathway. It has weak estrogenic activity and is associated with a much lower risk of DNA damage. This is where we want most of our client's estrogen to go. Then there is the four-OH pathway, which is the red road. This one is risky. This pathway can lead to the formation of quinones, which can directly damage DNA. If you see high levels on the red road, it indicates a higher risk for estrogen-sensitive issues. Finally, there is the sixteen-OH pathway, the yellow road. This pathway is highly proliferative. It is associated with those symptoms we often see in practice like heavy periods, fibroids, and breast tenderness.

Our goal as practitioners is not just to lower estrogen across the board. That can lead to its own set of problems like bone loss or mood issues. Instead, we want to shunt the estrogen toward that protective two-OH green road. We can do this using very specific tools like DIM or sulforaphane, which help the liver choose the right path.

While we are talking about pathways, we have to talk about androgens. For your female clients who are struggling with adult acne, thinning hair on their scalp, or the symptoms of PCOS, the total testosterone number on a blood test rarely tells the whole story. You have to look at something called five-alpha reductase activity.

Testosterone can be metabolized in two ways: the five-alpha pathway or the five-beta pathway. The five-alpha pathway creates something called Dihydrotestosterone, or DHT. Now, DHT is three to five times more potent than regular testosterone. If a client’s body prefers the five-alpha pathway, they are going to experience androgenic symptoms like oily skin or hair loss, even if their testosterone levels are technically in the normal range on a standard lab test.

This is another practitioner pearl for you. When you see a preference for that alpha pathway on a DUTCH test, you can use things like saw palmetto or reishi mushroom. These act as natural inhibitors for that five-alpha enzyme. It is a much more elegant solution than just trying to suppress testosterone entirely. You are simply changing how the body uses what it already has.

But even after we have shunted estrogen down the right path and managed our androgens, we have to make sure the body can actually get rid of these hormones. This brings us to the methylation gatekeeper. Once estrogen is processed in Phase One, it has to be methylated in Phase Two so it can be safely excreted. This is where the COMT enzyme comes into play.

On a hormonal map, we look at the ratio between two-OH estrogen and two-methoxyestrogen. If a client has plenty of two-OH but very little two-methoxy, it means their methylation gate is closed. The hormones are getting to the gate, but they can't get through. This causes a backup in the system, leading to an accumulation of toxic intermediates. This is why we must organize our data carefully. We have to ask: is the problem the hormone itself, or is the problem the biotransformation and clearance of that hormone? Often, it is the latter.

To help you see how this looks in the real world, let’s talk about a client named Sarah. She was a forty-eight-year-old nurse practitioner who was transitioning into her own private practice. She came to me because she was waking up absolutely exhausted. She needed three coffees just to start her day. By the time evening rolled around, she felt wired but tired. She couldn't shut her brain off. On top of that, she was noticing her hair was thinning and her periods were becoming incredibly heavy and painful.

When we ran her hormonal map, the data was so clear. Her Cortisol Awakening Response was almost completely flat. She only had a point-two rise in the morning. No wonder she needed all that caffeine. Her estrogen markers showed she was sending almost everything down the four-OH and sixteen-OH pathways, and her methylation index was very low. She also had a very strong preference for that five-alpha androgen pathway, which explained the thinning hair.

Now, if we had just looked at her symptoms, we might have just given her some generic hormone cream. But because we had the map, we targeted the root causes. We used phosphatidylserine in the evening to help calm that wired but tired feeling. We introduced methylated B-vitamins to open up that Phase Two detox gate. And we used sulforaphane to shunt her estrogen away from the risky pathways and toward the protective ones.

Within ninety days, Sarah told me she had levels of energy she hadn't felt since her thirties. Her hair started to fill back in, and her cycles became manageable again. And because she understood the power of this mapping process, she was able to confidently start charging four hundred and fifty dollars for her own hormonal consultations. She wasn't just guessing anymore; she was practicing precision medicine.

As you reach the target phase of our method, your data should dictate your protocol. I want to encourage you to avoid those broad-spectrum hormone balancers you see on the shelves. They are often too blunt of an instrument. Instead, use precision tools.

If you see a low CAR, you might consider things like adrenal cortex or licorice root, provided their blood pressure is stable. You can even suggest something as simple as morning blue-light exposure to help reset that circadian rhythm. For high four-OH estrogen, you want to reach for sulforaphane, DIM, or even calcium-d-glucarate. The glucarate is especially important because it prevents something called enterohepatic recirculation, which is basically when the gut un-packages the estrogen you just detoxified and sends it back into the bloodstream.

If the methylation index is poor, think about magnesium, SAMe, and active B-vitamins like folate and B12. And for that five-alpha preference we talked about, zinc and EGCG from green tea can be incredibly helpful alongside saw palmetto.

One final practitioner pearl before we wrap up: always, always check the gut before you start a heavy hormone protocol. Do you remember from our last lesson when we talked about beta-glucuronidase? If a client has high levels of that enzyme in their gut, it acts like a pair of scissors. It will unzip the estrogen that the liver worked so hard to detoxify. The client will then reabsorb that estrogen, and it will negate all the hard work you are doing with your supplements. You have to clear the path in the gut so the hormones have a way out of the building.

Let’s take a moment to check your understanding of what we have covered. Imagine you have a client with a flat CAR but high total daily cortisol. What should your primary focus be? Remember, that flat CAR tells us the brain-to-gland communication is broken. You need to focus on the nervous system and the brain’s rhythm, not just the adrenal glands.

Think about which estrogen metabolite is the most risky. That would be the four-OH pathway, because of its ability to form those DNA-damaging quinones. And if a client has acne or hair loss but their testosterone is normal, what are you looking for? You are looking for that five-alpha reductase preference, which creates the more potent DHT. Finally, why is that methylation index so important? Because it tells us if the liver can actually finish the job of neutralizing estrogen so it can be safely removed from the body.

As we finish up today, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, remember that hormonal health is about pathways and clearance, not just the absolute levels of production. Second, the Cortisol Awakening Response is your gold-standard biomarker for assessing how resilient a client’s stress response really is. Third, you have the power to shunt estrogen metabolism toward protective routes using targeted nutrition. Fourth, androgenic symptoms are often driven by enzyme preference, not just high testosterone. And finally, you must integrate gut health and liver health to ensure those hormones are cleared safely.

You are doing amazing work. By mastering these pathways, you are moving beyond being a coach who just recommends vitamins. You are becoming a practitioner who can read the body’s internal map and provide a clear, objective path to healing.

Great work today. I am so proud of the progress you are making. I will see you in the next lesson where we will continue to build on these foundations. Keep going, the world needs your expertise.
