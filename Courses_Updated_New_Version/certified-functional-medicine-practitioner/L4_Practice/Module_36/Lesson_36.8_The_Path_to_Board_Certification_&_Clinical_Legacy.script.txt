Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell here. I am so glad you are joining me for this final Practice Lab. We have spent so much time together diving deep into the science. We have looked at the gut-brain axis. We have mastered hormone pathways. We have looked at complex lab markers. But today, we are doing something different. We are pivoting from clinical excellence to professional sustainability. This is the part of the certification where we make sure you can actually take all that incredible knowledge and turn it into a thriving, sustainable practice. Because here is the hard truth. You can be the most brilliant functional practitioner in the world. You can understand the Krebs cycle better than anyone. But if you cannot lead a client through a decision to work with you, you cannot help them. You cannot change their life if they never say yes to the protocol.

I want to start by being very honest with you. I remember exactly how it felt when I first started charging for my services. I was a nurse for fifteen years. In the clinical world, someone else handles the billing. You just show up and provide care. So, when I transitioned into functional medicine and had to start talking about money, it felt incredibly uncomfortable. I struggled with massive imposter syndrome. I would find myself wanting to give everything away for free. I felt like a "salesperson" in the worst sense of the word. But then I realized something that changed everything for me. Your expertise is a premium service. It is a specialized skill set that solves problems most conventional doctors cannot touch. When you charge what you are worth, you are not just taking money. You are creating a container for a client to finally get the results they have been searching for years to find. Today, I am going to walk you through the exact discovery call structure that helped me go from zero dollars to a consistent ten-thousand-dollar-a-month practice while working from my home office.

In this lesson, we have five very specific goals. First, I want you to master the four-phase structure of a high-converting discovery call. This is the blueprint. Second, we are going to develop a confident response to that dreaded "I need to think about it" objection. Third, you are going to learn how to present your program pricing as an investment in an outcome, not just a cost for your time. Fourth, we will look at some realistic income scenarios so you can see the path to your own financial freedom. And finally, we are going to practice the "Close" using language that feels high-authority but low-pressure.

Let’s start with the psychology of the discovery call. This is the most important mindset shift you will ever make. A discovery call is not a sales pitch. It is a diagnostic interview for the relationship. Your only goal in these thirty minutes is to determine two things. One, is this person a good fit for your specific methodology? And two, are you the right person to help them achieve their specific goals? Research shows that practitioners who follow a structured enrollment process have a forty-two percent higher conversion rate than those who just "wing it." When you wing it, you sound unsure. When you follow a structure, you sound like the expert they have been looking for.

I want you to stop trying to "sell" and start trying to "serve." If you truly believe that your functional approach can help someone who has been suffering for years, then it is actually your professional duty to lead them toward a decision. If you let them walk away because you were too afraid to talk about money, you are leaving them in their illness. That is not service.

To make this real, let’s look at a prospect profile. We will call her Diane. Diane is forty-nine years old. She is a high-school administrator and a mother of two. She has been struggling with what she calls "mystery symptoms" for three years. She is exhausted. She has brain fog. Her joints ache. She has seen her primary care doctor four times, and every time, they tell her that her labs are "normal." But Diane knows she isn't normal. She feels like a shell of herself. She is the "Ideal Client Avatar" for a functional practice. She is motivated, she is frustrated with the standard of care, and she is looking for a root-cause solution.

Now, how do we talk to Diane? We use a thirty-minute discovery script. This script is designed to maintain your authority while building deep rapport. It has four distinct phases.

Phase one is the Frame. This happens in the first two minutes. You have to take the lead immediately. Imagine you are talking to Diane. You say, "Hi Diane! I’ve been looking forward to our chat. Before we start, I want to make sure we make the most of our thirty minutes together. My goal today is to understand exactly what’s going on with your health, share how my functional approach works, and if we’re a fit, I’ll show you what working together looks like. Does that sound good?"

By saying this, you have established that you are the professional. You have set a time limit. You have told her exactly what to expect. This lowers her anxiety and puts you in the driver's seat.

Phase two is the Deep Dive. This is where most practitioners make a mistake. They start talking about themselves too soon. I want you to do the opposite. I want you to ask one powerful question and then listen. You ask, "Tell me, Diane... if we were sitting here a year from now and you were celebrating your health, what would have changed for you? What does 'feeling like yourself' actually look like in your daily life?"

Now, here is a pro-tip. Use what I call "The Golden Silence." After Diane finishes speaking, wait three seconds. Just three seconds of silence. It will feel like an eternity, but don't break it. Often, after that pause, the client will share the real emotional reason they are there. They might say, "I just want to be able to play with my grandkids without needing a nap," or "I’m afraid I’m going to lose my job because I can’t focus." That is the "Why." That is what they are actually buying.

Then, you follow up with a "Why Now" question. You ask, "And why is fixing this a priority right now? What happens if you stay on the current path for another six months?" This helps Diane realize that the cost of doing nothing is much higher than the cost of your program.

Phase three is the Bridge. This is where you connect her problems to your solution. You say, "Based on what you've shared, Diane—the fatigue, the brain fog, and the frustration with 'normal' labs—I can see exactly where the gaps are. In my twelve-week Root Cause Restoration program, we don't just guess. We use functional testing to look at your adrenals and your gut health, and then we build a protocol tailored to your unique biology. This isn't a quick fix; it's a total recalibration."

Notice I didn't say "I will give you a meal plan and some vitamins." I used the words "Root Cause," "Functional Testing," and "Unique Biology." This positions you as a specialist, not a generalist.

Finally, phase four is the Invitation. This is the part that makes people nervous, but it shouldn't. You are simply inviting her to the next step. You say, "Diane, I’m confident I can help you get your energy back. I’d love to invite you to join the program. The investment for the twelve-week intensive is twenty-five hundred dollars. We can get your intake forms and your first lab kit sent out today. How does that sound?"

Then, you stop talking. You wait for her response.

Now, let's talk about what happens next. Often, you will get an objection. I want you to understand that objections are rarely about the money. They are almost always about certainty. The client is asking themselves, "Is this the thing that will finally work for me?"

If she says, "It’s too expensive," don't get defensive. Instead, lead with empathy. You can say, "I understand. It is a significant investment. But let's look at the cost of not doing this. How much have you already spent on supplements, co-pays, and random tests that didn't actually give you an answer?" You are shifting the focus from the price to the value of the solution.

If she says, "I need to talk to my husband," you respond with support. "I completely support that, Diane. It’s important to be on the same page. When you talk to him, what do you think he'll be most concerned about? Will it be the cost, the time commitment, or whether this will actually work for you?" This helps her identify her own lingering doubts so you can address them together.

And if she says, "I’m too busy right now," you remind her of the stakes. "I hear you. Life is incredibly full. But will life be less busy in three months? If we start now, we can get your energy back so that you actually have the capacity to handle your busy life much better."

Here is a very important coach tip: Never lower your price on the call. If you lower your price the moment they push back, you are telling them that your expertise isn't actually worth what you said it was. If they have a genuine budget constraint, you can offer a payment plan—maybe three payments of eight hundred and seventy-five dollars—but keep the total value of your expertise intact.

Let’s talk about pricing with confidence. As a Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner, you are providing a high-level professional service. You are not a health coach who just finished a weekend seminar. You have deep clinical knowledge. A 2023 industry survey of over twelve hundred functional practitioners found that the average three-month program price ranges from eighteen hundred to forty-five hundred dollars. And that usually excludes the cost of the lab tests.

Think about Linda. Linda was a former teacher who transitioned into a functional practice. When she started, she was stuck in the "hourly trap." She charged one hundred and fifty dollars per hour. She was exhausted, she was constantly chasing new clients, and she felt completely burnt out. She was working harder than she did as a teacher but making less. Then, she switched to a program model. She created a twenty-two-hundred-dollar comprehensive program. Suddenly, she only needed five clients a month to exceed her old teaching salary. Within eighteen months, Linda had a waitlist. She was generating twelve thousand dollars a month while only working twenty-five hours a week. She had time for her own health, her family, and her continuing education. That is the power of the program model.

When you charge for a program, you are charging for the outcome. You are charging for the transformation. You are not charging for sixty minutes of your time. When a client pays for a program, they are more committed. They follow the protocol. They get better results. And better results lead to more referrals.

Now, I want to look at some income projections. I want you to see what is possible for you as you launch your practice. These numbers are based on a very standard twelve-week program priced at twenty-five hundred dollars.

Let's look at the "Side Hustle" scenario. If you enroll just two clients a month, that is five thousand dollars in monthly revenue. That is sixty thousand dollars a year. For many people, this is the perfect way to transition out of a nine-to-five job while building a solid foundation.

Next is the "Full-Time Pro." If you enroll four clients a month—that is just one person a week—you are generating ten thousand dollars a month. That is a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year. This is a thriving, sustainable solo practice where you can give each client incredible attention without burning yourself out.

And then there is the "Authority" level. If you are enrolling eight clients a month, you are looking at twenty thousand dollars a month, or two hundred and forty thousand dollars a year. At this level, you would likely hire a part-time assistant to help with admin so you can stay focused on the clinical work.

My advice for you right now is to focus on your first three "Foundational Clients." When you are just starting, it is okay to offer a "Beta" rate. Maybe you charge fifteen hundred dollars for those first three people in exchange for a very detailed testimonial. This builds the social proof you need. Once you have those three success stories, you will have the confidence to charge your full twenty-five hundred dollar rate and beyond.

Before we wrap up, let’s do a quick check of your understanding. I want you to think about these four questions.

First, what is the primary goal of Phase Two, the Deep Dive, in the discovery call? Think about it for a second. The answer is to understand the client’s emotional "Why" and the cost of them staying on their current path. It is about building the gap between where they are and where they want to be.

Second, if a client says, "I've tried everything and nothing works," how should you respond? You should acknowledge their frustration and then pivot to how your approach is different. You might say, "I hear you, and it’s exhausting to feel like you’ve tried everything. But most of what you’ve tried has likely been addressing symptoms. We are going to look at the underlying function of your systems using data we haven't seen yet."

Third, why is a "Program Model" better than an "Hourly Model" for your practice? The answer is twofold. It provides better clinical outcomes because the client is committed to a full process, and it provides financial stability for you because you aren't trading time for dollars.

And fourth, how should you handle the "Talk to my spouse" objection? Remember, you support the conversation, but you ask what the spouse's specific concern will be. This keeps the momentum going and helps the client prepare for that conversation.

As we conclude this lesson, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways.

First, structure equals sales. Following a four-phase script increases your conversion rate by over forty percent. It isn't about being a "salesperson"; it is about being a professional leader.

Second, always listen for the "Why." The emotional reason a client wants to change is always more powerful than the clinical reason. They aren't buying a thyroid protocol; they are buying the ability to feel vibrant again.

Third, price for outcomes. Charge based on the transformation you provide, not the hours you spend. You are a specialist, and your pricing should reflect that.

Fourth, view objections as questions. An objection is almost always a request for more certainty. It isn't a rejection of you; it is a fear of the unknown. Your job is to provide that certainty.

And finally, scalability is real. You do not need hundreds of clients to have a six-figure income. Enrolling just one client per week at twenty-five hundred dollars creates a highly successful practice.

You have the clinical knowledge. You have the heart for service. And now, you have the structure to build a business that supports your life while you change the lives of others. I am so proud of the work you have put in during this certification. Go out there, lead those discovery calls with confidence, and start building the practice of your dreams.

Great work today. I will see you in the next lesson.
