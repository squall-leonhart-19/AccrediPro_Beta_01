Hi, it is Sarah. It is so good to have you back with me for this next step in your journey. In our last lesson, we took a high-level look at the evolution of Shared Medical Appointments and why they are the future of functional medicine. But today, we are going to get into the heart of the matter. We are moving from the why to the how. I want to show you exactly how to translate our clinical R.O.O.T.S. Method into a scalable, high-impact group curriculum.

One of the biggest hurdles I see practitioners face when they think about moving away from one-on-one care is a very real fear. It is the fear of diluting your impact. You have spent years honing your clinical brain. You know how to look at a patient, listen to their story, and connect the dots in a way that feels like magic. There is a worry that if you move into a group setting, that magic will disappear. You might feel like you are just becoming a teacher rather than a healer. But I want to challenge that today. In fact, I want to show you that group learning actually enhances the R.O.O.T.S. Method. By leveraging what we call social contagion and shared discovery, you can actually see better clinical outcomes in a group than you ever did in isolation. We are not just teaching a class here. We are mapping a clinical journey onto a classroom experience.

Think about your current practice. You probably spend a huge amount of time repeating the same foundational concepts to every single client. You explain what a leaky gut is. You explain why cortisol matters. You explain how to read a nutrition label. Now, imagine if you could take all that repetitive work and turn it into a powerful, synchronized experience for twenty people at once. That is what we are building today. We are going to walk through the five phases of the R.O.O.T.S. curriculum: the Reveal workshop, the Organize module, the Optimize intensive, the Target cohorts, and finally, the Sustain phase.

Let us start with the Reveal workshop. This is where the journey begins. In the Reveal phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method, our primary goal is to gather data. We are looking at the biomarkers, the history, and the current state of the client. In a traditional one-on-one model, this is the most time-consuming part of your week. You might spend sixty minutes with one person just explaining their lab results. If you have twenty clients, that is twenty hours of your life spent saying the exact same thing over and over again.

The Reveal workshop turns this on its head. It is designed to turn data collection and interpretation into an educational event. Instead of spending those twenty hours individually, you spend ninety minutes explaining trends to the whole group. Now, I know what you are thinking. What about privacy? What about HIPAA? Here is how we handle that. Participants receive their individual lab results privately through their own portal. They have them right there in front of them. But during the workshop, you are not looking at their specific numbers. You are teaching them how to interpret the trends that apply to everyone.

I always tell my coaches to follow one golden rule: always teach the physiological trend before you allow clients to look at their specific numbers. For example, you might spend fifteen minutes explaining why fasting insulin is such a critical marker for metabolic health. You talk about what it means when it is high, how it affects energy, and why the standard reference ranges are often misleading. You give them the context. You give them the why. Only after they understand the trend do you say, now, look at your own portal and see where your number sits on this scale.

This approach does two things. First, it prevents what I call lab anxiety. When a client opens a lab report and sees a red number without context, they panic. They think they are dying. But if you have already explained the physiology, they don't see a red number; they see a data point that they now have the power to change. Second, it keeps the group focused on the education rather than just their individual problems. A 2022 study on Shared Medical Appointments looked at over twelve hundred patients and found something fascinating. Patients who learned to interpret their own biomarkers had a twenty-two percent higher rate of adherence to lifestyle changes compared to those whose results were simply told to them by a doctor. When people understand the why, they do the work.

Once we have revealed the data, we move into the Organize module. This is where we take all those symptoms and lab markers and put them into a framework that makes sense. In functional medicine, we use the Matrix. It is our clinical map. In a group curriculum, your job is to teach the client how to become their own clinical detective. You aren't just organizing their symptoms for them; you are teaching them how to do it themselves.

I love to do this as a live classroom exercise. We provide everyone with a blank Functional Medicine Matrix. Then, we walk through each node together. We might start with the Assimilation node. I will explain that this is how your body takes in the world. It is about digestion, absorption, and the health of your gut. I will ask the group to look at their own lives. Do you have bloating? Do you have reflux? Do you have food triggers? I tell them to list those things in that specific box on their paper.

Then we move to Defense and Repair. This is the immune system. We talk about allergies, frequent colds, or even diagnosed autoimmunity. We move through Biotransformation, which is how the body clears waste. We talk about skin issues or chemical sensitivities. As we go through this, something amazing happens in the room or on the Zoom call. A client will look up and see five other people nodding their heads when I mention bloating. They see someone else writing down the same symptoms they have been ashamed of for years.

In that moment, their shame disappears. This is the social normalization effect of group learning. When a client realizes they aren't the only one struggling, they stop blaming themselves and start focusing on the solution. They realize that their symptoms aren't a character flaw; they are just data points in a node that needs support. As a coach, you can use that me-too moment to pivot directly into the clinical solution. You are building community and clinical clarity at the exact same time.

Now, after we have organized the map, we move into the Optimize intensive. This is where the heavy lifting of lifestyle change really happens. This is the heart of the program. The beauty of the Optimize phase is that lifestyle foundations—things like sleep, stress management, movement, and nutrition—are largely universal. Every human being needs a regulated circadian rhythm. Every human being needs nutrient-dense food and a way to modulate stress. Because these needs are universal, they are perfectly suited for a group intensive format.

I like to structure the Optimize curriculum into three core pillars. The first is circadian biology. We don't just tell them to sleep better. We create group challenges. We might have a week where everyone posts a photo of themselves getting morning light exposure. We might have a challenge where everyone wears blue light blocking glasses after 8:00 PM. The peer pressure here is positive. When you see twenty other people committed to their light hygiene, you are much more likely to stick with it yourself.

The second pillar is nutritional density. Instead of giving a boring meal plan, we do shared recipe swaps. We ask people to post photos of their pantry clean-outs. We turn nutrition into a social activity rather than a restrictive chore. And the third pillar is stress modulation. We close every workshop with a group-guided breathwork session or a short meditation. There is something incredibly powerful about meditating with a group, even virtually. It creates a shared physiological state of calm that reinforces the lesson.

Research shows that this kind of social support is the single greatest predictor of long-term success. We see this clearly in the data. When people change their habits in a vacuum, they often revert to their old ways as soon as life gets stressful. But when they change their habits alongside a tribe, those new behaviors become part of their identity.

Now, as you get more experienced with your group programs, you can move into the fourth phase: Targeting cohorts. While the optimization phase is universal, targeting is specific. Once you have mastered your foundational group program, you can start to create specialized curricula for specific pathologies. This is where you can really command higher price points because you are offering specialized expertise.

For example, you might create an Autoimmune Track. This curriculum would focus heavily on the target phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method, looking at things like gut barrier integrity and molecular mimicry. Or you might launch a Cardiometabolic Track that focuses specifically on mitochondrial medicine and insulin sensitivity. Another very popular one is the Perimenopause Track, focusing on the HPA and HPT axes to bring endocrine harmony to women in their forties and fifties.

My advice here is simple: do not try to launch five different cohorts at once. You will burn out. Start by mastering your foundational Optimize program. Get that running like a well-oiled machine. Then, look at your client base. Who are you seeing the most? If most of your clients are women over forty struggling with hormones, then your first targeted cohort should be Hormone Harmony. Use the data from your own practice to decide where to niche down.

Finally, we reach the Sustain phase. This is the final stage of the R.O.O.T.S. Method, and in many ways, it is the most important for both your clients and your business. In a traditional one-on-one practice, we often see a recurring pattern. A client comes in, they feel terrible, you work with them for three months, they start to feel better, and then they drop off. They think they are healed, so they stop doing the work. Six months later, they relapse and have to start all over again.

In a group model, the Sustain phase is your membership or your alumni program. We know that social support is the key to preventing clinical relapse. Your Sustain curriculum should be focused on long-term resilience. This might include quarterly group lab reviews to keep an eye on those biomarkers. It could include advanced topics like hormesis—teaching the group about cold plunges, saunas, or intermittent fasting. You can even allow your Sustain members to act as buddies for the new people entering the Reveal phase.

From a business perspective, the Sustain phase is where you build your financial freedom. Imagine having a hundred alumni in a membership program paying ninety-seven dollars a month. That is nearly ten thousand dollars of recurring revenue every month, and all you have to do is host one monthly Q&A call and manage a private community. It provides a stable floor for your income with very low overhead, allowing you to focus on your clinical work without the constant pressure of finding new clients.

To show you how this looks in the real world, I want to tell you about a practitioner named Sarah. She was a forty-eight-year-old former high school teacher who transitioned into functional health coaching. When I first met her, she was exhausted. She was capped at fifteen individual clients, earning about thirty-five hundred dollars a month. She had a three-month waitlist, which sounds great, but she was physically and mentally drained from repeating the same information all day long.

She decided to take her one-on-one Metabolic Reset protocol and convert it into a six-week group curriculum using this R.O.O.T.S. framework. Her first cohort had eighteen participants at four hundred and ninety-seven dollars each. In just six weeks, she earned nearly nine thousand dollars. But the most incredible part wasn't the money. She was only working about four hours a week on that group.

Even more importantly, her clinical outcomes improved. When she looked at the data, her clients' average HbA1c drop was 0.4 percent higher in the group setting than her previous one-on-one averages. Why? Because of peer accountability. When her clients saw their peers sticking to the protocol, they didn't want to be the ones to fall behind. The group dynamic did the coaching for her.

So, as we wrap up today, I want you to reflect on a few things. First, think about the Reveal workshop. How much time could you save by teaching lab trends to a group rather than explaining them one by one? Think about the Organize phase. Can you see how a client mapping their own symptoms onto the Matrix might feel more empowered than if you just gave them a diagnosis?

Think about the Optimize phase. Which of those three pillars—circadian biology, nutrition, or stress—do you think your clients struggle with the most? How could a group challenge help them break through? And finally, think about the Sustain phase. What would it feel like for your business to have a steady stream of recurring revenue from a community of alumni who are all supporting each other?

The R.O.O.T.S. Method is more than just a clinical framework. It is a blueprint for a business that scales and a practice that truly heals. It allows you to move from being the only source of truth for your clients to being the facilitator of a powerful, life-changing community.

I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to hold onto. Remember that the R.O.O.T.S. Method is your curriculum blueprint. It gives you a structure that you can use over and over again. Reveal workshops save you time and reduce client anxiety. Peer accountability in the Optimize phase is a clinical tool, not just a social one. Targeted cohorts allow you to show off your expertise and increase your value. And Sustain memberships are the key to long-term health for your clients and long-term wealth for your practice.

You are doing incredible work. I know that making this shift can feel daunting, but you have the clinical skills and the heart to make it happen. You are building something that will change lives on a scale you never thought possible.

Great work today. I am so proud of the progress you are making. I will see you in the next lesson, where we will dive even deeper into the logistics of launching your first program. Until then, keep dreaming big and stay focused on the impact you are here to make. See you soon.
