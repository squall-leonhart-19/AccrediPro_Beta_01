Hi, it’s Sarah. In this final lesson of Module 34, we are going to take everything you’ve learned about group dynamics and curriculum design and turn it into a practical, thriving business framework. This is our Practice Lab. It’s the space where we simulate the transition from that intensive one-on-one clinical work to a scalable group model that actually grows your impact without burning you out.

I know how many practitioners feel right now. I’ve sat in your seat. You might be feeling a bit of hesitation about launching a group program. Maybe you’re worried that selling to a group is somehow harder than selling a one-on-one package. Or perhaps you’re concerned that the results won’t be as good. In reality, it is often the opposite. Selling a group is about demonstrating the power of community. It’s about showing people they no longer have to suffer in isolation. Today, we are going to practice the exact conversations that fill seats and, more importantly, change lives.

By the end of this session, you’ll have mastered the four-phase Group Enrollment Call structure. You will be able to confidently articulate the Community Advantage to even your most skeptical prospects. We’re going to tackle those common objections about privacy and personal attention. We’ll also do some very real math to calculate your income potential for small and mid-sized launches. Finally, I’ll help you practice the closing techniques specifically designed for cohort-based programs.

Let’s start with the Prospect Profile. Before you ever jump on a call, you have to know exactly who you are speaking to. When you’re doing one-on-one work, you’re often looking for a person with a specific set of symptoms. But for a group program, you’re looking for someone who fits the cohort dynamic. You’re looking for a person who will benefit from the group energy.

Let me tell you about Linda. Linda is 52 years old. She’s a high-level HR Director. She’s a busy professional, she’s right in the middle of perimenopause, and she is struggling every day with brain fog and weight gain. But here is the deeper story. Linda is tired of feeling invisible. She’s exhausted from trying to do it all on her own. She’s actually tried one-on-one coaching before. She had a great practitioner, but she felt isolated. When things got busy at work, she felt like she was the only one struggling, and she eventually quit. 

Her hesitation now is very specific. She’s wondering if she’ll have to share her private health details with a group of strangers. She’s also worried that a group program might be a watered-down version of what I do individually. Her goal, though, is clear. She wants a roadmap. She wants a support system that keeps her accountable, and she’d prefer not to pay the high price tag of VIP coaching if she doesn’t have to.

When you are talking to someone like Linda, your job is to sell the result and the support container. You aren’t just selling information. Linda doesn't need more tips or PDFs. She needs a container that ensures she actually follows through this time. This is where the Group Enrollment Script comes in. Unlike a one-on-one discovery call, this call focuses heavily on the shared experience. You want Linda to see herself in the other members of the group.

Phase one of this script is Validation. This is where you acknowledge her struggle and immediately connect it to the group. You might say, Linda, I hear you. The brain fog you’re describing is exactly why I created this specific cohort. You are not alone in feeling like your brain has gone offline. In fact, three of the women who already joined this morning said those exact same words. 

Now, here is my first coach tip for you. Always use the Bridge Technique. This means you should always connect a prospect’s specific pain point to a specific week in your curriculum. If Linda mentions her sleep is terrible, you tell her, That is exactly why in Week Three, we focus entirely on the circadian rhythm and cortisol reset. By doing this, you show her that the group isn't just a general health class; it is a direct solution to her specific problems.

Now let’s talk about handling group-specific objections. When you move to groups, the questions change. People stop asking, Can you help me? and they start asking, Can a group help me? You have to be prepared to defend the efficacy of the group model with total confidence. 

The most common objection is the privacy issue. Someone says, I’m a private person. I don’t want to share my labs. Your response should be warm and reassuring. You tell them, I completely respect that. You are never required to share lab results or personal details. What most of my clients find is that hearing other people’s questions actually answers their own questions before they even have to speak up. It’s a way to learn deeply without being in the spotlight.

The second big objection is the need for one-on-one attention. They might say, I think I need you all to myself. Here is how you handle that. You say, I do offer VIP spots, but I have to be honest with you. My group participants often get better results. Why? Because they have 24/7 community support. You aren’t waiting a week to talk to me during a scheduled appointment. You have the group’s collective energy and my team’s support every single day. 

Then there is the fear of falling behind. What if I get busy and can't keep up? You remind them that the program is designed for busy professionals. All sessions are recorded. They have lifetime access to the portal. Most importantly, tell them, We move as a pack. No one gets left behind. 

I want you to actually practice saying these responses out loud. Record yourself on your phone and listen back. If you sound hesitant or like you’re trying to convince them, they will feel that. You want a tone of warm authority. You aren't trying to talk them into something. You are inviting them into a solution that you know, based on the research, works incredibly well. 

Research, like the 2021 study by Geller and colleagues published in the Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, shows that group-based functional medicine interventions often lead to better chronic disease outcomes than individual care. This is because of the social support and the shared learning environment. When you know the science is on your side, your voice stays steady.

Now, let’s move into the Value Stack pricing presentation. One of the biggest mistakes I see practitioners make is apologizing for their price. They lower their voice or they rush through the numbers. Instead, I want you to use the Value Stack method. This shows the prospect exactly how much they are receiving for a fraction of the one-on-one cost.

Here is how you state the price to someone like Linda. You say, Linda, if we did this one-on-one, the investment would be over $2,500 for the three months. But because we are doing this in a group format, you get the exact same curriculum, the same lab review sessions, and the full community support for just one payment of $597. Or, we can do three payments of $225. Does that feel like a manageable investment for getting your energy back?

Notice what I did there. I mentioned the one-on-one price first. This is called price anchoring. It sets a high value in her mind, so when she hears the group price, she recognizes it as the incredible deal that it is. This isn't a trick; it’s a way of helping her understand the massive value you’re providing. 

Here’s another coach tip: State your group price with the same authority as your VIP price. If you act like the group price is a discount or a bargain-basement deal, she will treat the program like it’s less important. Treat it like the premium experience it is.

Now, I want to talk about the math and the scaling potential. This is usually where the imposter syndrome starts to fade and your business owner mindset takes over. Group programs allow you to help more people while significantly increasing your hourly rate. Let’s look at three scenarios.

Scenario A is your Small Beta Group. Let’s say you have 5 participants at $497 each. That is a total revenue of $2,485. If you spend 6 hours on live calls over the course of the program, your hourly rate is $414 an hour. That is already likely higher than what you’re making in most one-on-one clinical settings.

Scenario B is an Established Program. Now you have 15 participants at $597. Your revenue jumps to nearly $9,000. Even if you add some admin time, your hourly rate is now around $895 an hour. 

Scenario C is what we call the Scale Launch. Imagine 30 participants at $597. That’s over $17,000 in revenue for those same 6 hours of live calls. Your hourly rate climbs to over $1,100. 

But here is my advice: Don't try to jump to Scenario C immediately. Start with Scenario A. Run a small beta group. It builds your confidence. It allows you to refine your curriculum based on real-time feedback from those first five brave souls. When you see those five people getting results and supporting each other, your belief in the model will become unshakable. 

Remember, intimacy scales. You don’t need hundreds of people to have a successful group. A small group of 10 to 12 committed participants creates a thriving, profitable practice. This is supported by research into the psychology of community. Thompson’s 2022 work on health behavior change shows that the sweet spot for group cohesion is often in these smaller, more intimate cohorts.

As we wrap up this lab, let’s summarize the key takeaways for your practice. First, always sell the container. People are paying for the accountability and the community just as much as they are paying for your clinical protocols. Second, remember that confidence is your currency. State your price with authority. Third, use that Bridge Technique to connect their pain directly to your curriculum. And finally, remember that you are building a scalable asset. Every group you run makes the next one easier and more refined.

Before we finish, I want you to reflect on a few things. Think about why mentioning that one-on-one price first is so powerful for the client’s psychology. Consider how you’ll respond the next time someone says they’re too private for a group. Think about why validation is always the first step in your script. And remember, you don't need 20 people to start. You just need a few people who are ready for a change.

You’ve done incredible work in this module. You now have the tools to move from a one-on-one clinician to a leader of a powerful health community. You’re not just giving people protocols anymore; you’re giving them a tribe. According to the ethical marketing guidelines from the AccrediPro Standards Institute, being transparent about the benefits of the group model is not just good business—it’s an ethical way to make care more accessible to more people.

Studies in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics have shown that group counseling is incredibly cost-effective compared to individual care, without sacrificing the quality of the outcomes. You are part of a movement that is making functional medicine more sustainable for both the practitioner and the patient.

I am so proud of the progress you’ve made. Take these scripts, practice them, and get ready to launch. You have the expertise, you have the heart, and now, you have the framework. Great work today. I’ll see you in the next module.
