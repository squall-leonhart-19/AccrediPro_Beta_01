Hi, it’s Sarah. I’m so glad you’re here for this specific lesson. Today, we are going to talk about something that makes a lot of practitioners—especially those of us coming from a heart-centered, clinical background—a little bit nervous. We’re going to talk about the enrollment conversation. 

Now, I know the word "sales" can feel a bit heavy or even a little bit "off" when your primary goal is to help people heal. But I want to shift your perspective right from the start. Throughout my career as a Lead Functional Medicine Coach, I’ve realized that the enrollment conversation is actually the very first step of the clinical process. If you can’t help a client make the decision to invest in their own health, you never get the chance to help them actually get better. Without a client, your beautiful systems, your advanced testing knowledge, and your personalized protocols have nothing to process. 

I remember my very first discovery call. My palms were literally dripping with sweat. I had my notes spread out all over my desk. I was so worried about "selling" or sounding like a "salesperson" that I practically apologized for my price at the end of the call. I mumbled the numbers and then immediately started offering discounts before the prospect even said a word. But here is the truth I’ve learned after thousands of these conversations: Selling is simply the bridge. It is the bridge between your client's current state of pain and the vibrant, energetic health they deserve. Today, we are going to practice crossing that bridge together with confidence and authority.

By the end of our time today, we’re going to achieve five very specific goals. First, I’m going to show you how to structure a thirty-minute discovery call so that you build maximum rapport and establish your clinical authority right away. Second, we’re going to learn how to identify the "Gap." This is the space between where your prospect is now and where they want to be. Third, I want you to be able to present your program pricing without a single moment of hesitation or emotional attachment. Fourth, we’ll talk about reframing objections. Instead of seeing an objection as a "no," we’re going to see it as an opportunity for deeper clinical insight. And finally, we’re going to look at the data. We’ll project a realistic income path based on monthly enrollment targets so you can see exactly how this career becomes a sustainable reality for you.

Let’s start by meeting someone I think you’ll recognize. We’ll call her Linda. Linda is fifty-two years old. She’s a high-level marketing executive, she’s married, and she has two kids in college. On the surface, Linda has it all together, but when she gets on a call with you, she is struggling. She’s experiencing what she calls "crashing fatigue" every day at three o’clock. She has significant brain fog that makes her feel "less sharp" during her executive meetings, and she’s gained fifteen pounds of stubborn weight that just won’t budge, even though she eats a clean diet and goes to OrangeTheory three times a week.

But here is the real hook—the emotional part. Linda isn’t just tired. She is terrified. She’s terrified that her brain fog is going to lead to a massive mistake at work that could cost her the career she’s spent twenty-five years building. She feels like she’s missing out on her life because by six o’clock, she’s so exhausted that she just collapses on the couch. She has no energy for her husband or her friends. 

And here is the kicker: Linda has already seen three different doctors. Every single one of them ran standard blood work and told her that her labs were "normal." They told her she’s just getting older or that she’s just stressed. So, when Linda comes to you, she is skeptical, but she is also desperate. When someone like Linda tells you they’ve "tried everything," what they usually mean is that they’ve tried every conventional or isolated thing. They’ve tried a pill for this or a specific diet for that. Your job in this conversation isn't to be the fourth doctor who tells her she’s fine. Your job is to be the first practitioner who looks at how her entire system is working together.

So, how do we handle that thirty-minute call? We break it down into phases. 

Phase one is all about connection and permission. You want to start by acknowledging her and setting the tone. You might say, "Hi Linda! I’m so glad we could connect today. I’ve been looking forward to this." But then, you move immediately into a deep, meaningful question. Instead of asking "How are you?" you ask, "Linda, tell me—what was the specific moment this week where you said to yourself, 'I just can't keep living like this'?" This moves her out of her head and into her heart. It reminds her why she booked the call in the first place.

Once she shares that, you need to set the agenda. This establishes you as the leader of the conversation. You say, "I appreciate you sharing that. My goal for the next twenty-five minutes is to understand exactly what’s going on, see if I’m the right person to help, and if so, show you how we’ll get you back to feeling like yourself. Does that sound like a good use of our time?" When she says yes, she has given you permission to lead her.

Now we move into Phase two, which is defining the Gap. This is the most important part of the call. You have to understand the impact of her symptoms. You might ask, "You mentioned the brain fog is affecting your performance at work. On a scale of one to ten, how much is that impacting your confidence right now?" If she says it’s a three out of ten, you know her confidence is shattered. 

Then, you have to look at the future. This is what we call the "Cost of Inaction." You ask, "Linda, if we don't address the root cause of this fatigue, where do you see your health—and your career—in twelve months?" You let that question sit. Let there be silence. She needs to realize that "staying the same" isn't an option; things will likely get worse. But then, you flip it. You ask, "And if you woke up tomorrow with the energy you had ten years ago, what's the first thing you'd do?" This helps her visualize the "After" state. 

I really want to emphasize this: Do not rush Phase two. The "Gap" is the space between her current three-out-of-ten energy and her desired nine-out-of-ten energy. If she doesn't feel the weight of that gap, she won't see the value in the investment you’re about to propose. You aren't selling a "12-week program." You are selling the bridge across that gap.

Once the gap is established, you move into Phase three: Clinical Authority and the Solution. This is where you connect her symptoms to a functional framework. You might say, "Linda, based on what you've told me, it's no wonder your labs came back 'normal.' Standard tests look for disease; I look for function. We need to look at your HPA axis—your stress response—and your metabolic flexibility. In my twelve-week 'Root Restoration' program, we don't just guess; we test and then we rebuild." Notice how you’re using clinical language, but you’re explaining it in a way that makes sense to her. You’re giving her a reason why the other doctors failed her.

Now, we get to the part that makes everyone’s heart rate go up: the pricing presentation. The key here is confidence. You must state the price as a fixed, objective fact, not as a question. One of the biggest mistakes I see new coaches make is "uptalk." That’s when your voice goes higher at the end of the sentence, making it sound like you’re asking for permission to charge that much. 

Instead, you say it clearly and firmly: "The investment for the ninety-day Root Restoration program, including all consultations, personalized protocols, and daily messaging support, is eighteen hundred dollars. We also offer a monthly payment plan of six hundred and fifty dollars per month. Which of those options works best for your budgeting?" And then—this is the hardest part—you stop talking. You wait for her to answer. The first person to speak after the price is mentioned is often the one who feels the most nervous. Let her process the information.

I want to take a moment to look at the business side of this, because as a career changer, you need to see the data. You need to know that this isn't just a hobby; it’s a professional practice. A thriving practice doesn't require you to have a hundred clients at once. In fact, that would lead to massive burnout. It requires a consistent flow of high-value enrollments.

Let’s look at three scenarios. 

First, there’s the "Slow and Steady" path. This is great if you’re still transitioning out of another job. If you enroll just two clients a month at a fifteen-hundred-dollar price point, that’s three thousand dollars in monthly revenue, or thirty-six thousand dollars a year. That’s a fantastic side income or a great start for a part-time practice.

Next, there’s the "Full-Time Pivot." This is where most of our students aim to be. If you enroll five new clients a month at that same fifteen-hundred-dollar price point, you’re looking at seventy-five hundred dollars a month. That’s ninety thousand dollars a year. At this level, you’re working with a manageable number of people, giving them incredible care, and earning a very respectable professional salary.

Finally, there’s the "Scaling Pro." If you’re really focused on growth and you enroll ten clients a month, that’s fifteen thousand dollars a month, or a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year. 

Most practitioners find that five new enrollments per month is the "Sweet Spot." It allows for deep, meaningful clinical work without burning you out, while providing a very comfortable income. Research in the coaching industry shows that consistency is more important than volume. Enrolling five people every month is much better for your nervous system and your business than enrolling fifteen one month and zero the next.

Now, let's talk about what happens when Linda doesn't immediately say "yes." Let’s talk about handling objections with empathy. 

The most common one you’ll hear is, "I need to talk to my spouse." When you hear this, don’t get defensive. Instead, lean in with curiosity. You might say, "I completely understand. Health is a family decision. When you talk to him, what do you think his biggest concern will be? Is it the cost, or is he worried about you trying another thing that might not work?" 

This is a powerful response because it uncovers the real objection. If she says, "Oh, he’ll think it’s too much money," then you’re actually dealing with a money objection. If she says, "He just doesn’t want me to get my hopes up again," then you’re dealing with a fear of failure. You can’t solve the problem until you know what the real problem is.

The second most common objection is, "It's just a lot of money right now." Again, we meet this with empathy, not a sales pitch. You can say, "I hear you. It is an investment. Let me ask—if we don't do this, and your fatigue gets worse over the next six months, what is the 'cost' of that to your career or your family life?" This brings the conversation back to the "Gap." You’re helping her weigh the cost of the program against the much higher cost of staying sick.

Never take an objection personally. An objection is almost never about you or your worth as a coach. It is usually just a prospect's fear masquerading as a logistical problem. Your job is to be a calm, steady presence who helps them navigate that fear.

Before we wrap up, let’s do a quick mental check to make sure these concepts are sticking. 

Think about the primary goal of Phase two, where we define the gap. Is it just to list symptoms? No. It’s to understand the emotional and practical impact of those symptoms so the client understands the value of the solution. 

Think about that "I need to think about it" or "I need to talk to my spouse" objection. How do we handle it? We handle it with curiosity. We ask what the specific concern will be so we can address the root fear. 

And remember the rule about pricing: Do we wait until the very end of the call, after we’ve already finished the conversation, to mention it? No. We present it as part of the solution, clearly and confidently, before we move into the final logistics. 

And finally, look at those numbers again. To reach a six-figure run rate—around ninety thousand dollars or more—how many clients do you actually need to enroll each month? It’s just five. Five people whose lives you can completely transform. When you look at it that way, it feels much more achievable, doesn't it?

I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to carry into your practice this week. 

First, remember that the discovery call is a clinical tool, not just a sales tool. It is the moment you identify whether a prospect is actually ready for the deep work of functional medicine. 

Second, rapport isn't built through small talk about the weather. It’s built by asking deep, emotional questions that show the client you actually "get" what they’re going through. 

Third, when it comes to pricing, project authority. Present your fees as a non-negotiable fact. This actually makes the client feel safer, because it shows you are a professional who knows the value of your work. 

Fourth, see objections as signs of interest. If someone didn't care, they’d just hang up. If they’re offering an objection, they’re asking you to help them overcome their fear. Handle them with curiosity, not defensiveness. 

And finally, focus on consistency. Enrolling two to five clients every single month creates a sustainable, profitable, and deeply rewarding career path.

You have the knowledge to change lives, Linda is out there waiting for someone to finally listen to her and show her the way back to health. Now you have the framework to make that connection happen. 

Great work today. I am so proud of the professional you are becoming. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
