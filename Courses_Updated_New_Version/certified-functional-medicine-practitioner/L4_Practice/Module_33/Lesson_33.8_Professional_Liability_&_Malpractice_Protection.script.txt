Hi, it is Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you are here with me today. In this lesson, we are going to tackle one of the most important transitions you will make as a functional medicine practitioner. We are moving from the theoretical world of legal boundaries into the practical, high-stakes world of business compliance and sales. Up until now, we have spent a lot of time talking about what you cannot do. We have talked about the lines you cannot cross. But today, we are going to talk about what you can do. We are going to talk about how to build a thriving, profitable practice that serves people deeply while keeping you perfectly safe.

I remember my very first discovery call so clearly. I was sitting at my kitchen table with my notes spread out everywhere. My palms were actually sweaty. I was terrified of two things. First, I was afraid I would accidentally say something that sounded like a medical diagnosis. Second, I was afraid of sounding like a pushy salesperson. I felt like if I asked for money, I was somehow being unethical. But what I learned through years of trial and error is that a great enrollment call is actually an act of service. It is not something you do to someone. It is something you do for them. It is about helping a human being decide to finally invest in their own well-being. Today, I am going to share the exact structure I use to build a six-figure practice. We are going to do this while staying fully within our scope.

By the time we finish this session, you are going to know exactly how to conduct a compliant 30-minute discovery call. You will know how to build high-level rapport without giving away all your secrets for free. We are going to learn how to identify the gap. That is the space between where your prospect is now and where they want to be. I am also going to give you the tools to navigate the four most common objections you will hear. You will be able to handle them with confidence and clinical authority. We will talk about presenting your pricing without that "imposter syndrome" energy that often holds us back. And finally, we are going to look at the real math. We will analyze realistic income scenarios so you can see exactly how a functional medicine business model can change your life.

Let’s start with the psychology of the person on the other end of the phone. Before you ever open your mouth to speak, you need to understand who you are talking to. For our exercise today, I want you to meet Deborah. Deborah is 49 years old. She is a former corporate executive who now works as a busy consultant. She is also a mother of two. Deborah is exhausted. She has been to her primary care doctor three times this year for fatigue and brain fog. Every time, she is told her labs are "normal." But Deborah knows she isn't normal. She feels like she is fading away.

When Deborah calls you, she isn't looking for a list of supplements. She isn't looking for a lecture on mitochondria. A 2022 study on consumer psychology found something fascinating. It found that 73% of high-ticket health purchases are driven by the feeling of being "heard." It is not about the specific clinical protocol you offer. It is about the connection. Deborah needs to know that you see her. She needs to know that you believe her when she says something is wrong. My first coach tip for you is this: Listen more than you talk. Your goal in the first fifteen minutes is to be a mirror. Reflect her experience back to her. When she feels understood, the "sale" is already halfway done.

Now, let’s walk through the actual 30-minute discovery call script. I want you to view this as a four-phase journey. This structure ensures you stay on track and maintain your authority. It also protects your time.

Phase one is the first five minutes. This is where you set the stage. You start with a warm greeting and then you immediately take the lead. You might say, "Deborah, I am so glad we are chatting. My goal for this call is to see if I am the right person to help you reach your goals. I have a few specific questions to ask, and then we will talk about what working together looks like. Does that sound good?" By doing this, you have established yourself as the expert. You have set a boundary.

Phase two is the deep dive. This is the heart of the call. This is where you find the gap. You ask questions like, "What have you tried so far?" and "What is this fatigue costing you in your daily life?" You want to move away from symptoms and move toward impact. If she says she is tired, ask her what she can't do because she is tired. Maybe she can't play with her kids after work. Maybe she is worried she will lose her consulting clients because she can't focus. That is the real problem. In this phase, you must stay compliant. If she asks, "Do I have adrenal fatigue?", you do not say yes or no. You say, "We look at the body as a whole system. We focus on optimizing your stress response and energy production rather than just labeling a single organ." See what I did there? I pivoted from a diagnosis to a functional goal.

Phase three is the bridge. This lasts about five to seven minutes. This is where you explain your process. Notice I said "process," not "treatment." You explain how you work in three-month or six-month containers. You talk about the pillars of your program. Maybe those are nutrition, movement, and stress resilience. You are showing her the path from her current pain to her desired outcome.

Phase four is the close. This is usually the hardest part for new coaches. This is where you state your price. My second coach tip for you is vital: Never apologize for your price. When you state the investment, you must stop talking. Silence is a powerful tool. It allows the prospect to process the value. If you keep talking, you sound nervous. You sound like you are trying to justify the cost. State the price clearly and wait for her to respond.

Now, let's talk about what happens when she doesn't immediately say yes. Objections are going to happen. But I want you to reframe them. Objections are not "no's." They are actually requests for more information or reassurance.

One of the most common things you will hear is, "I need to talk to my husband." When a prospect says this, they are often feeling a bit of fear about the commitment. They are looking for an "out." You can respond with authority and empathy. You might say, "I completely respect that. This is a big decision. What do you think he will be most concerned about? Is it the time commitment or the financial investment?" This gets her talking about her real concerns. It allows you to address them together.

Another objection is, "It's too expensive." This usually means she doesn't see the return on investment yet. She is looking at the cost, not the value. You can pivot by saying, "I understand. Compared to continuing down the path of normal labs and worsening fatigue, how do you value finally getting answers?" You are reminding her of the cost of doing nothing. The cost of staying sick is always higher than the cost of getting well.

Sometimes, a prospect will ask, "Can I just buy one session?" This is a trap. You must be firm here. You can say, "I have found that chronic issues are not solved in an hour. To get the results you want, we need a committed container of at least three to four months." This protects your reputation. If you sell one session and she doesn't get better, she will say your method doesn't work. By insisting on a package, you are ensuring she has the support she needs to actually succeed.

I want to tell you a story about a student of mine named Linda. Linda was 52 and a former elementary school teacher. When she started her practice, she struggled with massive imposter syndrome. She felt like her background in teaching didn't "count" in the health world. She was charging seventy-five dollars per session. She was exhausted, burned out, and barely making ends meet.

Linda and I worked together on her discovery calls. She realized that her teaching skills actually made her a better health coach. She could explain complex biological concepts in a way that regular people could understand. She implemented the discovery call script we just talked about. She stopped selling hours and moved to a twenty-two hundred dollar, three-month package model.

In her very first month using this new approach, Linda enrolled three clients. That generated sixty-six hundred dollars in revenue. That was more than her monthly teaching salary. And the best part? She was working about one-third of the hours she used to work. She wasn't just making more money; she was getting better results for her clients because they were fully committed to the three-month process.

This brings us to a very important point: Presenting your pricing confidently. Your pricing should always reflect the transformation, not your hours. If you charge by the hour, you are a commodity. You are being compared to every other hourly worker. But if you charge for a ninety-day transformation, you are a specialist. You are selling a result.

Here is something that might surprise you. Research shows that clients who pay more are actually more compliant. They show up for the calls. They do the homework. They take the supplements. They get better results. High-ticket pricing is actually a clinical tool for better outcomes. It creates a "skin in the game" effect. When someone invests significantly in themselves, they are much more likely to follow through. My third coach tip is this: Value your expertise. If you don't value your time, your clients won't either.

Now, let's look at the math of a thriving practice. I want you to see what is actually possible for you. We are going to look at three different scenarios based on the package model rather than the hourly model.

First, let's look at the "Slow and Steady" model. Imagine you enroll just two new clients per month into an eighteen-hundred-dollar package. That is only two "yes's" every thirty days. That brings in thirty-six hundred dollars a month. Over a year, that is over forty-three thousand dollars. For many people, that is a great part-time income while they are still working another job or raising a family.

Next, let's look at the "Full-Time Pro" model. In this scenario, you enroll four new clients a month. You have increased your package price to twenty-five hundred dollars because your confidence and your results have grown. That is ten thousand dollars in monthly revenue. That is a six-figure practice. You are helping forty-eight people a year change their lives in a deep, meaningful way.

Finally, there is the "High-Impact" model. This is for the practitioner who has fully mastered their niche. You enroll six new clients a month at a three-thousand-dollar price point. This brings in eighteen thousand dollars a month. That is over two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars a year. At this level, you are likely running group programs or have an assistant helping with the operations. But it all starts with that same 30-minute discovery call script.

Here is my fourth coach tip for you: Your income is a reflection of the number of people you serve and the depth at which you serve them. Don't be afraid of the numbers. The numbers represent lives changed.

Before we wrap up, I want to check your understanding of what we have covered. I am going to ask you four questions. I want you to think about the answer, and then I will give you the explanation.

Question one: If a prospect asks, "Can you cure my Hashimoto's?", what is the most compliant response?
Think about that for a second. The answer is to pivot. You would say something like, "As a coach, I don't treat or cure specific medical conditions. What I do is help you identify the underlying triggers and lifestyle factors that are affecting your immune system. Our goal is to optimize your body's function so you can feel your best." You are staying in your lane while still offering hope.

Question two: What is the primary goal of Phase Two, the Deep Dive, of the discovery call?
The answer is to identify the gap. You need to understand the distance between where they are and where they want to be. You are looking for the emotional and physical cost of their current health status. Without a clear gap, there is no reason for them to buy.

Question three: How should you respond to the "I need to talk to my husband" objection?
The best way is to validate and then investigate. Acknowledge that it is a big decision, and then ask what his specific concerns might be. This helps you uncover if the objection is about money, trust, or the fear of failure.

Question four: Why is the "Package Model" superior to the "Hourly Model" for functional practitioners?
There are two reasons. First, it leads to better client outcomes because it ensures a long-term commitment. Second, it allows the practitioner to scale their income without simply working more hours. It moves you from being a commodity to being a specialist.

We have covered a lot of ground today. Let's summarize the key takeaways so you can start applying them immediately.

First, remember that rapport is king. People buy from those they trust and those who make them feel understood. Spend the first half of your calls listening intently. Use the prospect's own words back to them.

Second, remember that scope is your safety net. Always pivot your language from "treating disease" to "optimizing function." This protects you legally and sets the right expectations for the client.

Third, remember that silence is golden. When you state your price, wait. Let the other person speak first. It shows confidence and gives them space to make a powerful decision for their health.

And finally, always choose packages over hours. Selling transformations instead of time is the key to a sustainable, high-impact career in functional medicine. It is better for you, and it is much better for your clients.

I want to leave you with one final thought. The world needs what you have to offer. There are thousands of "Deborahs" out there right now who are tired of being told their labs are normal. They are waiting for someone to listen to them. They are waiting for someone to show them a path forward. When you master this enrollment process, you aren't just building a business. You are building a bridge for those people to get their lives back.

Great work today. You are becoming a true professional in this field. I will see you in the next lesson.
