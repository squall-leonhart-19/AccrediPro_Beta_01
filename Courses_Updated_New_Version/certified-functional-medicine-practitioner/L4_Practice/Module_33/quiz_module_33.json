            "question": "A functional medicine practitioner who is not a licensed medical doctor (e.g., a certified health coach) uses the phrase 'I can help treat your Hashimoto's' in their marketing. Why does this violate regulatory frameworks?",
            "options": [
                "It violates the DSHEA act of 1994 regarding supplement sales.",
                "It constitutes the unlicensed practice of medicine by using 'treatment' language for a specific medical diagnosis.",
                "It is only a violation if the practitioner charges more than $100 per session.",
                "It is acceptable as long as the practitioner has a 'Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner' credential."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-licensed practitioners must avoid 'medical' language such as 'diagnose,' 'treat,' or 'cure.' Scope of practice laws generally restrict these terms to licensed healthcare providers."

                "Every possible theoretical risk, no matter how insignificant.",
                "Any risk that a reasonable person in the patient's position would likely consider significant in making a decision.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'reasonable person' standard (or material risk) requires disclosing risks that would influence a patient's decision-making process, regardless of the statistical frequency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires health claims to be substantiated by high-quality scientific evidence, often interpreted as randomized controlled human clinical trials (RCTs)."
