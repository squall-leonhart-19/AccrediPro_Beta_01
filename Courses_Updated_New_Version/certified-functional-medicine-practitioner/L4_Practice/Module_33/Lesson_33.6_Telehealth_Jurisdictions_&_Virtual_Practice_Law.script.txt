Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you are here with me today. In our previous sessions, we spent a lot of time building the foundation of your practice. We talked about your Scope of Practice and how to keep your data safe with HIPAA compliance. Those are the essential building blocks. But today, we are going to take those concepts and move them into the digital world. We are looking at how to make your virtual practice legally sound, not just in your own backyard, but across state lines and even international borders.

This is honestly one of the most exciting parts of modern functional medicine. It is incredibly liberating to think that you can impact lives all over the globe from the comfort of your home office. But I have to be honest with you, it is also one of the most legally complex areas you will navigate. We are going to demystify something called jurisdictional authority. Basically, we are going to figure out the where of your practice so you can grow your business with total confidence.

By the time we finish today, I want you to be able to do five specific things. First, you’ll be able to define the Location of Care principle. This is the big one that affects your legal liability more than almost anything else. Second, we’ll look at the difference between being a Medical Provider and a Health Consultant. This is a game-changer for multi-state work. Third, we’ll talk about the legal nexus, which is just a fancy way of saying your tax and business registration requirements. Fourth, we’ll tackle the reality of virtual exams. You can’t touch a patient through a screen, so we’ll figure out how to bridge that gap. And finally, we’ll set up some risk management strategies for asynchronous care and remote monitoring.

Before we dive into the deep end, I want to tell you a story about a practitioner named Sarah. She’s forty-eight, and like many of us, she had a long career as a Registered Nurse before moving into functional medicine. When she launched her virtual practice from her home in Ohio, things moved fast. She was great at social media, and suddenly she had clients calling from Florida, California, and New York. 

Sarah made a very common assumption. She figured that since she was sitting in her office in Ohio, Ohio law was the only thing she had to worry about. She didn’t realize that states like Florida and New York have very strict laws about who can give nutritional advice. They have what we call Red Flag laws. Sarah was inadvertently putting herself at risk because she didn't have the right disclosures for those specific states. 

But here is the good news. Sarah didn’t have to shut down. She just had to pivot. She restructured her title to Functional Health Consultant and started using state-specific disclosure forms. Today, she’s making over twelve thousand dollars a month in revenue, and she doesn’t have the massive overhead of a physical clinic. She’s proof that you can do this right if you have the right framework.

So, let’s talk about that framework, starting with the Location of Care principle. This is the number one legal misconception in telehealth. Most people think their license or their business address dictates the law of the session. That is actually wrong. In the eyes of the law, the Location of Care is the physical location of the client at the very moment the service is rendered. 

Think about that for a second. If you are sitting in Texas and you are on a video call with a client who is currently in Massachusetts, you are technically practicing in Massachusetts. This means a few things for you. You have to follow Massachusetts’ rules on what constitutes the practice of medicine or nutrition. You are also subject to their consumer protection laws. And if a dispute ever happens, the court case would likely happen in their state, not yours. 

I tell my students all the time to make this a habit. At the start of every session, just ask a simple question. You can say, Just for my records, are you still in Massachusetts today? It sounds like small talk, but it’s actually a vital piece of documentation. It saves you from accidentally practicing in a state where you don't have the right credentials.

Now, you might be wondering how anyone manages to work in multiple states if the laws are so different. This brings us to the choice between being a Health Consultant and a Medical Provider. This is the strategy most virtual practitioners use to navigate that patchwork of state laws. 

If you operate as a Medical Provider, your goal is to diagnose and treat disease. That is a heavy responsibility, and it usually limits you to the states where you hold a specific medical license. You need medical malpractice insurance, and you’re ordering labs using an NPI number. 

But if you choose the Educational or Consultant Model, your role changes. Your goal becomes education, optimization, and support. Because you aren’t diagnosing or treating a specific disease, your reach is much broader. You still need professional liability insurance, often called Errors and Omissions, but you are providing information rather than clinical intervention. 

In this model, you aren't ordering diagnostic tests to find a disease. Instead, you’re helping the client use direct-to-consumer testing or co-managing their care with their local doctor. The key here is your Consultant Agreement. It has to be robust. It needs to say, in plain English, I am not acting as your primary care physician, and this information is for educational purposes only. When you use that title, Functional Health Consultant, you are setting a clear boundary that protects both you and the client.

Next, let’s talk about the business side of things, specifically the Legal Nexus. A nexus is just a legal connection between your business and a state. If you have a nexus, you might have to register your business or pay taxes in that state. 

In a virtual world, you can create a nexus in a few ways. Obviously, if you have an employee or an office in a state, that’s a physical nexus. But there’s also something called an Economic Nexus. This happens when you hit a certain level of business in a state, even if you’ve never stepped foot there. For many states, that threshold is one hundred thousand dollars in revenue or maybe two hundred sessions in a single year. 

A survey from 2022 showed that sixty-four percent of virtual health practitioners had no idea they might owe sales tax on their digital programs. In states like Texas or Washington, things like information services can actually be taxable. As you grow, I really recommend using a service like Avalara or TaxJar. These tools monitor your revenue state-by-state so you don’t get a surprise bill from a state tax board. And once you have fifty or more clients in one state, it’s time to talk to a CPA about foreign qualification for your LLC. It sounds intimidating, but it’s just part of scaling a professional business.

Now, let’s get into the practical side of the work. One of the core parts of my R.O.O.T.S. Method is the Reveal phase. This is where we look at the data. But in a virtual setting, physical exams are a challenge. You can’t feel a client’s thyroid or listen to their heart through a webcam. 

To manage this risk, you need what I call boots on the ground. This means requiring your clients to have a local primary care physician for physical exams and emergency care. You are not a replacement for their local doctor; you are a specialized addition to their team. 

You can also use validated tools like the Functional Medicine Matrix questionnaires. These help you collect subjective data that can often point you in the right direction even without a physical touch. And don’t forget about technology. There are so many FDA-approved home devices now, like blood pressure cuffs and glucometers. Using actual data from these devices is much safer than trying to eye-ball clinical signs over a grainy video connection.

Finally, let’s talk about the Sustain phase of our methodology. This is where we look at long-term monitoring. We often use asynchronous care, which is just a fancy term for messaging, emails, or portal updates that don’t happen in real-time. It’s a great way to stay connected, but it can create what I call silent liability. 

You need a clear response time policy. Tell your clients exactly when they can expect to hear from you. Usually, twenty-four to forty-eight hours is standard. You must make it clear that you are not an emergency service. 

Also, be careful with data overload. If your clients are sharing data from their Oura rings or Whoop straps, you need to be specific about what you are actually monitoring. If you aren't looking at their sleep data every single night, you have to say that in writing. Otherwise, if something goes wrong, someone could claim a failure to supervise. Setting these boundaries early isn't just good for your legal safety; it’s essential for your own mental health as a coach. You don’t want to feel like you have to be always on.

Let’s take a moment to recap what we’ve covered today. First, remember that the law follows the client. You are practicing where their feet are, so always check their location. Second, remember that titles matter. Using the Functional Health Consultant model and having strong disclaimers is your best bet for working across multiple states. Third, keep an eye on your economic nexus. As your revenue grows in a specific state, your tax and registration requirements will change. Fourth, use a hybrid care model. Always bridge the virtual gap by requiring your clients to have a local physician for those physical assessments. And finally, set clear boundaries for your messaging and remote monitoring.

I want to leave you with a few questions to think about, just to make sure this is all sinking in. If you are in California and your client goes on vacation to Italy, where is the location of care? Think about it. The answer is Italy. That’s where the legal jurisdiction sits for that session. 

What about the Health Consultant model? Why is it so beneficial? It’s because it shifts the focus from diagnosis to education, which allows you to help people in many different areas without needing a dozen different medical licenses. 

And when does a nexus usually trigger the need for registration? Usually, it’s when you hit those economic thresholds, like one hundred thousand dollars in sales. 

Lastly, why do we insist on a local PCP? Because it ensures the client has a safety net for physical emergencies and exams that you simply cannot perform virtually.

You are doing incredible work by learning these details. I know the legal side of things isn't always as exciting as the science of functional medicine, but this is what allows you to stay in business and keep helping people for the long haul. When you build your practice on a solid legal foundation, you don't have to look over your shoulder. You can put all your energy into your clients.

Great work today. You are becoming a true professional in this space. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
