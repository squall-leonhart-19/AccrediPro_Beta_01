Hi there. It’s Sarah Mitchell. I’m so glad you’re here with me today. In our last lesson, we spent a lot of time talking about the geographical boundaries of telehealth. We looked at where you can practice and how to navigate state-by-step regulations. Now, we’re going to dive into something just as vital, but often much more intimidating: the financial mechanics of your practice. We’re talking about how you charge, how you code, and how you refer for labs. This is about making sure everything you do remains fully compliant with federal anti-kickback and insurance regulations.

Welcome to one of the most critical operational lessons in your entire certification. I’ve worked with so many practitioners—especially those of you transitioning from traditional nursing or clinical roles—who feel that moving into a functional, cash-based, or hybrid model is the ultimate path to financial freedom. And it is. But I want you to remember that this freedom comes with a new level of regulatory oversight. Today, we are going to bridge that gap. We’re moving from clinical excellence to financial integrity. My goal is to help you build a practice on a foundation so solid that it protects your license, your reputation, and your revenue for years to come.

By the time we finish this conversation, I want you to be able to do five things. First, you’ll understand the legal requirements for issuing Superbills and Letters of Medical Necessity. Second, you’ll know how to analyze OIG guidelines so you can avoid illegal inducements or kickbacks in your lab referrals. Third, you’ll be able to distinguish the clear operational boundaries needed for a compliant hybrid business model. Fourth, you’ll know exactly how to execute a Medicare Opt-Out and private contracting process. And finally, you’ll be able to apply high-level documentation standards to justify the medical necessity of every functional test you order.

Let’s start with the basics: Superbills and Coding. Many of you will operate on a cash-pay basis. You might not want to deal with the headache of insurance billing, and I completely understand that. However, your clients will often ask for a Superbill. Think of a Superbill as a very detailed, very specific receipt. It contains the information a patient needs to submit a claim to their insurance company for out-of-network reimbursement.

To be legally compliant, a Superbill isn't just a piece of paper with a price on it. It has to include specific data points. If you provide an incomplete or, worse, a misleading Superbill, it can actually be flagged as insurance fraud. That’s a heavy word, I know, but it’s the reality. A 2023 industry survey showed that about 22 percent of out-of-network functional medicine claims are initially denied simply because the coding wasn't specific enough.

So, what needs to be on there? First, your NPI number. This is your National Provider Identifier. It’s required for the rendering provider and it must match your legal credentials. Next, you need ICD-10 codes. These are diagnosis codes. Now, here is a major point of caution: these codes must be within your scope to diagnose. If you are a licensed provider, this is part of your daily life. But if you are a health coach, we’ll talk about your specific restrictions in just a moment.

Then, you need CPT codes. These are procedure codes, like 99204 for a new patient visit. These codes must accurately reflect the time you spent and the complexity of the visit. You can’t just pick a high-level code because you want the patient to get more money back. It has to match your documentation. Finally, you need your Tax ID or EIN. Please, for your own security and professional standing, do not use your personal Social Security Number on business Superbills. Use an EIN.

Now, I want to speak directly to the health coaches listening. If you are a health coach and not a licensed medical provider, you cannot—I repeat, you cannot—provide ICD-10 or CPT codes. Doing so is legally considered practicing medicine without a license. I’ve seen coaches get into hot water by trying to "help" a client get reimbursed by using these codes. Don't do it. Instead, provide a simple itemized receipt for "Health Coaching Services." Your clients might still be able to use their HSA or FSA funds for this, especially if they get a Letter of Medical Necessity from their primary doctor. But the codes themselves stay off your paperwork.

Here’s my first coach tip for the day: Always verify your CPT codes against the actual time spent during the consultation. If you’re using "Time-Based Coding," your notes must explicitly state the total time of the visit and that more than 50 percent of that time was spent in counseling or coordination of care. This is your primary defense in an audit.

Let’s move on to a topic that is often misunderstood: the OIG guidelines on lab referrals. The Office of Inspector General, or the OIG, is essentially the watchdog for the Department of Health and Human Services. They care deeply about the Anti-Kickback Statute, or the AKS. This law prohibits any form of "remuneration"—which is just a fancy word for money, gifts, or kickbacks—in exchange for referring a patient for a service covered by a federal health care program.

In the functional medicine world, this usually comes up with laboratory referrals. You’ll find that many specialty labs offer "practitioner pricing" or "commissions." You have to be extremely careful here. Let me tell you about Diane. Diane is 52 and a functional nutritionist. She was actually a Registered Nurse for years before transitioning into nutrition. She was offered a 15 percent "referral fee" from a specialty gut-testing lab for every test her clients ordered.

It sounds like a great way to add a secondary revenue stream, right? But here’s the risk: If Diane sees even one patient who is Medicare-eligible, accepting that fee could be seen as a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. It doesn't matter if that specific patient isn't using Medicare for the lab; the mere fact that she receives remuneration for referrals while participating in the broader healthcare system can trigger issues.

Diane did the right thing. She opted for "Patient-Pay" pricing. This is where the lab bills the client directly at a discounted rate, and Diane receives zero financial compensation from the lab. Instead, Diane charges her professional fee for the interpretation of the results. This is transparent. It’s service-based. It’s clinical. And most importantly, it’s compliant.

Here’s another coach tip: If a lab company offers you a "consulting fee" or "marketing fee" that is tied to the volume of tests you order, walk away. The OIG views volume-based compensation as a major red flag for kickbacks. Always prioritize "Patient-Pay" models to keep your hands clean.

Now, let’s talk about the Hybrid Business Model. This is where things get a bit more complex. A hybrid model is when a practitioner provides some services that are billed to insurance—your conventional care—and some services that are cash-based—your functional care. We see this a lot with Nurse Practitioners and MDs who are pivoting into functional medicine but don't want to leave their primary care roots behind.

The legal "Golden Rule" for hybrid models is physical and financial separation. You absolutely cannot "double-dip." What does that mean? It means you cannot bill insurance for a 15-minute "sick visit" and then charge the patient an additional 300 dollars in cash for "functional advice" provided during that same 15 minutes. That is a fast track to an insurance fraud investigation.

To do this right, you need separate appointments. Schedule your functional consultations completely separately from insurance-based visits. You also need separate contracts. Have your clients sign a specific "Functional Medicine Services Agreement" that clearly states these services are not covered by insurance. And finally, maintain distinct records. While you might share a patient chart, your billing entries must clearly distinguish which service was rendered.

I think of Sarah, a 46-year-old Nurse Practitioner I worked with. She was worried about the risk of mixing her models. But by clearly separating her "Wellness Membership," which was cash, from her "Primary Care" visits, which were insurance-based, she actually increased her practice revenue by 40 percent. Why? Because her patients understood the value of the separate functional time, and her documentation was crystal clear about which "hat" she was wearing during each visit. This reduced her audit risk and gave her total peace of mind.

Here’s my third coach tip: In a hybrid model, consider using different days of the week for different services. For example, "Insurance Tuesdays" and "Functional Thursdays." This physical and mental separation helps both you and your staff stay compliant and avoids any accidental "double-billing" of time.

Next, we need to address the Medicare Opt-Out. This is specifically for those of you who are licensed providers—MDs, DOs, NPs, or PAs—who are eligible to enroll in Medicare. If you want to charge cash for functional services, you have a major decision to make. Medicare rules are very strict. If you are "enrolled" in Medicare, you cannot charge a Medicare beneficiary more than the Medicare-approved amount for a "covered service."

If you want to charge your full functional rate to a Medicare patient, you must officially "Opt-Out." This isn't just a verbal agreement with your patient. It’s a formal process. You have to file an affidavit with the Medicare carrier in your jurisdiction. You have to enter into a written "Private Contract" with every single Medicare-eligible client you see. And you have to renew your opt-out status every two years.

I want to highlight a critical legal note here. Many practitioners think they can just use an "ABN"—an Advance Beneficiary Notice. They think, "I'll just have the patient sign this saying Medicare might not pay, and then I'll charge them cash." That is not how it works for a full functional medicine model. An ABN is only for specific services that Medicare usually covers but might not cover in one specific instance. For a cash-based functional practice, the formal Opt-Out is the only standard of care that provides real legal protection.

My fourth coach tip for you: Keep a dedicated binder or digital folder with all your signed Medicare Private Contracts. During an audit, the first thing an investigator will ask for is proof that your Medicare-aged clients knew—and agreed in writing—that you were not billing Medicare for their care.

Finally, let’s talk about audit-proofing your practice through documentation. Whether you are in-network or out-of-network, someone is always looking for "Medical Necessity." In functional medicine, we often order tests that insurance companies might consider "experimental" or "investigational." Think of advanced stool testing or comprehensive organic acids.

Your job is to bridge the gap between the client’s symptoms and the test you’re ordering. I want to teach you the R.O.O.T.S. Method™ for documentation. It’s a standard that helps justify every single thing you do.

The "R" stands for Reveal. You need to document the specific symptoms that justify the test. Don't just say "fatigue." Use the ICD-10 code for "Chronic fatigue, R53.83." Be specific.

The "O" stands for Organize. Link the test to a physiological node on the functional medicine matrix. For example, you might write, "Assessing Biotransformation pathway due to history of toxic exposure." This shows you aren't just "fishing" for data; you have a clinical hypothesis.

The "O" and "T" stand for Objective Data. Cite why conventional labs weren't enough. You might document, "Patient’s TSH is normal, but clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism persist; ordering full thyroid panel to assess T3/T4 conversion." This justifies the more expensive, functional test because the standard test didn't provide the answer.

And the "S" is for the SOAP note itself. Always include a "Clinical Rationale" section. If you ever face an audit, this section is your voice. It provides the "Why" that justifies the financial transaction and the medical necessity of the test.

Let’s take a moment to recap what we’ve covered today, because I know it’s a lot of information.

First, remember Superbill Integrity. Only provide codes if you are licensed to diagnose and treat. Make sure every code accurately reflects the complexity and the time of the service. Don't guess.

Second, maintain a Zero-Kickback Policy. Avoid lab commissions at all costs. Charge for your time and your expertise in interpreting results. That is where your value lies—not in the referral itself.

Third, ensure Operational Separation. If you’re running a hybrid model, keep everything separate: appointments, billing, and contracts. This is your best defense against "double-dipping" allegations.

Fourth, understand Medicare Compliance. If you see Medicare-eligible patients for cash, you must go through the formal Opt-Out process. You can’t just "choose" not to bill them on a whim.

And fifth, always Document the "Why." Audit-proofing relies on your ability to link a clinical symptom to the necessity of a functional test in your notes. Use that R.O.O.T.S. Method every single time.

I want to leave you with a thought. Compliance isn't about being afraid. It’s about being professional. When you set up these systems correctly, you aren't just avoiding a "bad thing" like an audit. You are actually building a more valuable, more sustainable business. You’re showing your clients—and the regulatory boards—that functional medicine isn't just a trend. It’s a disciplined, ethical, and highly effective way to practice healthcare.

You are doing the hard work of building this the right way. I am so proud of the dedication you’re showing to your craft and to your future patients. Take a deep breath. You’ve got this.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
