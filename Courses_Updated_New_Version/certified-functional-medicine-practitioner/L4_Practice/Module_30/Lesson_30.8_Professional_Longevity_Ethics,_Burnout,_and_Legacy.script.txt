Hi, it’s Sarah. In this lesson, we’re going to step into what I call the most transformative part of your business journey. We have spent the last few lessons building your foundation. We’ve looked at the legal structures. We’ve looked at the operational systems. We’ve made sure your house is in order. But now, it’s time to open the doors. We are transitioning from administration to acquisition. This is where your dream of helping people becomes a reality. This is where your bank account starts to reflect your expertise.

I want to start by being very honest with you. I remember my very first discovery call. My palms were so sweaty I could barely hold my pen. I had my notes spread out all over my desk. I was so worried about sounding like a salesperson. I didn't want to be pushy. I didn't want to be "that person." In fact, I was so focused on being liked that I forgot to actually ask for the business. I ended the call, and the prospect said, "Thanks for the tips!" and hung up. I had given away my best advice for free. I hadn't helped her, because she didn't have a plan to follow. And I certainly hadn't helped my business.

I want to save you from that stress. Today, we are going to practice the exact flow I use now. It’s the same flow that allows me to enroll 80% of the people I talk to. You already have the clinical knowledge. You’ve done the hard work of learning the science. Now, let’s give you the business confidence to match.

Our goals for this session are clear. We’re going to construct a professional 30-minute discovery call flow. This flow is designed to build trust and authority quickly. We’re going to learn how to identify and neutralize the four most common objections. We’ll use something I call the Empathy-Evidence framework. I’m going to show you how to present premium pricing—we’re talking fifteen hundred dollars and up—without a single hint of hesitation. And finally, we’re going to look at the math. We’re going to create a realistic income roadmap. I want you to see exactly how many calls it takes to reach your financial goals.

Let’s start with the most important part of the process. This happens before you even pick up the phone or open the Zoom link. It’s the Prospect Profile. You cannot help someone if you don’t understand their world. In this lab, we’re going to work with a profile I call Linda. Linda is a classic ideal client for many functional medicine practitioners.

Linda is in her late 40s. She describes herself as feeling "wired but tired." She’s exhausted all day, but when her head hits the pillow, her mind starts racing. She has gained about twenty pounds in the last year. The frustrating part is that she hasn't changed her diet. She’s still exercising. But the weight just won't budge. On top of that, her brain fog is getting scary. She’s a high-achiever, but she feels like she’s losing her edge at work.

Now, think about Linda’s frustration. She went to her primary care doctor. They ran the standard blood panels. The doctor told her, "Linda, your labs are normal. You’re just getting older. Maybe you’re just stressed." They even suggested an antidepressant. Linda left that office feeling dismissed. She knows something is wrong. She knows she isn't "normal." She’s already spent two thousand dollars on random supplements she found on Instagram. She’s skeptical, but she’s desperate for a real solution.

When you get on a call with someone like Linda, your first job isn't to talk. It’s to listen. Here is a professional secret: when Linda finishes describing her frustration, I want you to wait. Count to three in your head before you respond. That silence is powerful. It shows Linda that you are actually processing her story. You aren't just waiting for your turn to talk. In sales and in coaching, the person who speaks the least often wins the most trust. You are creating space for her to feel heard for the first time in years.

Now, let’s break down the 30-minute discovery call script itself. A discovery call is not a coaching session. I need you to hear that. It is a diagnostic interview. Your goal is to see if you can help her and if she is a good fit for your practice. Research actually backs this up. A 2022 analysis of high-ticket sales found that when the "discovery" phase lasts at least 15 minutes, the close rate is nearly 40% higher. If you jump to your pitch too fast, you lose the connection.

Beginners often make the mistake of giving advice right away. Linda says she’s tired, and the coach says, "Oh, you should try magnesium!" Stop right there. If you solve her problem for free on the call, she has no reason to hire you. You are actually doing her a disservice. A single tip won't fix her chronic fatigue. She needs a system. Focus your conversation on the "What" and the "Why." Explain the root causes. Show her you understand the mechanism of her symptoms. But save the "How"—the actual steps and protocols—for your paid program.

As you move through the call, you will eventually hit the point where you talk about the investment. This is where objections usually pop up. I want you to reframe how you think about objections. They are not "no's." They are simply requests for more information. Most practitioners, especially women, struggle with the "money talk." We have these internalized beliefs about the value of service. But we have to look at the data.

The most common objection is, "It’s too expensive." When you hear this, don't get defensive. Use the Empathy-Evidence framework. Start with empathy. Say, "I completely understand that this is an investment." Then, move to evidence by asking a powerful question. "Tell me, Linda, what is the cost of NOT fixing this over the next twelve months?" Help her see the ROI. Help her realize that her health is the foundation of everything else in her life.

Another common one is, "I need to talk to my husband." This is often a cover for a fear of investing in herself. Again, lead with empathy. "I totally support that. You two are a team." Then, follow up with, "When you talk to him, what do you think his main concern will be? Let’s address that right now so you have the answers he needs." You are turning her into an advocate for her own health.

Then there’s the client who says, "I’ve tried so many things and nothing worked." They are afraid to fail again. This is where you lean into your functional medicine training. Tell them, "That is exactly why we use functional testing. We stop guessing and start using data. This isn't another generic diet. This is a personalized roadmap based on your unique biology."

One of the hardest parts of this transition is managing your own mindset. You must never project your own financial situation onto the client. Just because you might think two thousand dollars is a lot of money right now doesn't mean Linda does. Remember, Linda might have spent forty thousand dollars on a car last year. A car doesn't fix her fatigue. A car doesn't help her show up for her kids. Your program is a bargain compared to the cost of chronic illness.

When it comes time to actually state your price, I want you to use a technique called "Drop and Stop." It is exactly what it sounds like. You state the price clearly. You say, "The investment for this six-month transformation is twenty-four hundred dollars." And then, you stop talking. Do not use filler words. Do not say "um" or "I think" or "it’s usually this much but..." Just be silent. Let the price sit in the air. This demonstrates your confidence in the value you provide. If you start rambling, you communicate that you are uncomfortable with your own worth.

Now, let's talk about the math. I know some of you might be nervous about the "sales" side of things, but business becomes much easier when it becomes a math problem instead of a worthiness problem. Let’s look at some projections for a new practitioner. We’re going to assume a very conservative 25% conversion rate. That means for every four discovery calls you do, one person signs up.

If you are doing this as a side hustle, you might aim for four calls a month. That results in one new client. At a price point of twenty-four hundred dollars, that’s an extra twenty-eight thousand dollars a year. That’s a significant boost for just a few hours of work.

Now, let’s look at a "Full-Time Pivot." If you do twelve calls a month—that’s just three a week—and you sign up three clients, you’re looking at over seven thousand dollars a month. That’s eighty-six thousand dollars a year. For many of you, that replaces your current salary entirely.

And for those who want to build a "Thriving Practice," imagine doing twenty calls a month. That’s five calls a week. With five new clients a month, you are generating twelve thousand dollars in monthly revenue. That is a hundred and forty-four thousand dollars a year. This is how you build a life of freedom while doing work that actually matters.

I want you to keep a simple spreadsheet. Track your numbers. How many people saw your content? How many booked a call? How many signed up? When you see the numbers moving, the imposter syndrome starts to disappear. You realize that if you want more clients, you just need more calls. It’s not about whether you are "good enough." It’s about the process.

Before we wrap up, let’s check your understanding of what we’ve covered. Think about these questions. First, what is the primary purpose of the first five minutes of a discovery call? It’s rapport and safety. It’s making the client feel heard. Second, if a client says "I need to talk to my husband," what is your move? You empathize, and then you ask what his main concern will be so you can address it together. Third, how long should that discovery phase last for maximum conversion? The research says at least fifteen minutes. Don't rush it. And finally, what is the "Drop and Stop" method? It’s stating your price clearly and then staying silent.

I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to carry into your next week. First, always preserve your authority. A discovery call is an interview where YOU determine if the client is a fit. You are the expert. You are the one with the solution. Second, focus on the pain. Use the deep dive to help the client realize the true cost of staying where they are. If they don't change, where will they be in five years? Third, standardize your offer. It is actually much easier to sell a twenty-four hundred dollar package than it is to sell a hundred-and-fifty-dollar session. Why? Because a package promises a transformation. A session just promises an hour of your time. People pay for results, not for hours. And finally, manage the math. Success in this practice is a result of consistent lead generation and a structured process. It isn't luck.

You have the skills to change lives. You have the heart to serve. Now, you have the framework to build a business that supports you while you do it. I want you to go out there and start these conversations. Be brave, be silent when you need to be, and remember that every "yes" you get is a life you are helping to transform.

Great work today. You’re doing the deep work that sets professional practitioners apart from the rest. I’ll see you in the next lesson.

I'd like to dive a bit deeper into the psychology of why the discovery call structure works so well. When we look at the research, particularly the work done on high-ticket health consulting, we see that the most successful practitioners aren't the ones who talk the most. They are the ones who ask the most insightful questions. Think about the last time you felt truly understood by a professional. It probably wasn't because they gave you a thirty-minute lecture. It was because they asked that one question that made you say, "Yes! Exactly! No one has ever asked me that before."

In our context, that might be asking Linda, "How is this fatigue affecting your ability to lead your team at work?" or "What have you had to stop doing with your children because you just don't have the energy?" These questions bridge the gap between a clinical symptom and a human experience. When you connect those two things, the price of your program becomes secondary to the value of getting her life back.

I also want to touch on the "Empathy-Evidence" framework again, because it is the secret to handling objections without feeling like you're in a debate. Empathy is the "I hear you" part. It lowers the client's defenses. If you jump straight to evidence—"Well, my program is worth it because of X, Y, and Z"—the client feels attacked or pressured. But when you start with, "I hear you, and I know that investing in yourself can feel scary," you are on the same side of the table as them. You are a partner, not a salesperson.

The evidence part isn't just about showing them your curriculum or your modules. Evidence is about showing them the path forward. It’s about saying, "In my experience, when we address the gut-brain axis and stabilize your blood sugar, these symptoms start to shift within the first thirty days. We aren't guessing; we're following a proven physiological path." That gives them the certainty they are looking for. People don't buy coaching; they buy certainty.

As you start to implement the "Drop and Stop" method, you might feel an intense urge to fill the silence. Your brain might scream, "Say something! They think it's too much! Offer a discount!" Resist that urge. That silence is where the client is making a decision. If you interrupt them, you interrupt their decision-making process. Often, after five or ten seconds of silence, the client will be the one to speak, and they’ll say something like, "Okay, how do we get started?" or "Do you have a payment plan?" They just needed a moment to wrap their head around the commitment.

Finally, I want to talk about the transition from a "Side Hustle" mindset to a "Thriving Practice" mindset. This is a shift in how you value your time. When you are just starting out, you might feel like you need to take every single person who expresses interest. But as you grow, you'll realize that your most valuable asset is your energy. By using a structured discovery call, you filter out the people who aren't ready to do the work. This ensures that the clients you DO take are the ones who will get the best results. And those results lead to testimonials, which lead to more referrals, which lead to a more sustainable business.

It’s all connected. The clinical work, the sales process, and the financial outcomes. They aren't separate things; they are different parts of the same ecosystem. You are building a professional practice that operates with integrity and excellence at every level.

Take a deep breath. You’ve got this. You are ready to step into this role. I’ve seen so many practitioners make this transition, and the moment it "clicks" is always so exciting. It’s the moment you realize that selling is actually the first act of coaching. You are coaching them to make a decision for their health.

Great work today. I am so proud of the progress you're making. I’ll see you in the next lesson where we’ll dive even deeper into your practice operations. Keep going.

In the world of functional medicine, we often talk about the "healing crisis" or the "herxheimer reaction"—that moment where things feel a little bit worse before they get significantly better. Sometimes, learning the business side of practice feels like that. It’s uncomfortable. It stretches you in ways you didn't expect. But just like in the body, this discomfort is a sign of growth. It’s a sign that you are moving toward a more robust, more resilient version of your professional self.

I want you to think about Linda again. Imagine her six months from now. She’s lost the weight. Her brain is sharp again. She’s sleeping through the night. She’s back to being the leader she knows she is. She doesn't remember the twenty-four hundred dollars she spent. She only remembers that you were the one person who listened to her and gave her a way out of the fog. That is what this is all about. The "30-minute script" and the "income projections" are just the tools that allow that transformation to happen.

When you feel that imposter syndrome creeping in, come back to that image. Come back to the "Why." You are building this business so that the Lindas of the world don't have to suffer in silence anymore. You are the bridge between their current frustration and their future health.

As you go through your week, I want you to practice the "three-second pause." Practice it with your family, with your friends, or even at the grocery store. Get comfortable with silence. It is one of the most powerful communication tools you have. And start looking at your numbers not as a judgment of your worth, but as data points in a fascinating experiment.

You are doing the work. You are becoming a leader in this field. I am honored to be on this journey with you. We’ll talk soon. Great work today. See you in the next lesson.
