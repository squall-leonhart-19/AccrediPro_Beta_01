Hi, it's Sarah. In this lesson, we're going to tackle one of the most important, and often most uncomfortable, topics for any practitioner: the financial foundation of your practice. In our previous lesson, we mastered the art of authority-based acquisition. You now know how to attract your ideal client. But once they arrive, we have to ensure that your business is built on a foundation that is actually resilient. High-impact clinical work is demanding. It requires a pricing structure that prevents you from burning out and gives you the space to do the deep, investigative work that Functional Medicine demands.

I want to start by speaking directly to those of you coming from caregiving professions. If you’ve spent years as a nurse, a teacher, or a social worker, talking about money might feel a bit awkward. Maybe it even feels a little wrong to charge a premium for helping people heal. But I want to shift your perspective right now. Financial sustainability is not a luxury. It is a clinical necessity. If your practice isn't profitable, you simply cannot afford the time it takes to review a complex case. You won't be able to afford the advanced testing your clients need or the continuing education that keeps you at the cutting edge of this science. Today, we are moving away from the old model of charging for your time. We are moving toward pricing for transformation.

By the end of our time together today, you’ll know how to calculate your true cost of delivery, including all those hours you spend when the client isn't even in the room. You’ll understand how to transition from an hourly rate, which essentially turns you into a commodity, to a value-based package model. We’ll also establish clear, ethical guidelines for things like lab markups and supplement margins. Finally, I’m going to walk you through the Profit First framework to ensure your business lasts for decades, not just months.

Let’s start with the Cost of Delivery analysis. The single most common mistake I see new Certified Functional Medicine Practitioners make is underestimating the invisible labor of this work. In a conventional medical setting, a check-up might last fifteen minutes. It’s a quick in-and-out. But Functional Medicine is different. When you are in the Organize phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method, you aren't just talking to the client. You are doing deep detective work.

Think about what happens before the client even hops on a Zoom call with you. You are likely analyzing twenty or more pages of intake questionnaires. You are meticulously constructing a clinical timeline, looking for the antecedents, the triggers, and the mediators that led them to your door. You are mapping their symptoms to the Functional Medicine Matrix to see where the imbalances truly lie. And then there are the labs. Reviewing a complex Organic Acids Test, a Dutch hormone panel, or a GI-Map isn't a five-minute task. It often takes forty-five to ninety minutes per client just to interpret those results and synthesize them into a plan that makes sense.

Here is my first big tip for you: always track your clinical prep time. For every sixty minutes you spend face-to-face with a client, you are likely spending another forty-five to sixty minutes on case review and protocol design. If you charge two hundred dollars for a one-hour session but you actually spent two hours total on that client, your real rate is only one hundred dollars an hour. And that’s before you pay taxes, software fees, or insurance. If you don't account for this invisible labor, you will find yourself working forty hours a week but only getting paid for twenty. That is the fastest road to burnout I know.

Now, let’s talk about why we need to move away from hourly rates entirely. Hourly rates commoditize your expertise. When you tell a client your rate is an hourly fee, you are essentially saying, I am selling you sixty minutes of my time. It puts the focus on the clock, not the result. Value-based pricing, on the other hand, tells the client, I am selling you a pathway to resolution. 

There was a fascinating industry analysis done in 2023 looking at Functional Medicine practices. The data showed that practitioners who used package models—meaning three to six-month programs—had a forty-two percent higher client retention rate than those who used a pay-per-visit model. Even more importantly, those practitioners reported thirty percent less fatigue. 

Think about the mindset shift for the client. In an hourly model, every single session is a new buying decision. They wake up and think, do I really need to spend this money this month? Or can I skip it? They become focused on the expense. But in a package model, they have already committed to the result. They view it as an investment. They are in it for the long haul. 

From your perspective as the practitioner, the benefits are just as huge. Your income becomes predictable. You aren't wondering if your schedule will stay full next week. You have recurring or upfront revenue that allows you to breathe. More importantly, the clinical outcomes are better. When follow-ups are built into a cohesive program, you maintain momentum. You don't have these fragmented sessions where you’re constantly trying to remember where you left off because the client disappeared for two months. It lowers your stress because you can stop selling the next session and start focusing entirely on the clinical work.

This brings us to a topic that a lot of people find tricky: ethical revenue streams. In Functional Medicine, we often manage revenue from laboratory testing and supplements. How we handle this is vital for maintaining what I call the Therapeutic Partnership.

Let’s look at laboratory markups first. Some practitioners choose to mark up labs to cover the time they spend interpreting them. Others prefer to provide labs at the practitioner cost and then charge a separate, clearly defined Lab Review Fee. Both of these approaches are ethical, provided you are transparent. However, the trend we are seeing in the industry right now is moving toward transparent, at-cost labs combined with a specific clinical interpretation fee. It keeps the relationship clean and ensures the client knows exactly what they are paying for.

Then there are nutraceutical dispensaries. Using platforms like Fullscript or Emerson Ecologics is a standard part of modern practice. These platforms allow you to earn a margin, typically between twenty-five and thirty-five percent, on the supplements you recommend. Some practitioners feel guilty about this, but I want you to remember something. That margin compensates you for the years of study it took to understand biochemical pathways. It pays for the time you spent researching supplement-drug interactions to keep your client safe. This is a legitimate revenue stream that supports the health of your business so you can continue to support the health of your clients.

I want to share a story about a practitioner named Sarah—a different Sarah, actually—who was a former ICU Nurse Practitioner. When she first started her practice, she did what most people do. She charged an hourly rate of one hundred and seventy-five dollars. She was seeing fifteen clients a week, which sounds like a lot, but she was absolutely exhausted. When she actually sat down to look at her numbers, she realized that after taxes, her EMR software, and her professional liability insurance, her take-home pay was actually less than what she made back when she was working in the hospital. She was working harder for less money.

She decided to make a radical shift. She stopped offering hourly sessions and implemented a four-month package she called Foundations of Resilience. She priced it at thirty-two hundred dollars. That price included six sessions, but it also included unlimited messaging through her portal and her personalized R.O.O.T.S. mapping process. She decided to limit herself to just twenty active package clients at any given time.

The outcome was life-changing for her. Her monthly revenue stabilized at sixteen thousand dollars. Because the package covered her invisible labor, she no longer felt resentful when she spent an hour reviewing a client's labs. Her clients’ success rates actually improved because they were no longer skipping the crucial Organize and Optimize follow-up sessions. They were committed to the full four-month journey.

To manage this kind of revenue, I highly recommend the Profit First framework. If you haven't read Mike Michalowicz’s work, the core idea is to flip the traditional accounting formula. Most businesses look at it as Sales minus Expenses equals Profit. The problem is that profit is usually whatever is left over, which is often nothing. In Profit First, we say Sales minus Profit equals Expenses. You take your profit off the top.

For a solo practitioner, I recommend four specific accounts. First, a Profit Account. Set aside five percent here. This is your reward for the risk you took to start this business. Second, an Owner’s Pay account. This should be about fifty percent of your revenue. This is your salary for the actual clinical work you do. Third, a Tax Account. Set aside fifteen percent of every dollar that comes in. Trust me, you never want to be caught off guard by the IRS. Finally, your Operating Expenses account. This should be no more than thirty percent. This covers your software, your marketing, and your office costs.

If you find that your operating expenses are higher than thirty percent, it’s time to take a hard look at your overhead. Are you paying for a fancy office space you don't really need? Are you subscribed to five different "shiny object" softwares that you barely use? In the digital era, a lean practice is a resilient practice. Keeping your overhead low gives you the freedom to make clinical decisions based on what’s best for the client, not what’s needed to pay the rent.

Finally, we have to talk about budgeting for your own clinical growth. Functional Medicine is an evolving science. It changes fast. A portion of that thirty percent operating expense budget must be earmarked for your own advancement. This includes things like advanced testing. Every now and then, you should run labs on yourself. It’s the best way to truly understand the patient experience and the nuances of the results. 

You should also budget for mentorship. Even the most experienced practitioners benefit from one-on-one case supervision when they encounter a particularly complex client. And of course, there are the conferences—IFM, A4M, or specialized summits on the microbiome or mitochondrial health. 

I like to use what I call the Rule of Ten. For every ten clients you serve, take the revenue from one of those clients and dedicate it entirely back into your own education. This ensures that you never become a stagnant practitioner. Your clients are paying for your expertise, so you have a responsibility to keep that expertise sharp.

Let’s recap the big ideas we’ve covered today. First, you have to know your numbers. Track every minute of your non-client-facing work so you know what it actually costs you to deliver your services. Second, stop selling hours and start selling outcomes. Packaging your services into three to six-month programs is better for your bank account and much better for your clients' health. Third, embrace the Profit First model. Separate your money into dedicated accounts the moment it hits your bank account. This ensures you can always pay yourself and your taxes without stress. Fourth, maintain ethical clarity. Be transparent about your lab and supplement margins. And finally, never stop investing in yourself. Your clinical knowledge is your greatest asset.

Before we wrap up, I want to leave you with a few questions to think about. Why is that hourly rate model so detrimental to your success? Think about those Profit First percentages—can you see yourself setting aside fifty percent for your own pay and fifteen percent for taxes? Is the way you handle supplement markups feeling ethical and transparent to you right now? And finally, what is the invisible labor you’re currently doing that you aren’t getting paid for?

You are doing incredible work. You are helping people solve health challenges that the conventional system has ignored for years. That expertise has immense value. When you price your services correctly, you aren't just making money—you are ensuring that you can continue to show up, fully present and fully resourced, for every person who walks through your door.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
