Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. I am so glad you are here for this lesson. We have already covered so much ground together. We have looked at your operational tech stack. We have talked about building your care team. Now, we are going to talk about the most exciting part of this entire journey. We are going to talk about how you actually leverage those assets. We are going to move you away from a linear model. We are going to move you away from the one-to-one consultation trap. This is where we transition into a truly scalable practice. This is where you start to create a high-impact business.

For so many of us in functional medicine, the biggest barrier to our growth is the one-to-one model. It is deeply effective. It is beautiful work. But it limits your impact. Your impact is capped by the number of hours in your day. You only have so much energy. You only have so many chairs in your office. In this lesson, I want to deconstruct that. I want to show you how to use group programs. I want to show you how to use membership models. These tools increase patient access. They improve clinical outcomes through the power of community. Most importantly, they build a practice that thrives even when you aren't sitting in the chair.

We have a few specific goals for our time today. First, I want us to analyze the revenue and the clinical benefits of shared medical appointments. We often call these SMAs. Next, we are going to design a three-tiered membership model. This will map directly to the R.O.O.T.S. Method. Then, we will identify opportunities to automate your education. We will focus on the optimize phase of care. We will also develop community-based support structures. This is for the sustain phase. Finally, we are going to look at standardizing your target protocols. This ensures consistency as you grow.

Let’s start with the economics of group visits. Shared medical appointments are not just about efficiency. They are a clinical powerhouse. Research consistently shows something fascinating. Patients in group settings often achieve superior outcomes. Why is that? It is because of peer support. It is because of social modeling. It is because they get more time with you, the practitioner. Think about your typical one-to-one visit. You might have sixty minutes. You are rushed. You are trying to cover labs and lifestyle and supplements. In a group setting, you might have ninety minutes. The patients are learning from each other’s questions. They realize they aren't alone. That realization is medicine in itself.

From a business perspective, this shift is transformative. Let’s look at the math. Imagine you see one patient for sixty minutes. You might charge three hundred and fifty dollars. That is a great hourly rate. But now, imagine a different scenario. You see twelve patients for ninety minutes. You charge each of them only ninety-nine dollars. To the patient, that feels like a bargain. It makes functional medicine accessible to people who might not afford your one-to-one rate. But look at your total revenue. Those twelve patients at ninety-nine dollars bring in nearly one thousand dollars. Your hourly rate has doubled. Your impact has grown twelve-fold.

Many practitioners feel a bit of fear here. They worry they can't provide value in a group. They worry it won't be personal enough. But here is the secret. Eighty percent of what you tell patients is repetitive. Think about the optimize phase. You are talking about sleep hygiene. You are talking about hydration. You are talking about the basics of anti-inflammatory eating. You say these things over and over again. By moving that eighty percent to a group or digital format, you win. You win because you can then focus your one-to-one time on the complex twenty percent. That is the high-level clinical detective work you love. That is where you really shine.

Now, let’s talk about designing membership tiers. A membership model provides financial stability. It gives you recurring revenue. This is the heartbeat of a healthy business. It also ensures that patients stay engaged. We know that functional medicine is a long-term journey. It isn't a quick fix. We need them to stay through the sustain phase. A successful membership should be tiered. It should reflect the patient's journey through the R.O.O.T.S. Method.

The first tier is the foundation. This is for your new patients. They are in the reveal and organize phases. This tier is high-touch. It is high-cost. It includes intensive one-to-one time. It includes those comprehensive lab reviews. They also get access to a foundational digital course. This is their entry point. It is where the deep work begins.

The second tier is the transformation. This is for patients moving into the target phase. They might be working on gut restoration. They might be doing an HPA axis reset. This tier includes monthly group coaching. It might offer discounted supplements. It includes quarterly one-to-one check-ins. It keeps the momentum going without requiring you to see them every single week.

The third tier is the maintenance tier. This is for the sustain phase. This is a lower-cost option. Maybe it is forty-nine or ninety-nine dollars a month. The focus here is community. You might offer monthly masterclasses. You might offer annual re-testing. This keeps patients in the family for years. It prevents them from drifting away once they feel better. It builds long-term healthspan.

I want to tell you about a practitioner named Sarah. She was a fifty-one-year-old former ER nurse. She became a certified functional medicine practitioner. But she was hitting a wall. She was seeing twenty-five patients a week one-to-one. She was exhausted. Her income was capped at eight thousand dollars a month after expenses. She couldn't see any more people. She was burning out just like she did in the ER.

Sarah decided to make a change. She launched a twelve-week group program. She called it Hormone Harmony. It was specifically for women over forty-five. She also moved her existing one-to-one patients into a sustain membership. This happened after their initial six months of care. The results were incredible. Sarah now runs two groups a year. Each group has twenty women. They each pay fifteen hundred dollars. She also has one hundred members in her sustain program at seventy-nine dollars a month. Her recurring revenue is now fifteen thousand dollars every single month. And here is the best part. She only sees one-to-one clients two days a week. She has her life back. She has her passion back.

This leads us to digital course integration. The optimize phase is very predictable. Sleep, hydration, nutrition. These are the foundations. By creating passive education modules, you ensure every patient gets the same high-quality education. You don't have to repeat it manually. You can use a strategy called the flipped classroom. Imagine your patient watches a fifteen-minute video on blood sugar basics before they see you. When they arrive for their consultation, you don't spend time explaining insulin. You spend time on application. You talk about their specific snacks. You talk about their specific lifestyle. The visit becomes about strategy, not just lecture.

You can also automate your onboarding. You can set up a seven-day email sequence. It delivers reveal phase instructions and questionnaires automatically. You can build a resource library. This can be a searchable database of recipes and stress-management exercises. This is a huge value-add for your members. And please, don't feel like you need a fifty-video course to start. You don't need high production value. You need high-quality content. Record your next five one-to-one explanations. If you are explaining how to read a food label, record it. Those become your first digital assets.

Now, let's look at mastering the sustain phase. This is often where conventional practitioners lose their patients. But in functional medicine, this is where we build healthspan. Scaling your impact here requires a shift. You have to move from being practitioner-led to being community-supported. You can do this through community challenges. Maybe you do a quarterly detox. Or a circadian reset that all members do together. You can host expert masterclasses. Bring in a guest speaker on biological dentistry. Or maybe someone to talk about regenerative gardening.

Another great tool is office hours. This is a once-weekly sixty-minute call. It’s on Zoom. Members can jump on and ask quick questions. They get their answers in a group format. This saves you from a dozen individual emails. It also allows other members to learn from the answer. It builds that sense of belonging.

To truly scale, you also have to scale the target phase. This means protocol standardization. You have to move away from reinventing the wheel for every single patient. I know we value biochemical individuality. It is paramount. But the process of targeting can be standardized. You can create clinical playbooks for common presentations.

Think about gut health. You can use the five-R framework as your standard. The individualized variable is the specific microbial strain. You choose that based on their GI-MAP. But the framework stays the same. Think about the HPA axis. Your foundation is adaptogens and lifestyle. The variable is the dosing. You base that on their diurnal cortisol rhythm. For biotransformation, you use standard phase one and phase two support nutrients. You only adjust based on their specific genetic SNPs.

Here is a coach tip for you. I call it the eighty-twenty rule. You should aim to standardize eighty percent of your protocols. This is not about being a cookie-cutter practitioner. It is about efficiency. If eighty percent is standardized, you can spend one hundred percent of your mental energy on the twenty percent that makes that patient unique. This is the secret to scaling. It allows you to grow without losing your clinical excellence.

I want to pause here and check our understanding. Think about the financial advantage of a group visit. It isn't just about more money. It’s about a higher hourly rate for you and a lower cost for the patient. It’s a win-win. Think about which phase of our method is best for a high-volume membership. It’s the sustain phase. That’s where community thrives. Think about how standardization helps you scale. It reduces your cognitive load. It makes it easier to train your future team members. And remember that flipped classroom model. It’s about moving education to the patient’s own time. It keeps your time focused on personalized strategy.

I have one final growth tip for you today. Don't wait until you feel perfectly ready to launch a group. Your current one-to-one patients are your best beta-testers. Go to five of them today. Ask them if they would like to join a pilot group program. Offer them a discounted rate in exchange for feedback. Their insights will help you build the foundation of your scalable practice. They will tell you what they need. They will tell you what works.

As we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve learned. Group programs are a way to increase your revenue while fostering a community effect. This effect actually improves patient compliance. Membership models should be tiered. They should match the patient's journey from high-intensity work to long-term maintenance. Digital modules are your best friend. They automate the repetitive parts of your job. This frees you up for the complex clinical work that only you can do. Scaling requires that eighty-twenty balance. Standardize the common. Individualize the unique. And finally, remember that a sustain membership is the key. It is the key to your practice stability. It is the key to your patients' long-term health.

You are doing incredible work. You are not just a practitioner; you are a builder. You are building a system that can change lives at scale. I am so proud of the progress you are making. Take a moment to think about which of these models feels most exciting to you. Is it the group program? Is it the membership? Whatever it is, start there. Start small, but start today.

Great work today. I will see you in the next lesson.
