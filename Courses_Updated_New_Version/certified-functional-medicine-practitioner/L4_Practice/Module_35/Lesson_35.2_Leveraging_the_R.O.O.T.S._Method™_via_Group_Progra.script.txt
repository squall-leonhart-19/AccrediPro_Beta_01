Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here with me today. In our last lesson, we spent some time really digging into the Practitioner-to-CEO mindset shift. We talked about why it is so critical to stop thinking like an hourly employee and start thinking like the visionary of your own practice. Today, we are going to take that theory and turn it into a very practical, clinical framework. We are moving from the one-to-one grind that leads so many of us to burnout, and we’re stepping into the one-to-many impact of group-based healing. This is where you truly start to scale your mission and your income without sacrificing your well-being.

As you begin to move toward scaling your practice, I want you to recognize that the biggest bottleneck in your business is almost always your own time. You only have so many hours in a week. You only have so much emotional energy to give. The R.O.O.T.S. Method was designed with this exact reality in mind. It isn’t just about clinical accuracy—though that is our foundation—it is also about operational efficiency. Today, I’m going to show you how to transition the heavy lifting of the Optimize and Sustain phases into group environments. This shift allows you to serve ten times more clients while actually deepening their results through community support.

By the end of our time together today, you will know how to design cohort-based programs specifically for the Optimize phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method. You’ll understand how to utilize group dynamics to enhance client accountability and create what we call social contagion for health behaviors. We’ll also talk about money. I’ll show you how to develop a tiered pricing strategy that balances accessibility for your clients with the high-level clinical outcomes you provide. We’ll also walk through the construction of a hybrid delivery model. This is the sweet spot where you preserve those deeply personalized Reveal sessions while moving the rest of the journey into a group framework. Finally, I’ll help you identify and create evergreen educational assets. These are the tools that will stop you from repeating yourself and reduce your coaching hours significantly.

Let me tell you a story about someone I worked with recently. Let’s call her Sarah—yes, we share a name. Sarah was a former Nurse Practitioner with over fifteen years of experience. She was brilliant, but she was hitting a wall. She was seeing twenty-five clients a week for one-on-one sessions, charging about two hundred and fifty dollars per session. On paper, she was doing okay. But in reality, she was exhausted. She told me she felt like a broken record. She was repeating the same advice on sleep hygiene, blue light exposure, and anti-inflammatory eating twenty times every single week. She was bored, her clients were sensing her fatigue, and she had no room to grow.

We worked together to transition her to what I call the Hybrid R.O.O.T.S. Model. She kept her one-on-one sessions for the Reveal phase—that’s the initial lab review and the deep clinical history where privacy is paramount. But after that, she moved everyone into a twelve-week group cohort for the Optimize and Target phases. In her very first launch, she enrolled fifteen women at twelve hundred dollars each. Think about that math for a second. That’s eighteen thousand dollars in revenue for a single twelve-week program. And the best part? It only required one hour of her time for a live group coaching call each week. She went from twenty-five hours of face-to-face time down to just a few, and her income actually went up. That is the power of scaling the Optimize phase.

So, let’s talk about why the Optimize phase is the perfect candidate for group delivery. In the R.O.O.T.S. Method, the Optimize phase focuses on the foundational pillars: nutrition, hydration, sleep, and circadian biology. Unlike the Reveal phase, which requires that deep, bio-individual lab analysis, these foundational pillars are universal truths. Everyone needs to understand how their light environment affects their cortisol. Everyone needs to know how to build a blood-sugar-balancing plate. These are concepts that benefit immensely from collective learning.

When you move Optimize to a group format, you are leveraging what I call the 70/30 Rule of Clinical Efficiency. Here is how it works: seventy percent of what your clients need to know to get better is exactly the same for everyone. It’s the foundational lifestyle work. Only thirty percent of their care is highly specific to their individual labs or genetics. By grouping that seventy percent of educational content, you save yourself hundreds of hours every year. You stop being a content delivery machine and you start being a high-level facilitator.

One big piece of advice I have for you here: don’t try to put the Reveal phase into a group. I’ve seen practitioners try this, and it rarely works well. Clients often feel very vulnerable when they are looking at their labs or sharing their personal health history. They need that one-on-one privacy to feel safe and heard. Keep the Reveal phase as a private, premium experience. Then, once you’ve established that therapeutic bond, you can graduate them into the group Optimize cohort for the heavy lifting of lifestyle change.

Now, I want to talk about the physics of group dynamics, because this is where the clinical magic happens. I want you to understand that group programs are not just a cheaper version of one-on-one coaching. They are a completely different therapeutic modality. There was a fascinating meta-analysis published in 2021 that looked at group-based lifestyle interventions. They found that participants in groups actually achieved twenty-two percent better weight loss outcomes and significantly higher adherence rates compared to those in one-on-one coaching. Think about that. The group wasn’t just more efficient for the practitioner; it was actually more effective for the patient.

Why does this happen? It’s because of something called social contagion. Health is contagious. When a client in your group sees a peer successfully implement a gluten-free protocol or post a screenshot of their improved deep sleep scores from their wearable device, it triggers a normalization effect. In a one-on-one setting, the client might feel like the changes you’re asking for are hard or unusual. But in a group, those changes become the new normal. It reduces the friction of change that often stalls progress.

In a group setting, accountability also shifts. In one-on-one coaching, accountability is practitioner-led. That creates a lot of pressure on you, and it can sometimes feel like a parent-child dynamic. But in a group, accountability becomes peer-led. It’s about high support rather than high pressure. The learning style shifts from passive absorption—where they just listen to you talk—to active discussion and shared experience. This is how you create long-term sustainability.

Let’s move into pricing, because I know this is a sticking point for many of you. One of the biggest mistakes I see practitioners make is pricing their group program too low. They think because it’s not one-on-one, it’s less valuable. But as we just discussed, the community aspect often makes it more valuable for the client’s long-term success.

I want you to use what I call the Anchor Strategy. If your one-on-one Reveal package is, let’s say, fifteen hundred dollars, your twelve-week Optimize and Sustain group cohort should be anchored somewhere between seven hundred and ninety-seven and twelve hundred and ninety-seven dollars. This allows you to maintain your brand’s premium status while making the entry point more accessible for those who might not be able to afford ongoing one-on-one support for six months.

I also highly recommend including a VIP tier in your group programs. This is a simple way to increase your revenue while serving those who want a little extra attention. Your VIP tier might include just one thirty-minute private Target session during the twelve-week cohort. Typically, about twenty percent of your group will upgrade to this VIP level. It’s a very easy way to increase your average order value without adding a massive amount of work to your schedule.

Now, let’s look at how the Hybrid R.O.O.T.S. Model actually looks in practice. This is the model the most successful Functional Medicine practices are using today. It allows you to maintain clinical excellence while scaling your impact.

It starts with Reveal and Organize. This is the one-on-one portion. Your client has an initial ninety-minute intake. You review their labs, you listen to their story, and you create their personalized Matrix. This is where you establish your authority and, more importantly, that therapeutic bond. They need to know that you understand their specific bio-individuality.

Next, they move into Optimize and Target. This is the group phase. The client joins a twelve-week cohort. They follow a structured curriculum that you’ve already built—covering things like gut health, mitochondrial support, and stress resilience. You hold one weekly sixty-minute Q&A session. You aren’t teaching for sixty minutes; you’re answering their specific questions as they move through the material.

Finally, there is the Sustain phase. This is often a low-touch monthly membership. After the twelve-week cohort ends, many clients aren't ready to leave the community. They can move into a membership for maybe ninety-seven dollars a month to maintain their results and stay connected. This creates recurring revenue for your practice and long-term success for your clients.

You might be wondering whether you should use a rolling enrollment or a fixed cohort model. If you’re just starting out, I strongly recommend fixed cohorts. That means everyone starts on the same day and ends on the same day. It is much easier to manage from an administrative standpoint, and it creates much stronger bonds between the members of the group. Rolling enrollment, where people can join at any time, requires a lot more automation and can feel a bit disjointed for the participants.

To truly scale, you have to stop being a content delivery machine. If you find yourself explaining the 5R Gut Protocol or the importance of magnesium for the fiftieth time, you are wasting your most valuable asset: your brain. It is time to create evergreen assets.

Think of this as an asset hierarchy. At the base, you have foundational videos. These should be short—maybe five to ten minutes—high-quality videos where you explain the core concepts of the R.O.O.T.S. Method. Next, you have standardized handouts. These are professional, branded PDFs for things like meal planning, sleep tracking, or supplement timing. Finally, you have what I call the Vault. This is a searchable database of your previous Q&A sessions. When a new client has a question about, say, histamine intolerance, they can search the Vault and find the three times you’ve already answered that question in detail.

Here is a little coach tip for you: don’t over-produce these assets. I see so many practitioners get paralyzed because they think they need Hollywood-level lighting and a professional film crew. You don’t. Your clients value your expertise, not your production value. A clear video recorded on your computer or a well-structured PDF is often much more useful to a client than a forty-five-minute edited lecture. Keep it simple, keep it clear, and get it done.

Let’s take a moment to recap what we’ve covered today, because we’ve gone over a lot of ground. First, remember that group programs are the solution to the time-for-money trap. By leveraging that 70/30 Rule, you can stop repeating yourself and start scaling. The R.O.O.T.S. Method is most effective when you keep the Reveal phase one-on-one for privacy and move the Optimize and Sustain phases into a group format for impact.

Community healing isn’t just a nice idea; it is a clinical tool. Peer accountability often performs better than practitioner-led accountability because it changes the social norm for the client. And by creating evergreen assets—those videos and handouts—you free yourself up to focus on high-level facilitation rather than basic education. Finally, a tiered pricing strategy ensures your practice is both accessible to more people and highly profitable for you.

I want you to think about Sarah, the nurse practitioner I mentioned earlier. She didn’t get her life back by working harder. She got her life back by changing the way she delivered her expertise. She realized that she was the most valuable part of her business, and she started treating her time that way. You can do the same thing.

Before we wrap up, I want to leave you with a few thoughts to reflect on. Why is that Optimize phase so much better suited for groups? It’s because those lifestyle pillars are universal. How could the 70/30 rule change your daily schedule? Imagine if you only had to explain the basics once. How would a twenty-two percent increase in client outcomes change your reputation in your community? And finally, how would a hybrid model change your stress levels?

You are doing incredible work. The world needs more practitioners who are not only clinically gifted but also operationally smart. By scaling your impact, you aren't just helping yourself—you are helping every single person who now has access to your care because you created the space to see them.

Great work today. I am so proud of the progress you’re making. Take some time to think about how you can start implementing these shifts in your own practice. I’ll see you in the next lesson, where we’ll dive even deeper into the mechanics of building your premium practice. See you then.
