Hi, it’s Sarah Mitchell. Welcome back. I am so glad you’re here because today we are going to talk about the one thing that separates a talented practitioner from a successful one. We’re talking about the engine of your business: your enrollment system. 

I want to start by being very honest with you. I remember the first time I had to state my price out loud to a potential client. My heart was racing. My palms were sweaty. My voice actually shook. I felt like I was asking for a favor rather than offering a life-changing service. In fact, I almost apologized for the cost before the client even had a chance to reply. I said the price and then immediately started rambling about how we could maybe do fewer sessions to make it cheaper. I sabotaged myself because I hadn't yet realized that my clinical skills were only as valuable as my ability to get a client to actually say "yes" to the work.

Today, we’re going to fix that for you. You’ve mastered functional endocrinology. You understand clinical architecture. Now, it’s time to build the bridge that brings those skills to the people who need them. Scaling your practice isn't just about clever marketing or having a large social media following. It’s about the internal confidence to lead a prospect from a place of "I’m struggling" to a place of "I am ready to invest in myself." 

In this practice lab, we’re going to walk through a structured enrollment process. We’ll look at how to demonstrate authority, how to handle those tricky financial objections using the "Feel-Felt-Found" technique, and how to articulate the value of a high-ticket package—something in the range of twenty-five hundred dollars or more—with total conviction. We’re also going to look at the math, because seeing the actual income potential of this model is often the "aha" moment practitioners need to finally stop charging by the hour.

Let’s start by meeting our prospect for today. I want you to imagine you’re speaking with a woman named Diane. Understanding the psychology of someone like Diane is the first step toward a successful enrollment. Diane is fifty-one years old. She’s a corporate executive and a mother of two. She is high-achieving, she is busy, and she is currently struggling with what she calls "mystery" symptoms. 

Her situation is one you’ll see often. She’s been told her labs are "normal" by three different doctors. Yet, she suffers from debilitating brain fog. She’s gained twenty pounds in the last two years despite not changing her diet. She’s dealing with 3:00 AM insomnia that leaves her exhausted before her first board meeting even starts. 

Her biggest fear isn't just the weight gain. Her fear is that she’s "just getting old" and that she’s going to lose her edge at work. She’s skeptical of "health coaches" because she’s tried the latest diets and they didn't work. She’s desperate for a root-cause approach, but she’s also value-driven. She has the funds to pay for help, but she needs to know that this isn't just another set of expensive supplements that will end up sitting in her cabinet unused.

Now, here is the key insight for someone like Diane: She isn't buying "health coaching." She is buying certainty. She wants to know that you have a map to lead her out of the woods. When you talk to her, don’t sell the process. Don’t talk about the number of sessions or the specific PDF guides you’ll send. Sell the destination. Sell the return of her mental clarity and her metabolic edge.

So, how do we do that in a conversation? A professional discovery call is not just a "chat." It is a structured clinical interview that transitions into a business proposal. It should take about thirty minutes. If you’re going over forty-five or sixty minutes, you’re likely "over-coaching." You’re trying to solve her problems right there on the call, which actually lowers her incentive to enroll because she feels like she’s already gotten the "fix" for free.

Let’s walk through the script. In Phase One, you’re building rapport and discovering the depth of the problem. You might say, "Diane, I’ve reviewed your intake form. You mentioned that the brain fog is starting to affect your performance in board meetings. Tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how much is this impacting your quality of life right now?" 

Diane might tell you it’s an eight. She might say she feels like she’s losing her mind some days. This is where you have to be comfortable with the silence. Let her feel the weight of that "eight." Then, move into Phase Two, which is future-casting. You ask, "I hear you. And if we don't get this sorted out, where do you see your health—and your career—in twelve months?" This helps her realize that the cost of doing nothing is actually much higher than the cost of your program.

In Phase Three, you build the bridge. You explain the clinical "why" without getting bogged down in too much science. You could say, "Based on what you've shared, it's clear why the 'normal' labs didn't help. They weren't looking at your HPA-axis dysfunction or your gut-brain connection. We need to stop guessing and start testing. Does it make sense why we need to look at the 'why' behind the fog, rather than just masking it with caffeine or more sleep meds?" 

Once she agrees that the approach makes sense, you move to Phase Four: The Offer. This is where most practitioners get nervous, but I want you to stay steady. You say, "Diane, I’m confident I can help you. I recommend my ninety-day Executive Restoration Program. We’ll do deep-dive functional testing, bi-weekly clinical sessions, and a custom protocol. We aren't just fixing sleep; we're restoring your metabolic edge. The investment for the ninety-day comprehensive program is thirty-five hundred dollars. We can do that in one payment, or we have a monthly installment plan. Which of those works best for your budgeting?"

Notice that phrasing: "Which of those works best?" This is an assumptive close. You are assuming she wants to move forward because you’ve already established that she has a problem and you have the solution. You’re simply helping her decide how to pay.

Now, let's talk about what happens next, because this is where the real work begins: objections. Objections are not "nos." They are requests for more information or a manifestation of the prospect's fear of failure. They are a sign that she is actually considering the program. If she didn't care, she wouldn't bother objecting; she’d just say "thanks anyway" and hang up.

The most common objection is, "It's too expensive." When you hear this, don't get defensive. Use the "Feel-Felt-Found" technique. You might say, "I understand how you feel. A lot of my most successful clients felt the same way when we started. It is a significant investment. But what they found was that the cost of not fixing this was much higher. If the weight gain and brain fog continue for another year, what will that cost you in medical bills or lost productivity at work?" You’re reframing the price from an "expense" to an "investment" in her future earning potential and quality of life.

Another common one is, "I need to talk to my husband." Often, this is a polite way of saying "I don't feel empowered to make this decision alone" or "I’m afraid he’ll think I’m wasting money again." You can respond by saying, "I completely respect that. When you talk to him, what do you think his main concern will be? Is it the time I'll be taking from the family, or the financial investment?" This question is powerful because it identifies the real objection. If she says it's the money, you go back to the value conversation. If she says it's the time, you talk about how much more "present" she’ll be for her family once she has her energy back.

Sometimes, a prospect will try to negotiate. They’ll ask, "Can I just buy the labs first?" They want to dip their toe in without full commitment. But you have to be the leader here. You tell them, "The labs are just data. The value is in the clinical interpretation and the ninety days of support to actually implement the changes. Data without a plan is just more confusion. Shall we get you started on the full path?" You’re protecting the client from their own tendency to start things and not finish them.

I want to share a story about a practitioner I worked with named Linda. Linda was a former teacher, fifty-two years old, and she was transitioning into full-time functional medicine coaching. She was a brilliant clinician, but she felt like an "imposter" charging more than a hundred dollars per hour. She was exhausted, working forty hours a week, and only bringing in about two thousand dollars a month. She was on the verge of quitting and going back to teaching.

We did an intervention. We moved Linda away from the hourly model and into a Package Model. She created a "Menopause Mastery" program priced at twenty-four hundred dollars for four months. At first, she was terrified no one would buy it. But she started using the script we just talked about. 

The outcome was life-changing. By enrolling just three new clients per month, Linda grew her revenue to over seven thousand dollars a month. Because she wasn't chasing hourly appointments, she reduced her clinical hours by sixty percent. But here’s the most interesting part: her client outcomes actually improved. Because her clients were making a twenty-four hundred dollar investment, they were more "invested" in the process. They did the labs, they followed the protocols, and they showed up for the calls. Linda wasn't just making more money; she was doing better work.

This brings us to the math of scaling. A 2023 survey of functional practitioners found that those using high-ticket packages—meaning two thousand dollars or more—reported forty percent higher job satisfaction and two and a half times higher revenue than those charging hourly. 

Think about the numbers for a moment. If you enroll just two new clients a month at a twenty-five hundred dollar price point, that’s five thousand dollars a month, or sixty thousand dollars a year. That’s a solid foundation. If you move to four new clients a month—just one per week—at that same price point, you’re at ten thousand dollars a month. That’s a six-figure income. And if you specialize, like Linda did, and move into an advanced niche where you can charge thirty-five hundred dollars, enrolling six clients a month puts you at over a quarter of a million dollars in annual revenue. 

But you can’t get there if you’re trying to help everyone with everything. Scaling requires niching. When you specialize—for example, "Autoimmune Thyroid for Busy Moms"—your marketing becomes a magnet. You stop being a generalist and start being the "only" solution for a specific problem. When that happens, your enrollment calls become significantly easier because the prospect already believes you are the expert they’ve been looking for.

As we wrap up, I want to leave you with a few key takeaways to keep in mind as you start your own enrollment calls. 

First, remember: Sell Certainty, Not Coaching. High-level clients like Diane are buying the result—the energy, the clarity, the vitality. They aren't counting the number of sessions. 

Second, follow the 30-Minute Rule. Keep your discovery calls focused. If you spend an hour on the phone, you are likely giving away the solution for free, which actually hurts the client because they won't have the structured support they need to actually get well. 

Third, view Objections as Opportunities. An objection is a sign of interest. If they didn't care, they wouldn't bother objecting. Use those moments to deepen the conversation about their fears and their goals. 

And finally, Price with Authority. State your investment clearly and then... stop talking. This is the hardest part. The first person to speak after the price is stated is often the one who is most uncomfortable. If you speak first, you’ll likely start justifying the price or offering discounts. State the price, and let the silence do the work.

Your first five calls will be the hardest. I want you to record them. I know, it’s cringeworthy to listen to yourself, but do it anyway. Listen to them and you’ll hear exactly where you lost confidence or where you talked too much. Sales is a clinical skill, just like biochemistry. It requires practice, rigor, and a willingness to learn from your mistakes.

You have the clinical skills to change lives. Now, you have the system to ensure you actually get the chance to do it. You’ve got this. Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
