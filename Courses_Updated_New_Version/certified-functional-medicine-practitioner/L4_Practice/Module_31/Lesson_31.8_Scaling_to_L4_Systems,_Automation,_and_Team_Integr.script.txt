Hi, it is Sarah. In this lesson, we are going to dive into one of the most critical transitions in your entire business journey. We have spent the last few modules building your marketing funnel and creating your digital presence, but now we have arrived at the moment of truth. This is the moment of conversion. This is where we learn how to turn a curious lead, someone who has perhaps been following your emails or watching your videos, into a committed client who is truly ready to invest in their health and their future.

I remember my very first discovery call so clearly. I was sitting at my desk, my palms were literally sweating, and I was terrified. I was terrified that they would ask me a clinical question I could not answer. I was terrified that when I finally said my price out loud, they would laugh or hang up. But I want to tell you the secret I wish I had known back then. A discovery call is not an interrogation of your clinical knowledge. It is not a board exam. It is a deep listening session. Today, I am going to walk you through the exact flow I use to enroll about seventy percent of the people I talk to. You already have the clinical skills, and you have the heart for this work. Now, let us get you the clients so you can actually put those skills to use.

By the time we finish this session together, I want you to feel confident in four specific areas. First, I want you to master a structured thirty-minute discovery call flow that builds genuine trust and authority without you feeling like a pushy salesperson. Second, we are going to identify the primary psychological drivers that actually lead a prospect to say yes to a high-ticket program. Third, we are going to practice confident, empathetic responses to those common objections we all hear, like time and money. And finally, we are going to look at the numbers. We will calculate some realistic income projections so you can see exactly how this work translates into a sustainable career.

Let us start with the most important part, which is your mindset. Many practitioners struggle with sales because they feel like they are asking for something. They feel like they are taking from the client. In Functional Medicine, we have to flip that script entirely. You are not taking their money. You are offering a massive solution to a problem that is currently costing them their quality of life, their productivity, and perhaps even their long-term future. 

Think about it this way. If you knew for a fact that you had the cure for someone’s chronic, debilitating pain, would you feel embarrassed to tell them about it? Of course not. You would feel an obligation to tell them. Your program is the bridge between where they are right now, which is often a place of suffering and confusion, and where they want to be. Selling, in this context, is an act of service. 

There is a big difference between a traditional sales mindset and a service mindset. A sales mindset focuses on features. It focuses on the stuff, the number of sessions, or the handouts. But a service mindset focuses on outcomes and transformation. A salesman tries to convince the prospect to buy. A practitioner uses the call to determine if the prospect is a good fit for their help. In a traditional sale, the seller talks seventy percent of the time. In our world, we listen seventy percent of the time. We do not handle objections with rebuttals; we handle them with empathy and clarity.

Before we get into the actual script, I want to introduce you to someone. I call her Executive Diane. She is a profile of the type of person who is likely looking for you right now. Diane is fifty-two years old. She is a high-achieving corporate manager. On the outside, she looks like she has it all together, but on the inside, she is exhausted. She has gained twenty pounds in the last two years despite not changing her diet. Her brain fog is getting so bad that she is starting to worry about her job performance. She is scared. 

When Diane goes to her primary care doctor, she is told she is just aging and that her labs are normal. She feels dismissed. She feels invisible. Her primary desire is not just to lose weight; she wants to feel sharp again. She wants to fit into her clothes and have the energy to play with her grandkids after a long day at work. Her biggest fear is that this is her new normal and that she is just going to waste more money on another fad that does not work. When you talk to a Diane, you have to understand that emotional weight she is carrying.

Now, let us walk through the thirty-minute discovery call script. This structure ensures you stay in control of the conversation while making the prospect feel completely heard. We break this down into four phases. 

The first phase is Rapport and Setting the Agenda. This takes about three minutes. You want to break the ice, but you also want to establish that you are the leader of the conversation. You might say, I am so glad we are connecting today, Diane. My goal for this call is to hear about what you have been going through and see if my approach is the right fit to help you reach your goals. Does that sound good? This sets the stage and gives you permission to lead.

The second phase is the Deep Dive. This is where you spend about fifteen minutes. This is the most important part of the call. You want to ask open-ended questions. Tell me more about that brain fog. How is that affecting your work? What have you tried in the past? You are looking for the gap between where they are and where they want to be. You want to understand the emotional cost of their symptoms. If Diane says she is tired, ask her what she misses doing because she is so tired. This creates the "Why" behind the investment.

The third phase is the Bridge and the Offer, which takes about seven minutes. This is where you connect their specific pain points to your specific solution. You might say, Based on what you told me about your exhaustion and the weight gain, it sounds like we really need to look at your metabolic health and your stress markers. In my ninety-day program, we do exactly that. You explain the transformation, not just the mechanics. 

The final phase is the Invitation and the Close, which takes the last five minutes. This is where you share the investment. But here is a professional tip: always ask permission before sharing the price. You can say, Would you like to hear how the investment works for the program? When they say yes, they have mentally opened the door to the transaction. It shifts the power dynamic from you pushing a price to them requesting the information.

Now, let us talk about objections. Objections are rarely about the money itself. Usually, they are about the perceived value or a deep-seated fear of failure. Research actually shows that about eighty-four percent of prospects who raise a price objection will still buy once the long-term cost of inaction is clarified. 

When someone says, It is too expensive, do not get defensive. Instead, respond with empathy. You might say, I completely understand that this is a significant investment. Let me ask you, what is it costing you not to fix this? If we do not address this brain fog now, what does your career look like a year from today? My goal is to make this the very last money you ever have to spend on this specific problem. You are reframing the cost as an investment in their future earnings and quality of life.

Another common one is, I need to talk to my husband. This is often a way to delay a scary decision. You can say, I love that you want his support! What do you think he will be most concerned about? Is it the cost, or is it the time you will be spending on yourself? Let us make sure you have all the information he needs to see why this is so important for your family’s future. You are helping her become an advocate for her own health within her household.

When it comes to presenting your price, I want you to practice being confident. State your price and then stop talking. This is the hardest part for new coaches. The first person to speak after the price is mentioned is usually the person who feels the most pressure. Let the silence do the work. It gives the client space to process the information. 

Let us look at a pricing anchor. If you are presenting a twenty-four-hundred-dollar package for a ninety-day transformation, you might say, The total investment for the ninety-day transformation—which includes your initial deep dive, six follow-up sessions, unlimited messaging support, and your customized protocol—is a one-time payment of twenty-four hundred dollars. Or, we can do four monthly installments of six hundred and fifty. Which of those works better for your budget? By offering two options, you move the conversation from "Should I do this?" to "How should I pay for this?"

I want to spend a moment talking about your income potential because I want you to see that this is a real, viable career. If you are working part-time or transitioning from another job, you do not need a hundred clients to make a great living. Most of our certified practitioners charge between fifteen hundred and thirty-five hundred dollars for a three-month foundational program. 

Let us do some quick math. If you bring in just two new clients a month at a fifteen-hundred-dollar price point, that is three thousand dollars a month in revenue, or thirty-six thousand dollars a year. That is a fantastic foundation for a part-time business. If you move up to five clients a month at two thousand dollars each, you are looking at ten thousand dollars a month, which is a six-figure income. And if you really scale up to ten clients a month at twenty-five hundred dollars, you are looking at a quarter of a million dollars a year. 

But here is my advice: do not try to get ten clients in your first month. Aim for two. Master the delivery, get those two clients incredible results, and their testimonials will do the marketing for you. In this industry, word of mouth is the highest-converting lead source you will ever have.

As we wrap up today, let us go over the key takeaways. First, remember to listen more and talk less. Aim for that seventy-thirty ratio. Building deep rapport is about making them feel understood, not about making them think you are the smartest person in the room. Second, use the structure of the script. Having a roadmap gives you safety and ensures you lead the prospect toward a firm decision. Third, price with confidence. State your investment clearly and embrace the silence that follows. It is a sign of professional authority. 

Fourth, always focus on the return on investment. Help the client see that their health is an asset that pays dividends in every other area of their life, from their career to their relationships. And finally, start small. Two clients a month is a perfect place to begin. It allows you to learn and grow without becoming overwhelmed.

You have the tools and you have the heart for this work. The discovery call is simply the gateway that allows you to start changing lives. Practice that script, get comfortable with the silence, and remember that you are offering a life-changing service. 

Great work today. I am so excited to see you start enrolling these clients. See you in the next lesson.
