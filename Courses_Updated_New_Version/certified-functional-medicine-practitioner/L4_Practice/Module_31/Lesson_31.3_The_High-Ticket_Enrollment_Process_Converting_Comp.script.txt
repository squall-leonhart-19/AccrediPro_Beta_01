Hi, it’s Sarah. I am so glad you’re here for this lesson. In our last session together, we took a deep dive into the ethics of marketing. We talked about how to present yourself with integrity in a world that often leans into hype. But today, we’re going to take those ethical principles and apply them to the most critical moment of your relationship with a potential client. We’re moving from the marketing phase into the enrollment process. 

I want to challenge the way you think about this. Most people call this a sales call. I want you to stop using that term. In functional medicine, we aren't just selling a service. We are creating what I call a Prescription for Commitment. This is a clinical shift. We are moving away from the idea of just booking an hour of your time. Instead, we are looking at how to ensure long-term success for clients who are often very complex and very tired.

In this lesson, I’m going to walk you through five key areas. We’ll look at the architecture of a high-ticket discovery call. We’ll talk about how to use the R.O.O.T.S. Method as a diagnostic tool during that call. We’re going to address something called failure fatigue, which is common in chronic illness. We’ll explore the difference between transactional and transformational relationships. And finally, I’ll show you how to construct that formal Prescription for Commitment.

One of the biggest hurdles I see practitioners face isn't actually the science. You’re smart. You know the biochemistry. The hurdle is the enrollment. When you’re dealing with someone who has a multi-system chronic illness, an hourly model is actually doing them a disservice. It sets them up to fail because healing takes time. Today, you’re going to learn how to structure programs in the three-thousand to seven-thousand dollar range. This isn't about being expensive. It’s about providing the time and the resources necessary for true root-cause resolution. It’s about mastering the psychology of enrolling clients who feel like they’ve already tried everything.

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to master a four-part structure for your discovery calls. You’ll know how to use the Reveal and Organize phases of our R.O.O.T.S. Method to show a client exactly what their path to healing looks like. You’ll have strategies to handle failure fatigue with empathy. You’ll understand why selling a program is more effective than selling a session. And you’ll be ready to secure true buy-in for protocols that might last six to twelve months.

Let’s start with the structure of that high-ticket discovery call. I want you to remember that this call is not a sales pitch. It is a clinical assessment of readiness. Your goal is to figure out two things. First, is this client a fit for your specific methodology? And second, do they actually have the commitment required to see the R.O.O.T.S. Method through to the end?

A successful enrollment call should follow a very specific four-phase architecture. I recommend about forty-five to fifty minutes for this. 

Phase one is what I call The Frame. This takes about five minutes. This is where you establish your authority and set the agenda. You might say something like, Today we are going to look at exactly where you are right now, where you want to be in six months, and whether my specific framework is the right bridge to get you there. By doing this, you take the lead. You aren't just answering their questions; you are guiding a process.

Phase two is The Reveal. This is about fifteen minutes. This is a deep dive into their history. You’re using those Clinical Chronology skills we talked about in Module One. You aren't just taking notes on their symptoms. You are looking for what I call the Red Threads. These are the underlying connections between their childhood health, their major life stressors, and their current symptoms. When you listen this deeply, the client starts to feel that you see them in a way no one else has.

Phase three is The Organize. This takes about ten minutes. This is where you summarize their case back to them. I like to use the Functional Medicine Matrix for this. When a client hears their complex, messy symptoms organized into a logical system, something amazing happens. Their imposter syndrome starts to fade. They stop feeling like their body is a mystery that can’t be solved. They start to see that there is a reason for their pain.

And here is a very important coach tip for you. After you summarize their case in this phase, I want you to stop talking. Just be silent. Let the client sit with the realization that someone finally understands the why behind their symptoms. This silence builds more trust than any sales script ever could. It gives them space to breathe and to realize that they are finally in the right place.

Finally, phase four is The Prescription. This is about fifteen minutes. This is where you present the solution. Notice I didn't say you present your hours or your price. You are presenting the outcome and the support system. You’re showing them exactly how you will walk with them through the next several months.

Now, let’s talk about using R.O.O.T.S. as a diagnostic sales tool. I know many practitioners struggle to explain why their program costs five thousand dollars when the nutritionist down the street charges a hundred and fifty dollars an hour. The answer is in the depth of the work. When you walk a client through the phases of R.O.O.T.S., you aren't just talking about health; you’re demonstrating a higher level of care.

In the Reveal phase, you explain the advanced functional labs you’ll use. Maybe it’s the GI-MAP, the DUTCH test, or an Organic Acids Test. When you explain these, the client thinks, Okay, they aren't just guessing based on my symptoms. They are looking at my unique biology.

In the Organize phase, you show them the connections. You show them how their brain fog and their bloating aren't two separate problems. They are connected via the Matrix. The client starts to realize their symptoms aren't random. There is a logical pattern, and you have the map.

In the Optimize phase, you highlight the foundational lifestyle support. You talk about sleep and circadian rhythms. This shows them that you care about their daily life, not just which supplements they are taking. It feels comprehensive.

And in the Target phase, you discuss the specific, data-driven protocols. They see that this is a personalized roadmap, not some generic protocol they could have found on a blog. This differentiation is what justifies the investment.

I want to spend some time now on a concept that is very close to my heart: overcoming failure fatigue. Most complex clients arrive at your door after seeing five, ten, maybe even fifteen other practitioners. They are suffering from failure fatigue. This is the deep-seated belief that nothing is ever going to work for them. When they bring up financial concerns, it’s rarely just about the money. It’s usually about protection. They are trying to protect themselves from another disappointment. They don't want to spend more money only to end up exactly where they started.

When a client says, I’ve tried everything, you have to reframe that experience for them. You might say, I hear you. And I can see how much work you’ve put in. You’ve tried many great things, but you’ve tried them in isolation. It’s like having all the right ingredients for a beautiful cake but trying to bake them one at a time. The R.O.O.T.S. Method is the oven and the recipe that brings all those ingredients together at the same time. This reframe helps them see that their past failures weren't because they are broken, but because the approach was fragmented.

Let me tell you a story about a client named Sarah. Not me, but a client I worked with. Sarah came to me with a diagnosis of Hashimoto’s, chronic fatigue, and mold illness. She had already spent twelve thousand dollars on various health gurus and protocols with almost no results. She was skeptical, tired, and honestly, she was heartbroken.

When we did our discovery call, I didn't try to sell her a consultation. I didn't talk about my hourly rate. I presented a six-month Metabolic Restoration Program for fifty-five hundred dollars. During the Organize phase of our call, I used the Matrix to show her how her mold exposure was the specific trigger for her HPA-axis dysfunction. I showed her how her thyroid wasn't the primary problem, but a victim of the environment.

Sarah told me later that she felt heard for the first time in ten years. She enrolled immediately. She said the structure of the program gave her more confidence than the specific labs did. She knew there was a plan. Today, Sarah is one of my biggest advocates. She refers three new clients to my practice every single month because she believes in the process.

When you encounter a financial objection, I want you to resist the urge to jump straight to a payment plan. First, validate the fear. You might say, I understand that this is a significant investment. Let me ask you, is the concern the dollar amount itself, or is it the fear that this might be another thing that doesn't work? This gets to the heart of the issue. If it’s the fear of failure, no discount in the world will make them sign up. You have to address the trust first.

This brings us to the psychology of high-ticket sales. To succeed as a certified practitioner, you have to move from transactional thinking to transformational thinking. There was a survey done in 2023 of functional medicine practices. It showed that practitioners who used program-based pricing had a forty percent higher client success rate than those using hourly billing. Think about that. Forty percent. Why? Because the program provides the container for the work to actually happen.

I always say: Sell the destination, not the plane. Your clients don't actually want three hours of coaching or a stack of lab reports. They want to be able to play with their grandkids. They want to work a full day without a migraine. They want to feel like themselves again. When you’re in that enrollment call, focus on the life after the program. That is the transformation they are paying for.

And here is a truth that might be uncomfortable: High price often leads to high compliance. When clients pay, they pay attention. A high-ticket price filters for the clients who are psychologically ready to do the hard work. Lifestyle change is difficult. If someone isn't invested, they are much more likely to quit when the elimination diet gets tough or when they have to change their sleep habits.

Now, let’s look at the final piece of the puzzle: The Prescription for Commitment. This is the formal agreement that ends the discovery call. It can be verbal, but I prefer to have it in writing as well. It outlines exactly what you will do and exactly what the client must do.

As the practitioner, your commitment is clear. You provide the clinical roadmap. You interpret the labs. You provide high-level support to navigate the obstacles that will inevitably come up. 

But the client has a commitment too. They have to prioritize their sleep. They have to follow the diet for the full thirty days. They have to be honest when they struggle. 

I like to ask a very specific question at the end of the call. I ask, On a scale of one to ten, how committed are you to resolving this right now? If they say anything less than an eight, I do not enroll them. I’ll ask, What would it take to get you to a ten? This is how you handle objections before the program even starts. You want a ten-out-of-ten commitment because that is what it takes to heal.

I also want to talk to those of you who might be transitioning from a traditional job, like nursing or teaching. Maybe you’re making sixty thousand dollars a year right now. If you enroll just two clients a month into a forty-five hundred dollar program, that is over a hundred thousand dollars in annual revenue. This model doesn't just help the client; it gives you the financial freedom to spend more time with each person. You aren't rushing through twenty appointments a day. You have the space to be the practitioner they truly need.

One practical tip for your discovery calls: always have a visual process map ready. If you’re on a Zoom call, share your screen and show them the R.O.O.T.S. journey. When people can see the journey, it reduces their anxiety about the unknown. It makes the path feel real and achievable.

So, let’s summarize what we’ve covered today. High-ticket enrollment isn't a luxury; it’s a clinical necessity for complex cases. It provides the dosage of time required for real healing. Your discovery call should be an assessment of readiness, not a high-pressure pitch. You can use the R.O.O.T.S. Method as a visual roadmap to show your value and differentiate yourself from fragmented care. Remember to address failure fatigue with deep empathy. Validate their past disappointments while offering a new, integrated framework. And finally, remember that commitment is a two-way street. Ensure your client is a ten-out-of-ten in readiness before you start the journey together.

You are doing work that matters. You are offering hope to people who have lost it. When you master this enrollment process, you aren't just building a business—you’re building a bridge to health for the people who need it most.

Great work today. I’ll see you in the next lesson.
