            "options": [
                "Sole Proprietorship",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Limited Liability Company (LLC) offers personal asset protection from business debts and liabilities, making it a popular choice for solo practitioners seeking a balance between simplicity and legal protection. Sole Proprietorships offer no such protection, while S-Corporations involve more complex tax and operational requirements."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is a legally required contract under HIPAA that specifies how a Business Associate (the third-party vendor) will protect Protected Health Information (PHI) on behalf of the Covered Entity (the coach's practice). This is crucial for maintaining compliance when using external services that handle client data."

            "question": "A common mistake for new breastfeeding support coaches when setting pricing is focusing solely on direct hourly costs. What is a more effective long-term strategy that aligns with premium service delivery and client retention?",
