            "question": "A client asks their Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach (CBSC) for advice on whether to discontinue a prescribed medication due to concerns about its impact on milk supply. What is the CBSC's most appropriate response within their professional scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the client on potential herbal alternatives to the medication.",
                "Recommend a specific dosage adjustment for the medication.",
                "Educate the client on evidence-based information regarding the medication's compatibility with breastfeeding and advise them to consult their prescribing physician.",
                "Suggest the client stop the medication for 24 hours to observe changes in milk supply."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A CBSC operates within a defined scope of practice that does not include medical diagnosis or prescribing/discontinuing medications. The appropriate action is to provide evidence-based information and refer the client to their medical provider for medication-related decisions."

            "question": "A CBSC needs to communicate sensitive client information, such as Protected Health Information (PHI), to a referring physician. Which of the following practices best adheres to data privacy standards like HIPAA and ensures digital security?",
            "options": [
                "Sending an unencrypted email with all client details, assuming the client has given verbal consent.",
                "Discussing the client's case over a standard, non-secure phone call in a public place.",
                "Utilizing a HIPAA-compliant, encrypted electronic health record (EHR) system or secure messaging platform after obtaining the client's written consent for information sharing.",
                "Sharing the client's information in a private social media group for healthcare professionals to solicit advice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HIPAA and other data privacy regulations mandate the use of secure, encrypted channels for transmitting PHI. Written consent is crucial, and platforms must be specifically designed to be compliant, unlike standard email or social media."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Valid informed consent requires the client to be fully informed about the services, including benefits, risks, and alternatives, and to voluntarily agree after demonstrating understanding. It is a process, not just a signature."

                "It covers legal defense costs and potential damages resulting from claims of negligence, errors, or omissions in professional service.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional liability insurance is crucial for CBSCs as it provides financial protection against legal claims alleging professional misconduct, errors, or negligence, covering legal fees and settlements. While not universally legally mandated, it is a critical risk management strategy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "During a home visit, a CBSC observes several concerning signs indicating potential neglect of an infant, such as severe, untreated diaper rash, significant weight loss since the last visit despite feeding support, and an unkempt, unsafe home environment. What is the CBSC's primary ethical and legal obligation as a mandated reporter?",
            "options": [
                "Confront the parents immediately and demand they address the issues.",
                "Document the observations and continue to monitor the situation over several more visits, offering additional support.",
                "Offer additional support services without reporting, assuming the parents will improve.",
                "Report the suspected neglect to the appropriate child protective services agency or law enforcement, following local mandated reporting protocols."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "As mandated reporters, CBSCs have a legal and ethical obligation to report suspected child abuse or neglect to the relevant authorities. Delaying or attempting to resolve the situation independently can put the child at further risk and lead to legal repercussions for the CBSC."

            "question": "A company producing infant formula launches a new marketing campaign featuring health professionals distributing free samples of formula to new mothers in hospitals and promoting formula as 'equal to breast milk.' This practice directly violates which core principle of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (WHO Code)?",
            "options": [
                "The principle of promoting breastfeeding over all other feeding methods.",

                "The mandate for independent research on infant feeding products."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The WHO Code strictly prohibits the distribution of free samples of breast-milk substitutes to mothers, and marketing claims that imply formula is equivalent to breast milk are also in direct violation, as they undermine breastfeeding."

        {
            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "A client expresses a strong desire to exclusively breastfeed, but due to a significant, acute medical complication, their infant requires supplemental feeding with formula for a short period. The client is distressed and feels like a failure. Applying the bioethical principle of <span class=\"highlight\">autonomy</span>, how should the CBSC best support the client while also considering beneficence for the infant?",
            "options": [
                "Strongly advise the client that formula is necessary and they must accept it, overriding their emotional distress.",
                "Respect the client's feelings, provide accurate information on safe formula preparation and methods to maintain milk supply, and collaboratively explore a feeding plan that respects her informed choice and emotional well-being while ensuring infant health.",
                "Insist on continuing only breastfeeding, even if it compromises the infant's immediate health needs.",
                "Refer the client to a mental health professional without addressing the feeding issue further, stating it's 'beyond scope.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Upholding autonomy means respecting the client's choices and feelings. In a complex situation, the CBSC's role is to provide compassionate, evidence-based information, explore options collaboratively, and support the client's decision-making, balancing maternal autonomy with infant beneficence. Dismissing feelings or dictating choices violates autonomy."

                "To guarantee specific breastfeeding outcomes for the client.",
                "To outline the scope of services, fees, cancellation policy, confidentiality, payment terms, and responsibilities of both parties, ensuring clear expectations.",
                "To serve primarily as a marketing tool to attract more clients.",
                "To establish a legal partnership between the CBSC and the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A professional service agreement is a vital legal document that sets clear expectations, defines the boundaries of the professional relationship, and protects both the CBSC and the client by formalizing the terms of engagement."

            "question": "In the context of legal record keeping for a CBSC, what is the generally recommended minimum retention period for client records, and why is this standard important?",
            "options": [
                "1 year; to save storage space and reduce clutter.",
                "3 years; to comply with basic administrative guidelines for financial records.",
                "7-10 years (or longer, depending on jurisdiction, specific regulations, and client age); to allow for potential legal challenges, audits, future client needs, and professional accountability.",
                "Indefinitely; because all records are always relevant and should never be destroyed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The retention period for client records varies by jurisdiction and profession, but generally ranges from 7 to 10 years after the last client contact, or even longer for minors (until adulthood plus several years). This ensures records are available for legal defense, audits, or if the client requires them in the future."
