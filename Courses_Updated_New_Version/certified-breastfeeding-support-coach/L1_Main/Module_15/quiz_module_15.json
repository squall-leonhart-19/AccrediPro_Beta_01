            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A client presents with persistent nipple pain and reports hearing clicking sounds during feeding. Upon observation, the infant's lips appear tucked in, and the latch seems shallow. As per the 'Assess & Align' principles, what is the most likely biomechanical issue contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive milk flow causing infant gulping",
                "Ineffective positioning leading to a shallow latch and poor lip flanging",
                "Maternal anxiety inhibiting the let-down reflex",
                "Infant preference for one breast over the other"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clicking sounds, tucked lips, and nipple pain are classic indicators of a shallow or ineffective latch, often due to suboptimal positioning that prevents the infant from achieving a wide gape and proper lip flanging, leading to nipple trauma and inefficient milk transfer."

            "question": "A coach observes an infant struggling to transfer milk effectively, showing poor weight gain despite frequent feeds, and the mother describes the infant's tongue as 'heart-shaped' when crying. The coach suspects a physiological barrier. What is the most appropriate action for the coach within their scope of practice, as outlined in 'Troubleshoot & Target'?",
            "options": [
                "Advise specific oral exercises to improve tongue mobility.",
                "Recommend a specific type of bottle and formula to supplement feeding.",
                "Suggest a referral to a qualified healthcare professional, such as a lactation consultant or pediatric dentist, for a comprehensive oral assessment.",
                "Instruct the mother to use a nipple shield to facilitate latch."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Symptoms like poor weight gain, ineffective milk transfer, and a 'heart-shaped' tongue are strong indicators of a potential tongue tie or other oral restriction. Diagnosing and treating such conditions falls outside the scope of a breastfeeding support coach, necessitating a referral to a specialist."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, crucial for the let-down reflex, is highly sensitive to stress. Strategies like warmth, massage, skin-to-skin contact, and a calm environment promote relaxation and oxytocin release, facilitating a more effective let-down."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Breastfeeding support coaches operate within a defined scope of practice that explicitly excludes medical diagnosis and treatment. The ethical and professional response is to refer medical concerns to appropriate healthcare professionals."
