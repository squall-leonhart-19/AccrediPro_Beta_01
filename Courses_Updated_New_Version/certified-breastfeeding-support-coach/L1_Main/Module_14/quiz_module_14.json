            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client reports persistent nipple pain, blanching of the nipple after feeds, and a clicking sound during her baby's suckling. These symptoms most strongly indicate which of the following mechanical issues?",
            "options": [
                "An oversupply of milk.",
                "A deep, effective latch.",
                "A shallow or compromised latch.",
                "Engorgement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nipple pain, blanching, and clicking are classic signs of a shallow latch, where the baby is not taking enough breast tissue into their mouth, leading to nipple compression and inefficient milk transfer."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A 3-week-old infant exhibits poor weight gain, takes unusually long to feed (45-60 minutes), and frequently pulls off the breast frustrated. Upon oral assessment, the coach notes a tight frenulum restricting tongue elevation and protrusion. This presentation strongly suggests which physiological barrier?",
            "options": [
                "Mastitis.",
                "Flat or inverted nipples.",
                "An anterior tongue-tie (ankyloglossia).",
                "Thrush."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The description of restricted tongue movement, prolonged feeds, and poor weight gain are classic indicators of an anterior tongue-tie, which significantly impairs a baby's ability to latch deeply and effectively transfer milk."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A mother reports feeling extremely anxious and overwhelmed since childbirth, which she believes is hindering her milk let-down reflex. From a hormonal perspective, which hormone's release is most likely being inhibited by her stress, impacting milk flow?",
            "options": [
                "Prolactin.",
                "Estrogen.",
                "Oxytocin.",
                "Dopamine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is the hormone responsible for the milk ejection reflex (let-down). Stress and anxiety can inhibit oxytocin release, making it harder for milk to flow freely. Prolactin is primarily responsible for milk production."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "A breastfeeding mother asks for nutritional advice to support her milk supply and overall well-being. Which of the following recommendations is most evidence-based for a Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach™ to provide?",
            "options": [
                "Strictly limiting fluid intake to avoid oversupply.",
                "Increasing caloric intake by approximately 300-500 calories per day with nutrient-dense foods.",
                "Eliminating all dairy products from her diet as a precautionary measure.",
                "Consuming large quantities of fenugreek supplements without other dietary changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breastfeeding requires additional energy, and an increase of 300-500 nutrient-dense calories per day is a standard recommendation to support milk production and maternal energy levels."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A client, Maria, reports her 5-day-old infant is frequently fussy at the breast, and she feels her breasts are still very full after feeds. She also notes fewer wet diapers than expected. Applying the L.A.T.C.H. framework, what would be the MOST appropriate initial step for the coach to take?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately recommend supplementing with formula.",
                "Advise Maria to pump after every feed to increase supply.",
                "Observe a full feeding session to assess the latch and milk transfer dynamics.",
                "Suggest Maria switch to exclusive bottle feeding temporarily."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The L.A.T.C.H. method emphasizes direct observation ('Assess & Align') to understand the mechanics of feeding and identify issues like ineffective milk transfer, which the symptoms suggest. Supplementing or pumping are not initial diagnostic steps."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A client asks her Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach™ for advice on diagnosing a potential dairy allergy in her baby, as the baby is experiencing frequent spit-up and gas. What is the most ethically appropriate response for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest specific dietary eliminations for the mother to try.",
                "Recommend an over-the-counter medication for the baby's symptoms.",
                "Advise the client to consult with their pediatrician for diagnosis and medical management.",
                "Provide a list of online forums where mothers discuss dairy allergies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diagnosing medical conditions like allergies and recommending specific dietary eliminations or medications falls outside the scope of practice for a breastfeeding support coach. The coach's ethical responsibility is to refer the client to a qualified medical professional."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "When observing an infant latch at the breast, which visual cue is most indicative of a deep, effective latch that optimizes milk transfer?",
            "options": [
                "The infant's lips are inverted, forming a tight seal around the nipple.",
                "The infant's mouth is wide open, with lips flanged outward and the chin deeply indented into the breast.",
                "The infant's cheeks are visibly sucked in, creating dimples.",
                "The infant is primarily sucking on the nipple, with minimal areola in the mouth."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A deep, effective latch is characterized by a wide-open mouth, flanged lips, and the chin deeply pressed into the breast, allowing the infant to compress the milk ducts effectively and transfer milk efficiently. Sucked-in cheeks or only nipple in the mouth indicate a shallow latch."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A coach is working with a mother whose infant has been diagnosed with a significant posterior tongue-tie, leading to severe feeding difficulties. Studies suggest that approximately <span class=\"stat-highlight\">25-30%</span> of infants with moderate to severe ankyloglossia may require a frenotomy to improve feeding mechanics. Based on this information and the coach's scope of practice, what is the most appropriate action?",
            "options": [
                "Perform a frenotomy if the coach feels competent.",
                "Advise the mother that a frenotomy is absolutely necessary.",
                "Refer the mother to a pediatric dentist or ENT for evaluation and discussion of treatment options.",
                "Recommend waiting until the infant is older to see if the issue resolves spontaneously."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Performing medical procedures like frenotomies or making definitive medical diagnoses falls outside the scope of practice for a breastfeeding support coach. The appropriate action is always to refer to a qualified medical professional (pediatric dentist or ENT) for diagnosis, treatment options, and medical management, especially when a significant physiological barrier is identified."
