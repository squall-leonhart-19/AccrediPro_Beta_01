            "question": "During a trauma-informed intake, a client mentions a past difficult birth experience. Which active listening technique is most appropriate to encourage further sharing while maintaining safety and trust?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately offer solutions to their current feeding challenge to distract from the trauma.",
                "Reframe their experience with a positive spin to help them move past it quickly.",
                "Use reflective statements like 'It sounds like that was a very challenging time for you,' and allow for comfortable silence.",
                "Share a similar personal experience to build rapport and show empathy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a trauma-informed approach, validating the client's experience through reflective statements and providing space with silence allows them to control the pace of disclosure, fostering a sense of safety and autonomy. Offering solutions, reframing, or sharing personal experiences can inadvertently minimize their feelings or shift the focus away from their needs."

            "question": "A client reports a history of gestational hypertension during pregnancy, managed with medication, and also experienced a significant postpartum hemorrhage. How might this maternal clinical history be relevant to a breastfeeding support coach?",
            "options": [
                "These factors are primarily medical and generally irrelevant to breastfeeding outcomes.",
                "They suggest the mother is at increased risk for mastitis due to compromised immune function.",
                "Both gestational hypertension and postpartum hemorrhage can be associated with delayed lactogenesis II or lower milk volume.",
                "This history indicates a high likelihood of an infant with poor latch due to neurological impact."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that conditions like gestational hypertension and significant postpartum hemorrhage can impact the hormonal cascade necessary for milk production, potentially leading to delayed onset of copious milk (lactogenesis II) or suboptimal milk supply. This information is critical for anticipating potential challenges and providing targeted support."

            "question": "An infant, 5 days old, was born at 7 lbs 8 oz. Today, the infant weighs 7 lbs 0 oz and has had 3 wet diapers and 1 meconium-like stool in the last 24 hours. Based on typical infant output and weight patterns, what is the most appropriate initial assessment?",
            "options": [
                "This output and weight loss are within normal limits for a 5-day-old, suggesting adequate milk transfer.",
                "The infant's weight loss of approximately 7.4% is concerning, and output (especially wet diapers) is lower than expected for day 5.",
                "The infant's weight loss is acceptable, but the stool output (meconium-like) is problematic for this age.",
                "Both weight and output are excellent indicators of sufficient milk transfer, requiring no further action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By day 5, a breastfed infant typically should have at least 6+ wet diapers and 3-4 yellow, seedy stools in 24 hours. A weight loss of 7.4% is approaching the upper limit of normal (often cited as 7-10%), but combined with significantly low output, it strongly suggests insufficient milk intake. Meconium-like stool at day 5 is also atypical; stools should be transitioning to yellow by day 3-4."

            "question": "A new mother from a culture where formula feeding is often perceived as a sign of modernity and convenience expresses a goal of exclusively breastfeeding for 'about three months, if possible.' What is the coach's primary role in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Strongly encourage her to breastfeed for the full WHO-recommended 6 months, citing health benefits.",
                "Educate her extensively on the long-term benefits of exclusive breastfeeding to persuade her to change her goal.",
                "Acknowledge and respect her stated goal, explore her understanding of it, and collaboratively develop a plan that supports her within her cultural context.",
                "Refer her immediately to a lactation consultant, as her goal is not aligned with optimal breastfeeding duration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Defining maternal goals and understanding cultural expectations are cornerstones of client-centered care. The coach's role is to support the client's self-identified goals, explore the reasoning behind them, and provide information in a non-judgmental way, rather than imposing external standards or trying to change their mind. This builds trust and empowers the client."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing significant pain with every latch, describing it as a 'pinching' or 'biting' sensation. Upon observation, the infant's lips are often tucked in, and there's an audible clicking sound during feeds. This constellation of symptoms most strongly suggests which physiological barrier?",
            "options": [
                "Severe breast engorgement, causing nipple flattening.",
                "A fungal infection (thrush) in the infant's mouth or mother's nipples.",
                "Suboptimal latch mechanics, often related to shallow latch or oral restrictions.",
                "Insufficient glandular tissue (IGT), leading to low milk supply."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pinching pain, tucked lips, and clicking sounds are classic indicators of a shallow or ineffective latch. These issues prevent the infant from achieving a deep gape and proper suction, often leading to nipple trauma for the mother and inefficient milk transfer for the infant. While other issues can cause pain, these specific symptoms point directly to latch mechanics."

            "question": "What is the primary purpose of maintaining clear, concise, and objective professional documentation of client interactions, assessments, and care plans?",
            "options": [
                "To provide detailed evidence exclusively for insurance claims and billing purposes.",
                "To protect the coach from potential liability in case of client complaints or adverse outcomes.",
                "To ensure continuity of care, track client progress over time, facilitate effective communication with other healthcare providers, and support reflective practice.",
                "To serve as a personal diary of client experiences, allowing the coach to remember specific details for future reference."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional documentation serves multiple critical purposes: it ensures that all involved in the client's care have access to accurate, up-to-date information, enabling seamless transitions and consistent support. It also allows the coach to monitor progress, evaluate interventions, and aids in professional accountability and growth. While liability protection and insurance are secondary benefits, they are not the primary purpose."

            "question": "After conducting a thorough intake, reviewing maternal clinical history, infant health screening data, and clarifying client goals, a coach identifies several potential barriers. What is the next critical step in the 'Synthesizing Data' phase of the L.A.T.C.H. method?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately present a pre-formulated breastfeeding plan based on common issues.",
                "Prioritize the identified barriers with the client and collaboratively develop initial strategies and a support plan.",
                "Refer the client to a medical doctor without further discussion, as barriers indicate a medical problem.",
                "Focus solely on the most urgent physiological barrier, temporarily ignoring emotional or cultural aspects."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesizing data involves more than just identifying problems; it's about integrating all gathered information to form a holistic understanding. The next critical step is to engage the client in prioritizing these barriers and co-creating a realistic, actionable support plan. This collaborative approach ensures the plan is client-centered and sustainable."

            "question": "During an intake, a client expresses significant anxiety about breastfeeding, stating, 'I feel like a failure every time she cries at the breast, and it brings back feelings from my past that I can't quite place.' Applying principles of trauma-informed care, what is the most appropriate response?",
            "options": [
                "Reassure her immediately that 'all mothers struggle' and redirect to practical latch tips.",
                "Document her statement and suggest she seek therapy for her past issues before continuing breastfeeding support.",
                "Acknowledge her feelings, validate her experience by saying, 'It sounds incredibly difficult to feel that way,' and ask, 'How can I best support you right now, given these feelings?'",
                "Explain that breastfeeding is often challenging and that her feelings are a normal part of the process, then move on."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A trauma-informed approach prioritizes psychological safety, trustworthiness, and empowerment. Acknowledging and validating the client's feelings without judgment, and then asking how *they* wish to proceed, gives them control and reinforces their autonomy, which is crucial for individuals who may have experienced a loss of control in past traumatic events. This approach fosters trust and allows the client to guide the pace of support."

            "question": "A healthy, full-term infant is 3 days old. The mother reports 2-3 wet diapers and 2 transitional (greenish-brown) stools in the past 24 hours. Given typical infant feeding progression and output milestones, which statement best characterizes this infant's feeding status?",
            "options": [
                "Output is within the normal range for a 3-day-old, suggesting adequate milk transfer.",
                "The wet diaper count is slightly low, but the stool count is appropriate for this age.",
                "Both wet diaper and stool counts are lower than expected for a 3-day-old, indicating potential insufficient milk intake.",
                "The presence of transitional stools is a positive sign, regardless of the wet diaper count."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By day 3, a healthy, full-term breastfed infant should typically have 3-4 wet diapers and 3-4 stools, which should be transitioning from meconium towards yellow. The reported 2-3 wet diapers and 2 stools are on the lower side of expected output, suggesting that the infant may not be receiving sufficient milk. This warrants closer monitoring and potentially an assessment of milk transfer efficiency."
