            "options": [
                "Immediately recommending a specific nipple shield product based on general guidelines.",
                "Documenting only the physical symptoms reported by the client, such as pain intensity.",
                "Employing active listening to understand their full feeding history, emotional state, support system, and specific, SMART feeding goals.",
                "Advising them to exclusively pump to rest the nipples for 24 hours without further assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Listen & Learn' pillar emphasizes comprehensive intake. Active listening and understanding the client's full context, emotional state, and specific goals are crucial for building rapport and creating an individualized, effective support plan, as opposed to jumping to solutions."

            "question": "When assessing a deep latch during the 'Assess & Align' pillar, what is a key visual indicator that suggests effective milk transfer and comfort for the dyad?",
            "options": [
                "The infant's lips are inverted, creating a tight seal on the nipple.",
                "The infant's mouth is wide open, covering a significant portion of the areola, with both lips flanged outwards.",
                "The infant's cheeks are visibly dimpling inwards with each suck, indicating strong suction.",
                "The mother reports sharp, stinging pain throughout the feeding, particularly at the beginning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A deep latch is characterized by a wide gape, with the infant taking in a large amount of breast tissue beyond the nipple, and lips flanged outwards. Inverted lips, dimpling cheeks, and maternal pain are all indicators of a less effective or painful latch."

            "question": "A 3-week-old infant is presenting with poor weight gain (less than 10th percentile for age), frequent feeds, and the parent reports audible clicking sounds during nursing and persistent nipple pain. What physiological barrier should the coach primarily consider and recommend a professional evaluation for?",
            "options": [
                "Maternal hyperlactation leading to an imbalance of foremilk/hindmilk.",
                "Infant reflux, indicated by spitting up after feeds.",
                "Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) or other oral restrictions, which can impair effective milk transfer and cause compensatory clicking.",
                "Maternal mastitis, which typically presents with fever, body aches, and a painful, red breast area."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Poor weight gain, frequent feeding attempts, clicking sounds, and maternal nipple pain are classic signs often associated with oral restrictions such as tongue-tie, which prevent the infant from achieving an effective latch and milk transfer. Referral to a qualified medical professional for assessment is crucial."

            "question": "During the 'Comfort & Connection' phase, a coach observes a mother struggling with milk let-down, often expressing feelings of anxiety and tension during feeds. Based on the psychophysiology of the milk ejection reflex, what intervention would be most directly supportive?",
            "options": [
                "Recommending a strict 3-hour feeding schedule to regulate milk supply and reduce anxiety.",
                "Emphasizing relaxation techniques, skin-to-skin contact, and creating a calm, private feeding environment to promote oxytocin release.",
                "Suggesting a galactagogue supplement immediately, prior to exploring other interventions.",
                "Focusing solely on adjusting the infant's latch position, irrespective of the mother's emotional state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Comfort & Connection' pillar highlights the crucial role of oxytocin in the milk ejection reflex (let-down). Stress and anxiety can inhibit oxytocin release. Promoting relaxation, skin-to-skin contact, and a calm environment directly supports oxytocin production and, consequently, efficient let-down."

            "question": "A client, after successfully establishing breastfeeding, is returning to work. To support 'Holistic Habits' for sustainable long-term success, what advice should the coach provide regarding milk expression and maintenance of supply?",
            "options": [
                "Advise them to pump only when engorged to avoid oversupply and potential discomfort.",
                "Recommend establishing a regular pumping schedule that mimics the baby's feeding pattern while separated, along with proper milk storage guidelines.",
                "Suggest introducing formula during work hours to simplify the process and reduce stress.",
                "Tell them to stop breastfeeding entirely and switch to exclusive pumping as it is more convenient for working parents."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For sustainable long-term success, especially when returning to work, maintaining milk supply is critical. A regular pumping schedule that aligns with the baby's usual feeding times helps signal the body to continue producing milk, while proper storage ensures the milk is safe for consumption. This reflects the 'Holistic Habits' pillar's focus on practical, sustainable strategies."

            "question": "A coach is working with a dyad where the infant has a diagnosed mild tongue-tie, the mother reports low milk supply concerns, and expresses significant fatigue due to frequent night wakings. When developing an integrative support plan using the L.A.T.C.H. framework, which approach best demonstrates comprehensive case conceptualization?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing solely on encouraging the mother to get the tongue-tie revised, ignoring other contributing factors.",
                "Addressing only the mother's fatigue as the primary issue, without exploring its connection to feeding challenges.",
                "Developing a multi-faceted plan that includes referral for tongue-tie evaluation, optimizing latch for milk transfer, exploring strategies for parental rest and sleep, and assessing feeding frequency/duration to address supply concerns.",
                "Recommending immediate supplementation with formula for all feeds to address low supply and fatigue without further assessment or intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrative case conceptualization requires synthesizing information from all L.A.T.C.H. pillars. A comprehensive plan addresses the interplay of physiological barriers (tongue-tie), milk transfer mechanics (latch), supply issues, and maternal well-being (fatigue), rather than isolating a single symptom or cause."

            "question": "A client asks their L.A.T.C.H. coach if a specific herbal supplement will increase their milk supply, stating they saw it advertised online. What is the most appropriate and ethical response within the coach's scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend the supplement if it has many positive reviews online, as anecdotal evidence is often reliable.",
                "Advise against all herbal supplements as they are unregulated and potentially harmful.",
                "Explain that as a Breastfeeding Support Coach, you cannot prescribe or recommend specific supplements, and advise them to discuss this with their healthcare provider.",
                "Provide a list of commonly used galactagogues and let the client choose which one they prefer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Professional Scope & Ethics' pillar clearly defines that Breastfeeding Support Coaches do not diagnose, prescribe, or recommend medical treatments or supplements. The ethical response is to maintain professional boundaries and advise the client to consult with their healthcare provider for medical advice regarding supplements."

            "question": "A client mentions during the 'Listen & Learn' intake that their previous lactation consultant dismissed their concerns about nipple pain, stating 'some discomfort is normal.' How should a L.A.T.C.H. coach approach this information during the intake and subsequent case conceptualization?",
            "options": [
                "Validate the client's past experience, acknowledge their feelings, and ensure their current concerns about pain are thoroughly heard and taken seriously, establishing trust.",
                "Dismiss the client's previous experience as irrelevant to the current consultation, focusing strictly on the present symptoms.",
                "Immediately contradict the previous consultant's advice without further assessment, stating that all pain is abnormal.",
                "Focus only on the physical aspects of the current pain, ignoring the emotional impact or distrust caused by past experiences."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Building trust and rapport is fundamental to the 'Listen & Learn' pillar. Validating a client's past negative experiences and ensuring their current concerns are heard and taken seriously is crucial for establishing a safe and effective coaching relationship, which is a key ethical consideration."

            "question": "A client reports sharp, shooting pain in their breast during and after feeds, accompanied by visible nipple blanching (white tip). Upon assessment, the coach observes a shallow, compressed latch. What is the most likely immediate cause of the pain, and which L.A.T.C.H. pillar's strategies would be prioritized?",
            "options": [
                "Mastitis, requiring medical intervention; Pillar C (Comfort & Connection) for pain management.",
                "Thrush (yeast infection); Pillar H (Holistic Habits) for hygiene protocols.",
                "Poor latch mechanics leading to nipple trauma and vasospasm; Pillar A (Assess & Align) for optimizing positioning and latch.",
                "Low milk supply, causing the infant to suck harder; Pillar L (Listen & Learn) to reassess feeding goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sharp, shooting pain and nipple blanching, especially in conjunction with a shallow, compressed latch, are classic indicators of nipple trauma and vasospasm (restricted blood flow) caused by poor latch mechanics. The priority intervention falls under 'Assess & Align' to correct the latch and improve comfort and milk transfer."
