            "question": "Which anatomical characteristic is most indicative of a truly deep and effective latch, ensuring optimal milk transfer and preventing nipple trauma?",
            "options": [
                "The baby's upper lip is flanged outward.",
                "The nipple appears compressed into a 'lipstick' shape upon release.",
                "A wide gape with the majority of the areola included in the baby's mouth.",
                "The baby's cheeks dimple inward during sucking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A wide gape, encompassing a significant portion of the areola, allows the baby to effectively compress the milk sinuses behind the nipple, leading to efficient milk transfer and protecting the nipple from damage. Nipple compression or dimpling often indicate a shallow latch."

            "question": "A new mother expresses concern about her 3-day-old infant's milk intake. Which metric, when combined with other observations, provides the most objective initial assessment of adequate milk transfer?",
            "options": [
                "The baby appears sleepy after feeds.",
                "Mother reports feeling a tingling sensation during let-down.",
                "The infant has 3-4 wet diapers and 2-3 mustard-yellow stools in 24 hours.",
                "Baby feeds for 10 minutes per side at each feeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While other options can be positive signs, quantifiable wet and dirty diaper counts, particularly the transition to mustard-yellow stools by day 3-5, are the most objective and reliable early indicators of adequate milk intake in the newborn period."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A 2-week-old infant consistently struggles to maintain a deep latch, often slides off the breast, and the mother reports significant nipple pain and clicking sounds during feeding. Upon assessment, the infant's tongue appears restricted in elevation and extension. This cluster of symptoms is most suggestive of what physiological barrier?",
            "options": [
                "Infant hypotonia (low muscle tone).",
                "Congenital muscular torticollis.",
                "Posterior ankyloglossia (tongue tie).",
                "A high-arched palate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The inability to maintain a deep latch, sliding off the breast, nipple pain, and clicking sounds, coupled with restricted tongue movement (especially elevation and extension), are classic indicators of a tongue tie, which impairs the tongue's ability to cup the breast and create effective suction."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A mother with persistent oversupply is experiencing frequent engorgement, plugged ducts, and her baby is often gassy and sputters at the breast due to a forceful let-down. What is the most appropriate initial management strategy a coach would recommend?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive pumping after every feed to empty the breasts completely.",
                "Introducing formula top-ups to reduce breast fullness and baby's intake.",
                "Implementing block feeding for several consecutive feeding sessions.",
                "Increasing galactagogue intake to stabilize milk production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Block feeding helps regulate oversupply by signaling the breasts to produce less milk on one side over a block of time. This reduces engorgement, the force of the let-down, and the discomfort for both mother and baby. Aggressive pumping or galactagogues would exacerbate oversupply."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "For a mother who has recently had a C-section and is experiencing abdominal discomfort, which breastfeeding position would typically be recommended to minimize pressure on her incision site while still promoting good latch?",
            "options": [
                "The traditional cradle hold.",
                "The football (clutch) hold.",
                "The laid-back (biological nurturing) position.",
                "The cross-cradle hold."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The football hold allows the baby's body to be tucked under the mother's arm, keeping pressure off the abdomen and incision site. This makes it an ideal and comfortable position for mothers recovering from a C-section."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "A breastfeeding parent presents with sudden onset of flu-like symptoms, a red, painful, wedge-shaped area on her breast, and a fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C). What is the immediate priority in managing this suspected mastitis?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop breastfeeding from the affected breast to prevent bacterial spread.",
                "Apply ice packs continuously to reduce inflammation.",
                "Encourage frequent and effective milk removal from the affected breast.",
                "Prescribe a course of antibiotics without further assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The immediate priority for mastitis management is frequent and effective milk removal from the affected breast to clear any blockage and reduce inflammation. Stopping breastfeeding can worsen engorgement and infection. While antibiotics may be indicated, milk removal is paramount and often the first line of defense."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Which hormone plays a crucial role in strengthening maternal-infant bonding, facilitating the milk ejection reflex, and fostering feelings of connection and well-being, particularly during skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding?",
            "options": [
                "Prolactin",
                "Estrogen",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Dopamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, often referred to as the 'love hormone,' is central to maternal-infant bonding, the milk ejection reflex, and feelings of connection. Its release is significantly stimulated by skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A lactating parent is experiencing significant fatigue and reports feeling overwhelmed. Beyond direct breastfeeding support, what holistic habit is crucial for sustainable lactation and overall maternal well-being?",
            "options": [
                "Restricting fluid intake to avoid over-hydration.",
                "Prioritizing complex carbohydrates and adequate protein intake.",
                "Engaging in high-intensity exercise daily to boost energy.",
                "Limiting social interactions to conserve energy and reduce stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adequate nutrition, specifically prioritizing complex carbohydrates for sustained energy and sufficient protein for tissue repair and milk production, is vital for combating fatigue and supporting the high energy demands of lactation. The other options are generally not recommended or can be detrimental."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A mother consistently experiences painful, creased nipples after breastfeeding, despite trying various positions. The baby is gaining weight slowly, and feeds are lengthy (often 45+ minutes). What is the most likely underlying issue contributing to these combined symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Severe breast engorgement.",
                "A shallow latch often due to an oral restriction.",
                "Raynaud's phenomenon (vasospasm).",
                "A suspected milk allergy in the infant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Painful, creased nipples are classic signs of a shallow latch, where the nipple is not deeply enough in the baby's mouth. Slow weight gain and lengthy feeds indicate inefficient milk transfer. An oral restriction, such as a tongue tie, is a common cause of a shallow latch, leading to this constellation of symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "A 6-week-old exclusively breastfed infant has only gained 120 grams in the last week, which is significantly below the expected range of 150-200g/week. The mother reports the baby seems generally content but rarely has audible swallows after the initial let-down. What is the most critical next step for the breastfeeding coach?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the mother to switch to formula immediately to prevent further weight loss.",
                "Recommend increasing the baby's feeding frequency to every 1.5 hours without further assessment.",
                "Conduct a weighted feed to objectively assess milk transfer and advise on targeted strategies to increase supply and improve transfer.",
                "Reassure the mother that weight gain often slows down significantly after 6 weeks and to continue as usual."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Below-expected weight gain is a serious concern. A weighted feed provides objective data on actual milk transfer efficiency. Based on this, the coach can then implement targeted strategies to increase supply (e.g., more frequent feeds, pumping, galactagogues) and improve transfer, ensuring the infant receives adequate nutrition. Switching to formula without assessment is premature, and simply increasing frequency without addressing transfer issues may not be sufficient."
