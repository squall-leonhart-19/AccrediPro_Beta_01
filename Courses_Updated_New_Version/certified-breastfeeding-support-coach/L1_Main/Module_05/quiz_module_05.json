            "question": "A lactating parent is concerned about their energy levels and milk supply. What is the recommended approximate additional daily caloric intake for a breastfeeding parent in the first six months postpartum, assuming adequate pre-pregnancy weight?",
            "options": ["100-200 kcal", "330-500 kcal", "700-800 kcal", "1000-1200 kcal"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The recommended additional caloric intake for lactating parents is typically 330-500 kcal per day to support milk production while maintaining maternal energy stores, as per guidelines from organizations like the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) safe sleep guidelines, what is the safest sleep environment for an infant during the first year of life?",
            "options": ["In a crib or bassinet in a separate room", "Co-sleeping in the same bed as parents", "In a crib or bassinet in the parents' room", "On an infant sleep positioner in a crib"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AAP recommends room-sharing (infant sleeps in parents' room but on a separate, safe sleep surface like a crib or bassinet) for at least the first six months, and ideally the first year, to reduce the risk of SIDS."

            "question": "A client reports difficulty with their let-down reflex, experiencing delayed milk flow and infant frustration at the breast. As a coach, you understand that stress can inhibit oxytocin release. Which physiological mechanism primarily explains this inhibition?",
            "options": ["Increased prolactin secretion", "Sympathetic nervous system activation", "Enhanced mammary gland sensitivity", "Reduced pituitary gland function"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). These catecholamines can constrict the smooth muscle cells surrounding the alveoli and inhibit oxytocin release, thereby impeding the let-down reflex."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "A new parent reports experiencing significant neck and shoulder pain while breastfeeding. Which ergonomic adjustment should a Breastfeeding Support Coach prioritize recommending to alleviate this discomfort?",
            "options": ["Switching to a strict feeding schedule", "Using a firm pillow to bring the baby to breast height", "Feeding in a dimly lit room", "Extending feeding sessions to promote deeper latch"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proper ergonomics are crucial. Bringing the baby up to the breast with pillows, rather than bending over the baby, helps maintain a neutral spine and neck position for the parent, significantly reducing strain on the neck and shoulders."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "When designing sustainable daily routines for a new breastfeeding parent, which principle is most important for long-term adherence and well-being?",
            "options": ["Strict adherence to a rigid schedule to establish predictability", "Prioritizing all household chores before personal rest", "Incorporating flexibility and self-care alongside infant needs", "Minimizing external support to foster independence"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable routines are flexible and adaptable, allowing for the unpredictable nature of infant care while also prioritizing maternal self-care, rest, and well-being to prevent burnout."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "A client expresses feeling overwhelmed and isolated. As their coach, what is the most effective initial step in helping them build a robust support ecosystem?",
            "options": ["Immediately connecting them with a peer support group", "Advising them to delegate all household tasks to their partner", "Guiding them to identify their specific needs and how different types of support can meet them", "Suggesting they limit visitors to reduce stress"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first step in building effective support is understanding what the parent truly needs (e.g., emotional, practical, informational) so that appropriate resources and individuals can be identified and engaged."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "A breastfeeding parent asks about consuming alcohol. What is the most accurate guidance regarding alcohol consumption and breastfeeding?",
            "options": ["\"Pump and dump\" is always necessary after any alcohol intake", "Alcohol passes into breast milk at levels similar to maternal blood alcohol", "A small amount of alcohol is safe immediately before feeding", "Alcohol consumption has no impact on infant sleep patterns"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alcohol freely passes into breast milk, reaching peak concentrations around 30-60 minutes after consumption (or longer if consumed with food). The milk alcohol level is similar to the maternal blood alcohol level. \"Pump and dump\" does not significantly speed up the elimination of alcohol from milk; time is the primary factor."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "A client is preparing to return to work at 12 weeks postpartum and wishes to continue exclusively breastfeeding. What is a key strategy to help maintain their milk supply while separated from their infant?",
            "options": ["Increasing fluid intake significantly on working days only", "Pumping at least every 2-3 hours during work hours", "Substituting formula for one feeding per day", "Introducing solids to the infant immediately upon returning to work"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regular milk removal is essential for maintaining milk supply. Pumping at intervals that mimic the baby's feeding schedule (typically every 2-3 hours) during work hours helps signal the body to continue producing milk."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Which essential fatty acid is crucial for infant brain and eye development and is primarily transferred to the infant via breast milk, making maternal dietary intake important?",
            "options": ["Linoleic Acid (LA)", "Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA)", "Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)", "Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DHA is a long-chain omega-3 fatty acid vital for the development of the infant's brain, retina, and nervous system. Maternal dietary intake of DHA directly influences its concentration in breast milk."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Chronic maternal sleep deprivation during lactation can negatively impact milk supply due to its effect on which key hormone responsible for milk production?",
            "options": ["Estrogen", "Progesterone", "Prolactin", "Oxytocin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prolactin, the primary hormone responsible for milk production, is secreted in a pulsatile manner, with higher levels often observed during sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can disrupt this pattern and potentially lead to lower prolactin levels, thereby impacting milk supply. While oxytocin is crucial for let-down, prolactin is directly linked to milk synthesis."
