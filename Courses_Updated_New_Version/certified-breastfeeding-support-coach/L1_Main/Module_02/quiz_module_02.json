            "question": "Which of the following infant anatomical features is most crucial for achieving a deep, effective latch and optimal milk transfer?",
            "options": [
                "A high-arched hard palate",
                "A short frenulum",
                "A mobile, protusible tongue",
                "Strong cheek muscles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A mobile, protusible tongue is essential for the infant to cup the breast, create suction, and perform the wave-like motion necessary for milk expression from the milk sinuses. While other features can impact latch, the tongue's function is paramount for deep latch mechanics."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A new mother complains of significant upper back and neck pain during breastfeeding sessions. What is the most likely ergonomic factor contributing to her discomfort?",
            "options": [
                "Using a breastfeeding pillow that is too soft",
                "Leaning forward to bring her breast to the baby",
                "Not switching positions frequently enough",
                "Her baby is not latching deeply enough"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leaning forward to bring the breast to the baby is a common cause of maternal back and neck strain. Optimal maternal ergonomics emphasize bringing the baby to the breast, maintaining an upright, supported posture."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "What is the primary characteristic of an optimal asymmetrical latch?",
            "options": [
                "The infant's mouth covers an equal amount of areola above and below the nipple.",
                "The infant's nose is touching the breast, and the chin is tucked.",
                "More of the areola is taken into the infant's mouth below the nipple than above.",
                "The infant's lips are inverted, creating a tight seal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An optimal asymmetrical latch involves the infant taking in more breast tissue below the nipple, allowing the nipple to point towards the roof of the mouth. This positioning facilitates proper tongue function and prevents nipple compression."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "When visually assessing for pre-latch indicators, a coach observes a newborn displaying rooting reflexes, widely opening their mouth, and bringing their hands to their mouth. What does this indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The baby is likely overstimulated and needs to calm down before feeding.",
                "The baby is showing early signs of hunger and readiness to latch.",
                "The baby is experiencing discomfort or pain.",
                "The baby has just completed a feed and is signaling satiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These are classic early hunger cues. Recognizing these allows the mother to offer the breast before the baby becomes overly distressed, which can make latching more challenging."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST reliable indicator of effective milk transfer during a breastfeeding session?",
            "options": [
                "The baby's active sucking pattern for 5 minutes.",
                "Audible, rhythmic swallows from the infant.",
                "The mother's perception of her breasts feeling full.",
                "The baby's hands consistently fisting during the feed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Audible, rhythmic swallows (often described as 'ka-gulps') are a direct and reliable sign that the infant is actively ingesting milk. While other factors contribute, swallowing confirms transfer."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A mother reports significant nipple pain and shows a coach her nipple immediately after a feed. The nipple appears flattened and 'lipstick shaped.' This is a classic sign of:",
            "options": [
                "A deep, effective latch.",
                "Engorgement.",
                "A shallow latch with nipple compression.",
                "A milk bleb."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flattened, creased, or 'lipstick shaped' nipple indicates that the nipple has been compressed against the hard palate or gums due to a shallow latch, rather than being elongated and rounded, which is typical of a deep, effective latch."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "For a mother recovering from a C-section who needs to minimize pressure on her abdominal incision, which breastfeeding position is often recommended?",
            "options": [
                "Cradle hold",
                "Cross-cradle hold",
                "Football (clutch) hold",
                "Dancer hold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The football (clutch) hold allows the baby's body to be positioned away from the mother's abdomen, reducing pressure on a C-section incision. The side-lying position is another good option for similar reasons."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When utilizing external supports like breastfeeding pillows, what is their primary purpose in achieving optimal maternal and infant alignment?",
            "options": [
                "To encourage the baby to sleep longer during feeds.",
                "To raise the baby to the correct height at the breast, reducing maternal strain.",
                "To provide a soft, comfortable surface for the baby to lie on.",
                "To prevent the baby from kicking during feeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breastfeeding pillows primarily serve to elevate the baby to breast height, allowing the mother to maintain good posture and bring the baby to the breast without hunching or straining her back and shoulders."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "The infant's tongue plays a critical role in breastfeeding mechanics. What is its primary function during an effective latch for milk extraction?",
            "options": [
                "To create a vacuum that pulls the nipple into the mouth.",
                "To cup the breast and perform a wave-like motion to compress milk sinuses.",
                "To stimulate the let-down reflex by touching the nipple tip.",
                "To prevent the infant from swallowing air by sealing the lips."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The tongue's primary function in milk extraction is to cup the breast and perform a coordinated wave-like motion, compressing the milk sinuses behind the nipple and creating negative pressure to draw milk out. The vacuum is part of the overall process but the tongue's action on the breast tissue is key."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A breastfeeding mother calls you, distressed, reporting that her 3-day-old baby is consistently making clicking sounds and her nipples are becoming very sore after feeds. What is your immediate primary recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Advise her to switch to formula for a few feeds to give her nipples a rest.",
                "Suggest applying a lanolin cream to her nipples after each feed.",
                "Guide her on how to gently break the latch and re-latch the baby, focusing on a wide mouth.",
                "Recommend using a nipple shield to protect her sore nipples."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clicking sounds and nipple soreness are strong indicators of a shallow or ineffective latch. The immediate priority is to correct the latch mechanics to prevent further damage, improve comfort, and ensure effective milk transfer. Breaking the latch and re-latching with a focus on a wide mouth and proper positioning addresses the root cause."
