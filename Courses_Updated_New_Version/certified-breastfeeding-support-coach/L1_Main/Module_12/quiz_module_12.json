            "question": "During a clinical intake, a client expresses a desire to breastfeed exclusively for 'as long as possible.' Applying SMART goal principles, which refinement would be most effective for goal setting?",
            "options": ["Aim for 3 months, then re-evaluate.", "Breastfeed without supplementing for 6 months.", "Continue breastfeeding until the baby self-weans.", "Focus on daily successful feeds, reassess weekly."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A SMART goal needs to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. 'Breastfeed without supplementing for 6 months' provides a clear, measurable timeframe, aligning with these principles and common breastfeeding recommendations."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A key indicator of a deep and effective latch during an assessment would be:",
            "options": ["Audible clicking sounds", "Only the nipple visible after latch", "Flanged lips covering a significant portion of the areola", "Baby's cheeks dimpling inwards"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A deep and effective latch is characterized by flanged lips (like a 'fish mouth') covering a substantial portion of the areola, allowing the baby to draw breast tissue deep into their mouth for efficient milk transfer and comfortable feeding."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A client reports persistent nipple pain and blanching after feeds. The most immediate troubleshooting intervention a coach might suggest, after observing the latch, is:",
            "options": ["Suggest a different pump flange size", "Recommend a nipple shield", "Guide adjustments to positioning and latch technique", "Advise immediate cessation of breastfeeding"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nipple pain and blanching are common signs of a shallow or improper latch. The primary intervention involves assessing and guiding adjustments to the baby's positioning and latch technique to ensure a deeper, more comfortable attachment and prevent further nipple trauma."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Which hormone is primarily responsible for the milk ejection reflex (let-down), and what can significantly inhibit its release?",
            "options": ["Prolactin; physical activity", "Oxytocin; stress and anxiety", "Estrogen; warm environments", "Dopamine; skin-to-skin contact"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is the crucial hormone for the milk ejection reflex. Its release is highly sensitive to maternal psychological states, with stress, anxiety, and pain being significant inhibitors that can impede let-down."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "General guidelines suggest an increase of approximately 300-500 calories per day for lactating individuals to meet the increased energy demands of milk production, without compromising maternal nutrient stores."

            "options": ["Offer personal advice based on your own experiences", "Suggest specific marriage counseling services", "Listen empathetically but gently redirect the conversation back to breastfeeding", "Document the marital issues in detail for future reference"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While empathy is important, a breastfeeding coach's scope of practice is specific to lactation support. It is professional to listen empathetically but then gently guide the conversation back to the client's breastfeeding goals and offer resources for non-breastfeeding related issues if appropriate, without providing direct advice outside one's expertise."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "During an assessment, you observe a newborn struggling to maintain a deep latch, consistently sliding off the breast, and exhibiting poor weight gain. After ruling out common positioning issues, what might be a primary concern requiring further evaluation?",
            "options": ["Maternal diet deficiencies", "Insufficient maternal milk storage capacity", "Oral motor dysfunction or tongue-tie", "Overactive maternal let-down reflex"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent difficulty with latch maintenance, sliding off the breast, and poor weight gain are strong clinical indicators that the infant may have an oral motor dysfunction, such as a tongue-tie, which impairs their ability to effectively transfer milk."

            "explanation": "Certified Breastfeeding Support Coaches operate within their defined scope of practice, which does not include providing medical advice or prescribing supplements. The ethical response is to inform the client of this boundary and advise them to consult with a qualified healthcare provider regarding medical treatments or supplements."
