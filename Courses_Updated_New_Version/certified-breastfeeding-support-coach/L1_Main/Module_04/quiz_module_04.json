            "question": "Which hormone is primarily responsible for triggering the milk ejection reflex (let-down) by causing myoepithelial cells around the alveoli to contract?",
            "options": [
                "Prolactin",
                "Estrogen",
                "Oxytocin",

                "It encourages the infant to feed on a strict schedule.",
                "It utilizes gravity to help the baby latch more effectively and access innate feeding reflexes.",
                "It solely relies on the mother's active positioning of the baby.",
                "It reduces the need for skin-to-skin contact."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological Nurturing leverages gravity and the infant's natural reflexes, allowing the baby to self-attach and promoting more intuitive, effective feeding."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stress hormones like norepinephrine and epinephrine cause vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow to the breast and hindering oxytocin's ability to reach and act on the myoepithelial cells, thus impairing let-down."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "How does the 'laid-back' position, characteristic of Biological Nurturing, specifically contribute to better maternal ergonomic health compared to traditional upright nursing positions?",
            "options": [
                "It forces the mother to actively hold the baby's head, strengthening arm muscles.",
                "It encourages the mother to recline, allowing gravity to support the baby's weight and reducing strain on the mother's back, neck, and arms.",
                "It requires fewer pillows and support props, simplifying setup.",
                "It promotes a more rigid, controlled posture for the mother."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The laid-back position allows the mother to recline comfortably, letting gravity hold the baby against her body, thereby significantly reducing strain on her back, neck, shoulders, and arms compared to upright positions where she might be actively holding or supporting the baby's full weight."
