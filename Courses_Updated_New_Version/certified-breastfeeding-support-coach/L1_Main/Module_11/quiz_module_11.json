            "question": "When assessing the biomechanics of a latch, which observation is most indicative of effective milk transfer and minimal nipple trauma?",
            "options": [
                "The infant's lips are slightly tucked inward, creating a tight seal.",
                "The infant's chin is touching the breast, but the nose is slightly away, with a wide, asymmetrical gape.",
                "Audible clicking sounds are consistently heard throughout the feed.",
                "The mother reports significant pain at the beginning of every feed that subsides after a few minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An effective, deep latch is characterized by a wide, asymmetrical gape where the infant takes in more of the areola below the nipple, the chin is tucked into the breast, and the nose is free. This positioning allows for optimal milk transfer and reduces nipple trauma, unlike tucked lips, clicking, or persistent pain."

            "question": "In the context of the psychoneuroendocrinology of lactation, how does maternal stress primarily impact milk ejection (let-down)?",
            "options": [
                "It directly inhibits prolactin production, leading to reduced milk synthesis.",
                "It can release catecholamines that constrict myoepithelial cells, hindering oxytocin's action.",
                "It causes a significant increase in milk fat content, making milk harder to express.",
                "It enhances the infant's suck reflex, leading to overfeeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maternal stress can activate the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of stress hormones like adrenaline (catecholamines). These hormones can constrict the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli in the breast, interfering with the action of oxytocin and thereby inhibiting the milk ejection reflex (let-down)."

            "question": "A client expresses concern about her infant's slow weight gain and frequent, prolonged feeding sessions, coupled with her own persistent nipple pain. During an advanced observation, the coach notes a heart-shaped appearance of the infant's tongue tip when crying and difficulty lifting the tongue to the palate. These findings are highly suggestive of:",
            "options": [
                "A milk protein allergy in the infant.",
                "Maternal low milk supply.",
                "An infant oral restriction, such as ankyloglossia (tongue-tie).",
                "A normal variation in infant feeding behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of slow weight gain, frequent feeds, maternal nipple pain, a heart-shaped tongue, and restricted tongue mobility are classic signs associated with ankyloglossia (tongue-tie). This condition can significantly impair an infant's ability to latch deeply and effectively transfer milk."

            "options": [
                "Providing a generic feeding schedule for all clients.",
                "Ensuring the plan is solely developed by the coach without client input.",
                "Setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals collaboratively with the client.",
                "Focusing exclusively on medical interventions rather than holistic support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collaboratively setting SMART goals with the client is a cornerstone of effective care planning. This approach empowers the client, ensures the goals are personalized and realistic, and significantly increases the likelihood of adherence and successful outcomes, aligning with AccrediPro's client-centered methodology."

            "question": "According to AccrediPro's guidelines for Holistic Habits, which macronutrient is particularly important for lactating parents due to its role in milk production and maternal recovery, and should comprise approximately 15-20% of daily caloric intake?",
            "options": [
                "Fats",
                "Carbohydrates",
                "Proteins",
                "Sugars"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proteins are crucial for tissue repair, immune function, and milk protein synthesis, making them vital for lactating parents. While all macronutrients are important, protein intake recommendations for lactating individuals typically increase to support these physiological demands, often targeting 15-20% of daily calories."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A common challenge in troubleshooting nipple pain is differentiating between a shallow latch and candidiasis (thrush). Which symptom is *most* specific to candidiasis and less likely to be solely caused by a shallow latch?",
            "options": [
                "Nipple pain that is worse at the beginning of a feed.",
                "Infant displaying white patches in the mouth that cannot be wiped away.",
                "Nipple blanching after a feed.",
                "Creased or flattened nipple shape after a feed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While nipple pain can be present in both, white patches in the infant's mouth that cannot be wiped away (often on the tongue, gums, or buccal mucosa) are a hallmark sign of oral candidiasis (thrush). Nipple blanching, creasing, and pain at the start of a feed are more commonly associated with mechanical issues like a shallow latch."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "When considering the Comfort & Connection aspect of the L.A.T.C.H. method, which practice is most directly supported by evidence regarding its positive impact on both maternal-infant bonding and the physiological processes of lactation, particularly oxytocin release?",
            "options": [
                "Maintaining a strict feeding schedule to promote infant independence.",
                "Encouraging daily use of a pacifier to soothe the infant.",
                "Promoting frequent, uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant.",
                "Limiting direct eye contact during feeds to prevent overstimulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequent, uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is profoundly beneficial. It stabilizes infant vital signs, reduces stress for both mother and infant, and significantly promotes the release of oxytocin in the mother, which is essential for milk ejection and maternal-infant bonding. This aligns with the psychoneuroendocrinology of lactation."
