            "question": "A client presents with sudden onset nipple pain, blanching, and severe throbbing pain after feeds, despite a seemingly good latch. What is the MOST appropriate initial step in the diagnostic framework, according to AccrediPro's guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend topical antifungal treatment immediately.",
                "Advise increasing feeding frequency to ensure breast emptying.",
                "Conduct a thorough maternal history, feeding observation, and assess for vasospasm and other potential causes.",
                "Suggest a frenotomy assessment for the infant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AccrediPro Diagnostic Framework emphasizes a systematic and holistic approach. While the symptoms suggest vasospasm, jumping to a conclusion or treatment without a comprehensive assessment (maternal history, feeding observation, detailed symptom analysis) is premature. Options A and D are specific interventions without full diagnosis, and B is not directly addressing the pain symptom."

            "question": "A mother with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is struggling with milk production for her 3-week-old. Her infant has slow weight gain despite frequent feeds and appears generally content at the breast for short periods. This scenario is most indicative of which type of low milk supply?",
            "options": [
                "Secondary low milk supply due to inadequate breast emptying.",
                "Primary low milk supply, potentially hormonally mediated.",
                "Low milk supply caused by an overactive let-down reflex.",
                "Transient low milk supply due to maternal fatigue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PCOS is a hormonal condition often associated with primary low milk supply, which originates from insufficient glandular development or hormonal imbalances impacting lactation capacity. While inadequate emptying can contribute, the underlying PCOS points to a primary issue. Other options do not fit the clinical picture as well."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A 2-week-old infant frequently chokes, gags, and pulls off the breast during feeds, often making a clicking sound. The mother also reports feeling engorged before feeds and observes her infant swallowing very rapidly. Which intervention is most likely to alleviate these symptoms of overactive let-down?",
            "options": [
                "Implementing block feeding for several days.",
                "Suggesting a laid-back feeding position.",
                "Recommending a nipple shield to slow milk flow.",
                "Advising the mother to pump for 15 minutes before each feed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A laid-back feeding position utilizes gravity to reduce the force of the let-down, making it easier for the infant to manage the rapid flow. While pumping before feeds (D) can help, it may also increase overall supply. Block feeding (A) is typically for oversupply, not just OALD, and nipple shields (C) are a tool for latch issues, not primarily OALD, and can sometimes worsen flow if not correctly used."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a localized, tender, red, and warm area on her breast, accompanied by a fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C) and body aches. She reports feeling generally unwell and fatigued. What is the MOST likely diagnosis and initial management recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Plugged duct; advise warm compresses and massage.",
                "Mastitis; advise frequent emptying, pain relief, and immediate medical consultation for antibiotic consideration.",
                "Breast abscess; immediate referral for surgical drainage.",
                "Galactocele; reassure and monitor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The presence of systemic symptoms such as fever and body aches, in addition to localized inflammation, differentiates mastitis from a simple plugged duct. While frequent emptying and pain relief are crucial, immediate medical consultation for antibiotic consideration is vital to prevent progression to a breast abscess, which requires more invasive treatment."

            "question": "During an infant feeding assessment, you observe a 4-week-old infant with a shallow latch, clicking sounds, and poor weight gain. Upon visual inspection, the infant's tongue has restricted elevation and lateralization, and the frenulum appears short and thick, extending close to the tip of the tongue. This presentation is highly suggestive of:",
            "options": [
                "A posterior tongue tie.",
                "An anterior Class I or II ankyloglossia.",
                "A lip tie requiring frenotomy.",
                "Infant oral thrush."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restricted elevation and lateralization of the tongue, coupled with a short, thick frenulum extending to or near the tip, are classic signs of an anterior tongue tie (ankyloglossia), often classified as Class I or II. Posterior ties are less visible but still restrict function. Lip ties and thrush would present differently."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A breastfeeding parent reports intense burning and shooting pain in her nipples after feeds, often accompanied by blanching (whitening) and then redness or blueness of the nipple. She describes the pain as similar to her fingers during cold weather. This symptom complex is highly indicative of:",
            "options": [
                "Nipple thrush.",
                "Bacterial infection.",
                "Vasospasm (Raynaud's phenomenon of the nipple).",
                "Poor latch mechanics leading to nipple trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The description of blanching, subsequent color changes (redness/blueness), burning, shooting pain, and sensitivity to cold is classic for vasospasm, often linked to Raynaud's phenomenon. While poor latch can cause pain, it typically doesn't involve the specific color changes, and thrush or bacterial infections have different pain characteristics."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A previously well-nursing 6-month-old infant suddenly refuses to latch at the breast, crying and pushing away when offered. The mother reports no recent changes in her diet or routine, and the infant is not showing signs of illness. What is a common, often overlooked, cause for a sudden nursing strike in an infant of this age?",
            "options": [
                "Insufficient milk supply.",
                "Teething discomfort.",
                "Maternal strong let-down.",
                "Nipple confusion from pacifier use."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Teething discomfort is a very common cause of sudden breast refusal (nursing strike) in older infants, as the sucking action can exacerbate pain in sore gums. While other options can cause refusal, teething is a frequent, age-appropriate cause when other factors are ruled out."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "For a preterm infant struggling to maintain an effective latch and transfer milk due to oral motor immaturity and a disorganized suck, which tool is generally recommended as a temporary measure to facilitate breastfeeding while supporting oral development?",
            "options": [
                "A Supplemental Nursing System (SNS).",
                "An oversized nipple shield.",
                "A standard nipple shield.",
                "Exclusive cup feeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A standard nipple shield can help preterm infants achieve a deeper latch and organize their suck, swallow, breathe pattern, facilitating milk transfer and providing positive oral stimulation. An SNS (A) is primarily for low supply, and oversized shields (B) are generally not appropriate. Exclusive cup feeding (D) is an alternative feeding method but does not facilitate direct breastfeeding."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client has been diagnosed with primary low milk supply due to insufficient glandular tissue (IGT). She is committed to breastfeeding and wishes to provide as much breast milk as possible while ensuring her infant receives adequate nutrition. Beyond optimizing direct milk removal from the breast, what is a key tool that can support her breastfeeding goals by allowing the infant to receive supplemental milk at the breast?",
            "options": [
                "Exclusive use of a nipple shield.",
                "Implementation of block feeding.",
                "A Supplemental Nursing System (SNS).",
                "Replacing breastfeeds with formula bottles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) is ideal in this scenario. It allows the infant to receive supplementary milk (expressed breast milk or formula) at the breast, which stimulates milk supply through suckling while ensuring adequate intake and maintaining the breastfeeding relationship. Nipple shields (A) are for latch issues, block feeding (B) for oversupply, and formula bottles (D) bypass the breast."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) published in 2023 highlighted that inadequate breast emptying is a significant contributor to secondary low milk supply, accounting for approximately 45% of cases. Given this, what is a primary intervention strategy for a coach to recommend when assessing a client with suspected secondary low milk supply?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately recommend a prescription galactagogue.",
                "Focus on optimizing latch, feeding frequency, and effective milk removal.",
                "Suggest exclusive pumping to measure milk output precisely.",
                "Advise weaning to formula to ensure infant nutrition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given that inadequate breast emptying is a major cause of secondary low milk supply, the primary intervention should focus on optimizing the mechanics of milk removal. This includes ensuring a good latch, frequent and effective feeding, and potentially power pumping if needed. Galactagogues (A) are often considered after optimizing milk removal, and weaning (D) is not a first-line intervention. Exclusive pumping (C) can be useful but isn't the sole primary intervention."
