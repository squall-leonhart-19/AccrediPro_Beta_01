            "question": "When conducting advanced maternal history mapping (L2: Listen & Learn), which category of information is most crucial for uncovering potential underlying breastfeeding challenges beyond the immediate postpartum period?",
            "options": [
                "Only focusing on the infant's weight gain trends since birth.",
                "Gathering detailed information on previous births, feeding experiences (both successes and challenges), and any relevant pre-existing maternal medical conditions or surgeries.",
                "Limiting questions strictly to the current day's feeding frequency and duration.",
                "Prioritizing the partner's feeding history and preferences over the birthing parent's."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced maternal history mapping requires a deep dive into the birthing parent's complete medical, obstetric, and feeding history to identify patterns, predisposing factors, or contributing issues that might impact current breastfeeding success. This holistic perspective is key to effective problem-solving."

            "question": "Which hormone is primarily responsible for the milk ejection reflex (let-down) and is significantly influenced by maternal comfort, emotional connection, and psychological state (L5: Comfort & Connection)?",
            "options": [
                "Prolactin, which stimulates milk production.",
                "Estrogen, which plays a role in breast development.",
                "Oxytocin, often called the 'love hormone,' which contracts myoepithelial cells.",
                "Progesterone, which maintains pregnancy and inhibits lactation initially."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is the key hormone for the milk ejection reflex. It causes the myoepithelial cells around the alveoli to contract, pushing milk down the ducts. Its release is highly sensitive to maternal emotions, stress, comfort, and the infant's presence, highlighting the neurobiological link between comfort and successful let-down."

Based on L8: Scope of Practice and Ethical Support Standards, what is the most appropriate action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Provide counseling and recommend specific antidepressant medications.",
                "Advise the client to 'tough it out' as these feelings are a normal, temporary part of early motherhood.",
                "Acknowledge her feelings with empathy, provide emotional support within the coach's scope, and strongly recommend referral to a qualified mental health professional.",
                "Instruct her to stop breastfeeding immediately as it can exacerbate depression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A breastfeeding support coach's scope of practice does not include diagnosing or treating mental health conditions. The ethical and appropriate response is to listen empathetically, validate the client's experience, and facilitate a referral to a licensed mental health professional who can provide the necessary medical and therapeutic intervention. Coaches provide support, not medical treatment."

            "question": "A recent meta-analysis of breastfeeding interventions (n=15,000+) found that early, uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact within the first hour postpartum significantly increased successful breastfeeding initiation by approximately 22%. This finding primarily supports which aspect of the L.A.T.C.H. framework?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Troubleshoot & Target' phase, by identifying specific feeding issues.",
                "The 'Comfort & Connection' phase, by promoting neurobiological bonding, oxytocin release, and instinctive feeding behaviors.",
                "The 'Holistic Habits' phase, by establishing sustainable feeding routines.",
                "The 'Assess & Align' phase, by evaluating anatomical factors of the dyad."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early skin-to-skin contact is a powerful facilitator of the 'Comfort & Connection' phase. It promotes maternal-infant bonding, stabilizes infant vital signs, triggers the infant's innate feeding reflexes, and stimulates maternal oxytocin release, all of which are crucial for successful let-down and breastfeeding initiation."

            "question": "Client Maya, 3 weeks postpartum, reports her infant frequently 'falls asleep' at the breast within minutes, leading to concerns about poor weight gain. She has tried various positions without success. Based on the comprehensive L.A.T.C.H. framework, which initial approach would be most appropriate and comprehensive for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Advise immediate supplementation with formula to ensure adequate intake.",
                "Focus exclusively on stimulating the infant to stay awake during feeds using external methods.",
                "Initiate the 'Listen & Learn' phase to gather a detailed history, then proceed to 'Assess & Align' to observe a full feed, evaluate infant oral motor function, and assess maternal milk transfer and breast anatomy.",
                "Recommend a strict feeding schedule every two hours, regardless of infant cues, to ensure consistent intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive approach following the L.A.T.C.H. framework would start with 'Listen & Learn' to understand the full context of Maya's situation. This is then followed by 'Assess & Align,' which involves observing a full feed to identify specific issues with latch, suck, milk transfer, and any anatomical considerations for both parent and infant before targeting specific interventions."
