            "question": "A client with twins expresses concern about maintaining an adequate milk supply for both infants. What is the most crucial recommendation for establishing and maintaining sufficient milk production in the early postpartum period for multiples?",
            "options": [
                "Supplementing with formula after every breastfeed to ensure satiety.",
                "Feeding each baby separately for efficiency, focusing on one at a time.",
                "Frequent and effective milk removal, ideally tandem feeding or pumping after feeds.",
                "Limiting feeding sessions to 10 minutes per breast to conserve maternal energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequent and effective milk removal is paramount to build and maintain supply, especially with the higher demand of multiples. Tandem feeding or pumping after feeds ensures maximal breast stimulation and milk output."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client with confirmed Insufficient Glandular Tissue (IGT) is committed to providing as much breast milk as possible. Beyond frequent nursing and pumping, what adjunctive strategy is often considered to maximize milk production in such cases?",
            "options": [
                "Limiting infant's time at the breast to prevent nipple confusion.",
                "Exclusive use of galactagogues without other interventions.",
                "Implementing a triple-feeding routine (nurse, pump, supplement) and potentially using galactagogues under medical supervision.",
                "Switching to a strict formula-only regimen to reduce stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For IGT, a multi-modal approach is often needed. Triple feeding maximizes breast stimulation and ensures infant intake, while galactagogues can sometimes provide a modest boost in supply when used appropriately and under medical guidance as part of a comprehensive plan."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "In induced lactation for a non-gestational parent, what is a realistic expectation regarding the typical milk volume produced compared to a biological mother who has carried a pregnancy to term?",
            "options": [
                "Milk volume is usually equivalent to that of a gestational parent.",
                "Milk volume is typically significantly lower, often requiring supplementation.",
                "Milk volume is always higher due to pharmacological induction.",
                "Milk volume is unpredictable and rarely sufficient for any feeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While induced lactation can be successful, the milk volume produced is typically lower than that of a biological mother who has carried a pregnancy. Full milk supply is rare, and most parents require supplementation to meet the infant's full nutritional needs."
