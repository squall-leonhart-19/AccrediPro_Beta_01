            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A new mother contacts you 36 hours postpartum, reporting her infant is lethargic, has not latched effectively since birth, and has only produced one wet diaper in the last 12 hours. Which of the following is the most immediate priority for triage?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting a nipple shield for easier latch",
                "Scheduling a routine follow-up in 24 hours",

                "Recommending immediate medical evaluation for dehydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lethargy, poor feeding, and significantly reduced wet diapers in the first 48 hours are critical red flags indicating potential dehydration and requiring urgent medical intervention."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "A client presents with significant nipple pain and trauma, describing it as 'sharp, stinging pain' during and after feeds. Based on evidence-based intervention selection, which initial action is most critical for addressing the root cause?",

                "\"You must pump for 15 minutes after every feed; there's no other way.\"",
                "\"Many mothers struggle with supply; let's discuss a realistic plan that fits your lifestyle and what feels manageable.\"",
                "\"If you don't increase your supply, your baby will need formula, which we want to avoid.\"",
                "\"Just try to breastfeed more often, it usually works for everyone.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This response uses reflective listening, normalizes the struggle, and invites collaboration to create a SMART goal that is client-centered and achievable, aligning with MI principles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Premature infants often require a gradual progression from non-nutritive sucking to full oral feeds, developing coordination and endurance. Direct breastfeeding may not be feasible initially, and skin-to-skin is highly beneficial."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "The 'H' in the LATCH assessment tool, often expanded to include 'Help' or 'Support,' is crucial for the sustainable maintenance of breastfeeding. Which aspect does this primarily address for the mother?",

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A client expresses concern about her 3-week-old baby's slow weight gain. Objective assessment confirms suboptimal milk transfer due to a shallow latch. After discussing the benefits of increased feeding frequency and specific latch adjustments, the client states, 'I understand, but I'm just so tired; I don't know if I can do all that.' How should the coach respond using Motivational Interviewing principles?",
            "options": [
                "\"You need to prioritize your baby's weight gain; you can rest later when things are easier.\"",

                "\"If you don't increase feeds, we'll have to consider formula supplementation to ensure adequate weight gain.\"",
                "\"I'll just tell you exactly what to do; don't worry about figuring it out yourself.\""

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dynamic monitoring involves continuous evaluation of the plan's effectiveness, client adherence, and infant response. Adjustments are made iteratively to ensure the plan remains appropriate and effective for the evolving needs of the dyad."
