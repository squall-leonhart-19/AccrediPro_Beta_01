            "question": "A client reports experiencing sharp, shooting pain in her breast and a fever of 101°F. She asks her Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach if she has mastitis and what antibiotic she should request from her doctor. What is the most appropriate ethical response from the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnose mastitis and recommend a specific antibiotic based on common protocols.",
                "Advise the client that diagnosing medical conditions and prescribing medication is outside the coach's scope of practice, and recommend she contact her healthcare provider immediately for diagnosis and treatment.",
                "Suggest some natural remedies for mastitis while also recommending she see her doctor if symptoms worsen.",
                "Tell her it sounds like mastitis and she should just rest and keep breastfeeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnosing medical conditions and recommending specific medications are strictly outside the scope of practice for a breastfeeding support coach. The ethical duty is to refer to a qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment."

            "question": "During an initial consultation, a client expresses hesitation about a suggested feeding plan due to personal discomfort with certain techniques. According to the principles of informed consent and maternal autonomy, what is the coach's primary responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Persuade the client that the suggested plan is evidence-based and will lead to the best outcomes.",
                "Document the client's refusal and proceed with a modified plan without further discussion.",
                "Fully explain the rationale behind the plan, discuss alternative approaches, respect the client's decision, and ensure she feels empowered in her choices.",
                "Terminate the coaching relationship if the client is unwilling to follow the recommended plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires providing comprehensive information, discussing alternatives, and respecting the client's autonomous decision-making, even if it differs from the coach's initial recommendation. Empowerment is key."

                "Ensuring the platform allows for easy sharing of client data with other professionals for collaborative care.",
                "Using a platform that offers free services, even if security features are basic.",
                "Verifying the platform is HIPAA-compliant (for US clients) or adheres to GDPR (for EU clients) and has robust encryption and access controls to protect sensitive health information.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protecting client privacy and data is paramount. Coaches must use secure, compliant platforms that meet relevant data protection regulations like HIPAA or GDPR to safeguard sensitive health information."

            "question": "A prominent infant formula company offers to sponsor a Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach's upcoming workshop, providing branded educational materials and a financial stipend. Adhering to the principles of the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, what is the most ethical course of action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the sponsorship, as it provides valuable resources and helps defray costs, ensuring to disclose the sponsorship to attendees.",
                "Accept the sponsorship but remove all branded logos and materials from the workshop.",
                "Decline the sponsorship to avoid any real or perceived conflict of interest and maintain impartiality in promoting breastfeeding.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The WHO Code aims to protect breastfeeding by regulating the marketing of breast-milk substitutes. Accepting sponsorship from formula companies creates a conflict of interest, undermining the coach's role in promoting unbiased breastfeeding support."

            "question": "A client from a different cultural background expresses a strong preference for exclusive pumping, citing family traditions and community norms. The coach's personal experience and training heavily emphasize direct breastfeeding. How should the coach ethically proceed?",
            "options": [
                "Gently educate the client on the proven benefits of direct breastfeeding and encourage her to reconsider her preference.",
                "Refer the client to another coach who specializes in exclusive pumping, as this falls outside the current coach's primary comfort zone.",
                "Acknowledge and respect the client's cultural context and preferences, provide evidence-based support for her chosen feeding method, and adapt coaching strategies accordingly.",
                "Express concern that the client's cultural practices might negatively impact her baby's health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A client's baby, who is 3 weeks old, has only gained 2 ounces in the last week, and the client reports consistently wet diapers but infrequent stools. The Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach observes a shallow latch. What is the most ethical and appropriate next step for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Provide extensive latch correction techniques and schedule a follow-up for next week.",
                "Reassure the client that weight gain can be variable and to continue monitoring.",

                "Suggest introducing formula top-ups without further professional assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Significant low weight gain in an infant warrants immediate medical evaluation by a healthcare provider (pediatrician) to rule out underlying issues, or an IBCLC for a more advanced lactation assessment, as this is beyond a coach's scope. Ethical practice dictates prompt referral when concerns arise that require higher-level expertise."

            "question": "A Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach is creating an advertisement for their services. Which of the following statements would be considered unethical or misleading?",
            "options": [
                "\"Providing evidence-based breastfeeding support for new parents.\"",
                "\"Guaranteed to increase your milk supply by 50% in 24 hours!\"",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing requires honesty and avoiding exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims. Guaranteeing specific, rapid physiological outcomes like a 50% increase in milk supply in 24 hours is unrealistic, misleading, and unethical."

            "question": "After a successful coaching series, a client sends a Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach a friend request on a personal social media platform. What is the most ethical approach for the coach to maintain professional boundaries?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the friend request to show appreciation for the client's success and build a stronger personal connection.",
                "Accept the friend request but immediately restrict the client's access to personal posts.",
                "Politely decline the request, explaining that professional boundaries require maintaining separate professional and personal online presences, potentially suggesting a professional page instead.",
                "Ignore the request and hope the client forgets about it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining clear professional boundaries is crucial for the integrity of the coaching relationship. Dual relationships, such as being personal friends with clients on social media, can compromise objectivity and confidentiality. Declining politely while explaining the rationale is the most ethical approach."

                "Continue working, as clients are relying on them, and hope the stress will pass.",
                "Prioritize personal well-being by taking a temporary break, seeking supervision or personal support, and ensuring client care is not compromised by their impaired state.",
                "Only take on easy cases to avoid further stress, while still maintaining a full client load.",
                "Discuss personal problems with clients to gain sympathy and understanding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice includes the responsibility for self-care. Impaired judgment or performance due to burnout can negatively impact client care. Taking steps to address personal well-being, including breaks or seeking support, is an ethical imperative to ensure continued competent service."

            "question": "A new immigrant client, whose primary language is not English, is struggling with breastfeeding and appears distressed. She mentions her community traditionally uses specific herbal remedies for milk supply, which are not evidence-based and could potentially be harmful. The coach does not speak the client's language. What is the most ethical and effective approach?",
            "options": [
                "Insist on using only evidence-based methods and advise against all traditional remedies, despite the language barrier.",
                "Provide a list of recommended English-speaking IBCLCs and pediatricians, assuming the client can navigate the referral process.",
                "Utilize a professional medical interpreter to facilitate communication, explore the client's cultural practices with respect, provide evidence-based information, and facilitate a referral to an IBCLC or healthcare provider who can address both the lactation challenges and potential risks of traditional remedies.",
                "Focus solely on demonstrating latch techniques non-verbally, avoiding discussion of cultural practices or referrals due to the language barrier."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario combines cultural humility, scope of practice, and ethical referrals. Using a professional interpreter ensures informed consent and effective communication. Respecting cultural practices while prioritizing safety and referring to appropriate professionals (IBCLC for lactation, healthcare provider for potential harm of remedies) demonstrates comprehensive ethical care."
