            "question": "A 3-day-old exclusively breastfed infant presents with significant lethargy, poor muscle tone, and only 3 wet diapers in 24 hours. Which of the following is the most immediate red flag requiring urgent medical referral, as outlined in Lesson L1?",
            "options": [
                "Infrequent stools (less than 3 per day)",
                "Mild jaundice visible only on the face",
                "Significant lethargy, poor muscle tone, and inadequate wet diapers",
                "Maternal nipple soreness without visible damage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Significant lethargy, poor muscle tone, and inadequate urine output (less than 6 wet diapers in 24 hours for a 3-day-old) are critical red flags indicating potential dehydration and insufficient milk intake, requiring immediate medical evaluation. While other options might warrant attention, they are not emergency red flags."

            "options": [
                "Large, pendulous breasts with prominent stretch marks",
                "Asymmetrical breasts with one significantly larger than the other due to previous surgery",
                "Widely spaced breasts with a tubular shape, minimal breast changes during pregnancy, and little to no engorgement postpartum",
                "Firm, engorged breasts after birth that soften with feeding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IGT is characterized by insufficient development of milk-producing glandular tissue. Common physical signs include widely spaced breasts, a tubular shape, and a notable lack of breast changes or growth during pregnancy and postpartum, often leading to primary supply failure."

            "question": "An infant with a cleft palate is struggling with breastfeeding due to an inability to create adequate suction and seal. According to Lesson L4, which intervention is most appropriate for supporting their feeding needs while working towards direct breastfeeding?",
            "options": [
                "Exclusive use of a standard bottle nipple, as direct breastfeeding is typically impossible",
                "Feeding only expressed breast milk via a spoon to avoid oral challenges",
                "Utilizing specialized feeding systems (e.g., Haberman feeder, Dr. Brown's Specialty Feeder) with paced feeding techniques to manage milk flow and support intake",
                "Recommending formula exclusively, as breast milk cannot be effectively delivered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Infants with cleft palates often cannot create the necessary suction for direct breastfeeding. Specialized feeding systems are designed to deliver milk effectively without requiring strong suction, allowing the infant to receive breast milk while minimizing air intake and supporting their growth."

            "options": [
                "Limiting breast stimulation to once daily to prevent oversupply and discomfort",
                "Immediate introduction of prescription galactagogues without concurrent breast stimulation",
                "Frequent, effective breast stimulation through pumping and/or nursing every 2-3 hours, combined with ample skin-to-skin contact",
                "Relying solely on herbal supplements without any mechanical stimulation to rebuild milk supply"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The cornerstone of relactation is frequent and effective breast stimulation to signal the body to resume milk production. This typically involves pumping or nursing at least 8-12 times in 24 hours, often complemented by skin-to-skin contact and potentially galactagogues."

            "question": "A 2-month-old exclusively breastfed infant is identified as Failure to Thrive (FTT) due to consistently falling below the 3rd percentile for weight and showing poor feeding cues. What is a critical initial step in the lactation consultant's assessment protocol for FTT, as detailed in Lesson L7?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately recommending formula supplementation without further assessment to prevent further weight loss",
                "Conducting comprehensive weighted feeds to accurately quantify milk transfer, assessing feeding dynamics, and reviewing a detailed feeding history",
                "Advising the mother to increase her water intake to improve milk volume",
                "Suggesting the immediate introduction of pureed solids to increase caloric intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For an FTT infant, a thorough assessment is crucial to determine the root cause. Weighted feeds provide objective data on milk transfer, while a detailed feeding history and observation of feeding dynamics can identify issues with latch, positioning, or feeding frequency. Supplementation may be necessary but should follow a comprehensive assessment."

            "question": "During an emotionally charged home visit for a crisis breastfeeding situation, the client begins sharing deeply personal non-breastfeeding related marital problems. As per Lesson L8 on professional boundaries, how should the breastfeeding support coach ethically respond?",
            "options": [
                "Offer personal advice and emotional support for the marital issues, as the client is in distress",
                "Gently redirect the conversation back to breastfeeding concerns, reiterate the scope of practice, and offer referrals for appropriate marital counseling if needed",
                "Immediately terminate the consultation due to the client's inappropriate disclosure",
                "Listen passively without comment for the entire visit, as it's important to build rapport"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining professional boundaries is critical. While empathy is important, a breastfeeding coach's scope of practice is limited to lactation support. Ethically, the coach should gently steer the conversation back to the relevant issues and provide referrals for services outside their expertise."

            "options": [
                "Induced lactation always requires prescription medication, while relactation can never use it",
                "Induced lactation involves establishing a milk supply without a prior pregnancy or birth, whereas relactation involves re-establishing a milk supply after a previous period of lactation",
                "Relactation is typically a faster and easier process than induced lactation due to existing glandular tissue",
                "Only induced lactation protocols typically utilize a Supplemental Nursing System (SNS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Induced lactation is the process of stimulating milk production in an individual who has not recently been pregnant or given birth, often for an adopted baby. Relactation is the process of re-establishing milk production after it has previously ceased, typically for a biological child."
