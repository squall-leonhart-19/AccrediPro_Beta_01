            "id": "q29_1",
            "question": "A 4-week-old presents with poor weight gain, frequent fussiness at the breast, and clicking sounds. Mother reports adequate milk supply based on pumping volume. Physical assessment reveals a strong suck reflex but shallow latch and mild torticollis. Based on advanced clinical reasoning, what is the MOST appropriate initial step for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend immediate formula supplementation and refer to a pediatrician for Failure to Thrive (FTT).",
                "Focus solely on optimizing latch technique and positioning, assuming it's the primary issue.",
                "Conduct a comprehensive oral assessment, including palpation and range of motion, and assess for cranial nerve involvement, considering interdisciplinary referral.",
                "Advise the mother to pump exclusively to ensure the baby receives enough milk, bypassing direct breastfeeding for now."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced clinical reasoning necessitates looking beyond superficial symptoms to potential underlying structural or neurological factors (like torticollis and oral motor dysfunction) that impact feeding. A comprehensive oral assessment and considering interdisciplinary referral addresses the multi-systemic nature of the problem, aligning with L1 and L3."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "Which specific anatomical structure's limited range of motion is most directly implicated in an infant's inability to achieve an optimal deep latch, often leading to nipple compression and pain, despite otherwise good positioning?",
            "options": [
                "The mobility of the mandibular symphysis.",
                "The elasticity of the maxillary labial frenum.",
                "The posterior attachment and elasticity of the lingual frenum.",
                "The excursion of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A restrictive posterior lingual frenum (tongue tie) significantly limits the tongue's ability to elevate, cup the breast, and create the necessary suction and compression for a deep, effective latch, as discussed in L2."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "A 6-week-old exclusively breastfed infant exhibits persistent arching during feeds, frequent spitting up (often projectile), poor sleep, and a faint, eczema-like rash on the cheeks. The mother reports a personal history of severe seasonal allergies. Which multi-systemic barrier is MOST likely contributing to this presentation?",
            "options": [
                "Insufficient milk supply leading to hunger and fussiness.",
                "An overactive let-down reflex causing rapid milk flow and discomfort.",
                "Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) exacerbated by a potential food protein intolerance/allergy.",
                "Maternal anxiety impacting the infant's feeding behavior through stress hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of arching, projectile spitting up, rash, and maternal allergy history strongly suggests a multi-systemic issue involving the gastrointestinal and immune systems, indicative of GERD and a potential food protein intolerance, as covered in L3."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "During skin-to-skin contact, the release of oxytocin in both mother and infant plays a crucial role in promoting breastfeeding success. Beyond stimulating milk ejection, what is another significant neurobiological effect of oxytocin relevant to the breastfeeding dyad, as explored in L4?",
            "options": [
                "Increased cortisol production, enhancing maternal and infant alertness.",
                "Inhibition of dopamine pathways, reducing the infant's drive to feed.",
                "Enhancement of vagal tone, promoting parasympathetic calming, stress reduction, and bonding.",
                "Stimulation of ghrelin, specifically increasing appetite in the infant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is a key neurohormone for bonding and stress reduction. Its role in enhancing vagal tone promotes the parasympathetic 'rest and digest' state, crucial for both maternal relaxation and infant regulation, directly supporting comfort and connection in the dyad."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "A client expresses strong motivation to exclusively breastfeed but struggles with consistent latching attempts due to overwhelming exhaustion and pervasive self-doubt. According to the COM-B model of behavior change (L5), which aspect should the coach prioritize addressing first to build holistic habit architecture?",
            "options": [
                "Opportunity: Suggesting she find more quiet, private feeding spaces to reduce distractions.",
                "Motivation: Reinforcing her desire to breastfeed and providing positive affirmations.",
                "Capability: Demonstrating various latching positions and techniques, and building her confidence through guided practice.",
                "Environment: Recommending her partner take on more household chores and infant care tasks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While motivation is present, exhaustion and self-doubt directly impair psychological and physical capability. The COM-B model emphasizes that capability (both psychological and physical) is often the most critical initial factor to address when a motivated individual struggles with performing a behavior. Building confidence and skills directly empowers the client."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "A Certified Breastfeeding Support Coach identifies an infant with significant oral motor dysfunction and suspected ankyloglossia, impacting feeding efficiency and maternal comfort. The mother expresses hesitation regarding surgical intervention (frenotomy). What is the MOST ethical and clinically sound approach for the coach, as per L6 on interdisciplinary collaboration?",
            "options": [
                "Strongly advocate for a frenotomy, emphasizing its benefits based on the coach's past client successes.",
                "Refer the dyad to a pediatric dentist or ENT for a comprehensive evaluation, clearly documenting findings and the mother's concerns, while continuing to support current feeding goals.",
                "Recommend alternative therapies like craniosacral therapy as a first-line treatment without further medical evaluation.",
                "Advise the mother to wait and see if the issue resolves on its own, as frenotomies are often considered unnecessary by some."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most ethical and clinically sound approach involves operating within one's scope of practice, providing objective information, respecting client autonomy, and facilitating appropriate interdisciplinary referrals for medical diagnosis and treatment, while documenting all steps. This aligns with L6's emphasis on collaboration and documentation."

            "question": "A 3-week-old infant, exclusively breastfed, has dropped from the 50th percentile to the 5th percentile for weight-for-age according to WHO growth charts. The mother reports infrequent wet diapers and the infant seems lethargic. What is the IMMEDIATE priority in managing this failure to thrive (FTT) dyad, as discussed in L7?",
            "options": [
                "Schedule a follow-up visit in one week to re-assess weight gain, as changes can take time.",
                "Implement a comprehensive feeding plan including weighted feeds, assessment of milk transfer, and consideration of safe, temporary supplementation while investigating underlying causes.",
                "Focus solely on improving latch and positioning, assuming this will resolve the issue over several days.",
                "Advise the mother to increase her fluid intake to boost her milk production significantly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Failure to thrive, especially with lethargy and poor output, indicates an urgent need to ensure immediate caloric intake and hydration. While investigating underlying causes and improving latch are crucial, the immediate priority is stabilization through a comprehensive feeding plan that may include temporary supplementation, as detailed in L7 for FTT dyads."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "A new breastfeeding support professional seeks guidance from a Master Coach regarding a complex case involving a client with significant postpartum depression and feeding challenges. The Master Coach provides support, encourages reflective practice, and helps the mentee identify appropriate referral pathways without taking over the case. This scenario best exemplifies which core aspect of the Master Coach identity, as outlined in L8?",
            "options": [
                "Direct clinical intervention and problem-solving for the mentee's client.",
                "Advocacy for specific treatment modalities the mentee should use.",
                "Ethical leadership, mentorship, and fostering autonomous professional development.",
                "Passive observation of the mentee's struggles to encourage self-reliance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario perfectly illustrates ethical leadership and mentorship. The Master Coach empowers the mentee to develop their own skills and judgment, guides them in complex situations, and ensures appropriate client care through reflective practice and referral, rather than directly managing the mentee's case."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "A 2-month-old infant consistently refuses one breast, preferring the other, and is developing a mild positional plagiocephaly (flattened head) on the side opposite the preferred breast. The mother reports good milk supply from the preferred breast but engorgement on the refused side. This scenario most strongly suggests an underlying issue related to:",
            "options": [
                "Maternal breast anatomy variations causing a less comfortable feeding experience on one side.",
                "Infant feeding preference due to subtle taste differences in milk from each breast.",
                "Musculoskeletal asymmetry, such as torticollis, impacting head rotation and comfort at the breast.",
                "Insufficient milk ejection reflex on the refused side, making feeding frustrating for the infant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistent refusal of one breast coupled with positional plagiocephaly strongly points to a musculoskeletal issue like torticollis. The infant finds it uncomfortable or difficult to turn their head fully in one direction, leading to a preference for the easier side and pressure on the opposite side of the head, a common multi-systemic barrier discussed in L3."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "A client successfully breastfed her first child but is experiencing significant anxiety and difficulty with let-down with her second, despite clinical assessment indicating adequate milk supply. She feels overwhelmed and finds it hard to relax during feeds. From an integrated neurobiological (L4) and holistic habit architecture (L5) perspective, what is a key strategy to support this client?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend a strict feeding schedule to create predictability and reduce anxiety.",
                "Focus primarily on pharmacological interventions for anxiety, advising a medical consultation.",
                "Implement strategies to enhance parasympathetic activation (e.g., mindfulness, deep breathing, skin-to-skin) and build positive feeding rituals to re-establish a sense of safety and predictability.",
                "Advise her to pump and bottle-feed to reduce the direct breastfeeding pressure and perceived failure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This integrated approach directly addresses the client's challenges. Enhancing parasympathetic activation (neurobiology) helps counteract anxiety and facilitate let-down, while building positive feeding rituals (habit architecture) helps reframe the experience, reduce stress, and establish new, positive associations with breastfeeding for improved longevity and success."
