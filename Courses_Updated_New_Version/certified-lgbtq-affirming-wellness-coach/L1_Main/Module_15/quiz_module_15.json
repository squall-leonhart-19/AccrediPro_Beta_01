            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "When coaching a 'Neuro-Queer' client (Lesson 3), why is it important to prioritize 'sensory-safe' communication over traditional eye contact or body language cues?",

                "Because LGBTQ+ people are naturally more sensitive to light and sound",
