            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication breakdowns are a 'two-way street' caused by a mismatch in disposition and experience between neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals, rather than a deficit solely within the neurodivergent person."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
