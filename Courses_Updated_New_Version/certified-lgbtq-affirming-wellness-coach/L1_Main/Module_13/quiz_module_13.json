            "question": "According to Kimberlé Crenshaw’s framework of intersectionality discussed in Lesson 1, why is a 'single-axis' approach to wellness coaching insufficient?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses too heavily on biological factors rather than social ones.",
                "It fails to account for how overlapping identities create unique, non-additive experiences of discrimination.",
                "It assumes that all LGBTQ+ individuals share the exact same health goals.",
                "It prioritizes mental health over physical health in marginalized communities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality posits that marginalized identities (like race, gender, and class) do not simply 'add up' but interact to create distinct experiences of systemic advantage or disadvantage that cannot be understood by looking at one identity in isolation."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Neuroqueer' wellness (Lesson 2), what does the 'Double Empathy Problem' suggest about communication between a coach and a neurodivergent client?",
            "options": [
                "Neurodivergent clients lack the ability to empathize with neurotypical coaches.",
                "Coaches must have the same neurotype as the client to be effective.",
                "Communication breakdowns are a two-way mismatch in social expectations and processing styles, rather than a deficit in the client.",
                "Neurodivergent individuals possess 'twice' the empathy of neurotypical individuals, leading to emotional burnout."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem, proposed by Damian Milton, suggests that social difficulties arise because neurotypical and neurodivergent people have different ways of experiencing and communicating, meaning the 'empathy gap' exists on both sides."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 highlights that LGBTQ+ elders are significantly more likely than their cisgender/heterosexual peers to face which of the following challenges?",
            "options": [
                "A preference for institutionalized care over aging in place.",
                "Social isolation and a lack of 'informal' caregivers like adult children.",
                "Higher rates of financial literacy due to a lack of dependents.",
                "Resistance to using technology for wellness purposes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LGBTQ+ elders are twice as likely to live alone and much less likely to have children compared to their heterosexual peers, making them more reliant on professional services or 'chosen family' for care."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "The 'Sins Invalid' framework of Disability Justice (Lesson 4) emphasizes 'Interdependence.' How is this applied in a coaching setting?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to become entirely self-sufficient to avoid being a burden.",
                "Recognizing that everyone has needs and that community care is a valid and necessary wellness strategy.",
                "Focusing exclusively on the client's physical impairments.",
                "Requiring the client to bring a caregiver to every coaching session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interdependence challenges the 'independence' myth of capitalism, acknowledging that all people rely on others and that building supportive community networks is a core component of wellness."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Why is the dominance of 'bar culture' in LGBTQ+ spaces considered a significant barrier to wellness for those in recovery (Lesson 5)?",
            "options": [
                "Bars are generally too expensive for most community members.",
                "It creates a 'false choice' between maintaining sobriety and maintaining social connection within the community.",
                "LGBTQ+ individuals are biologically more prone to addiction than other groups.",
                "Most bars do not allow gender-neutral bathrooms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because many LGBTQ+ social hubs revolve around alcohol, individuals in recovery often feel they must choose between their sobriety and their community belonging, which can lead to isolation or relapse."

            "options": [
                "Chosen families are less stable than biological families and should be viewed as temporary.",
                "Chosen families often provide the essential safety and affirmation that biological families may withhold due to rejection.",
                "Coaches should always encourage clients to reconcile with biological family members for 'closure.'",
                "Chosen family is only relevant for younger LGBTQ+ individuals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For many LGBTQ+ people, chosen family is a survival strategy and a primary source of emotional and physical support, often carrying more weight and health-protective benefits than biological kinship."

                "It refers to a literal government tax on LGBTQ+ businesses.",
                "It describes the higher cost of gender-affirming healthcare, legal name changes, and specialized products that deplete financial resources.",
                "It is a discount given to LGBTQ+ individuals to offset lower wages.",
                "It refers to the cost of luxury items in 'gayborhoods.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Trans Tax' refers to the significant financial burden of gender-affirming care, legal fees, and safety-related expenses that many LGBTQ+ (especially trans) people must pay, contributing to wealth gaps."

            "options": [
                "The lack of LGBTQ+ representation in social media algorithms.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The digital divide is a major barrier in rural areas; without reliable internet, clients cannot access the specialized LGBTQ+ affirming care that is often unavailable locally."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A coach is working with a client who is both Black and Transgender. Applying the concepts from Lesson 1, the coach should recognize that:",
            "options": [
                "The client's race is their primary identity and should be addressed first.",
                "The client likely experiences 'compounding' minority stress that is distinct from the experience of a White Trans person or a Black Cis person.",
                "The coach should ignore identity and focus only on universal wellness habits like sleep and diet.",
                "The client's experiences of racism and transphobia are separate and do not overlap."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality teaches that the client's experience is shaped by the simultaneous interaction of race and gender identity, creating unique stressors and barriers that require a tailored, holistic approach."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Which coaching adaptation is most appropriate for a neurodivergent client who experiences sensory overload (Lesson 2)?",

                "Insisting on high-energy, 'motivational' speech to keep them engaged.",
                "Providing written summaries of sessions and allowing for 'camera-off' or low-sensory environments during calls.",
                "Requiring the client to maintain eye contact to prove they are listening.",
                "Avoiding all structure and letting the client talk without any goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Affirming neurodivergent coaching involves sensory-friendly adaptations, such as reducing visual/auditory input and providing multiple ways (written and verbal) to process information."
