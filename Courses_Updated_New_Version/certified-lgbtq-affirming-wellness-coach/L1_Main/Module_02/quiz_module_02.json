            "options": [
                "It acts as a distal stressor that leads to increased allostatic load and chronic cortisol elevation.",
                "It is a lifestyle choice that can be mitigated through simple dietary changes.",
                "It is only relevant if the client has a pre-existing mental health diagnosis.",
                "It primarily affects physical fitness levels rather than psychological well-being."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lack of recognition (misgendering, erasure) acts as a distal stressor—an external objective event—that contributes to the cumulative 'allostatic load' or wear and tear on the body."

            "question": "A client identifies as a non-binary person but chooses to wear a suit and tie for professional reasons. This distinction between their internal sense of self and their outward appearance is known as:",

                "Biological Sex vs. Assigned Gender"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gender identity is one's internal sense of self, while gender expression is the external manifestation (clothing, behavior, etc.) which may or may not align with traditional societal expectations."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, we explored the spectrum of attraction. How does 'Pansexuality' differ from 'Bisexuality' in a modern coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "Pansexuality only refers to attraction to cisgender individuals.",
                "Bisexuality is outdated and no longer used by the LGBTQ+ community.",
                "Pansexuality emphasizes attraction regardless of gender, whereas Bisexuality is often defined as attraction to more than one gender.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably by all practitioners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While definitions overlap, pansexuality typically emphasizes that gender is not a defining factor in attraction, while bisexuality is defined as attraction to more than one gender (not necessarily just two)."

                "Simply the sum of racism plus transphobia.",
                "A unique, synergistic experience of oppression that cannot be understood by looking at her identities in isolation.",
                "Less severe than the discrimination faced by white transgender men.",
                "Primarily related to her socioeconomic status rather than her identity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality teaches that overlapping identities create unique modes of discrimination and privilege that are greater than the sum of their parts."

                "Competency is a lifelong process, while Humility is a fixed end-goal.",
                "Competency focuses on memorizing facts about a group; Humility focuses on self-critique and the client as the expert of their own life.",
                "Humility is only for beginner coaches, while Competency is for master coaches.",
                "There is no difference; they are synonymous terms in the AccrediPro framework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility shifts the power dynamic, requiring the coach to engage in continuous self-reflection and recognize the client's 'lived expertise' rather than assuming 'mastery' over a culture."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 highlights 'Chosen Family.' Why is this concept critical for a wellness coach to understand when assessing a client's social support?",
            "options": [
                "Biological family is always the most important support system for health outcomes.",
                "Chosen family members often provide the 'social recognition' that mitigates the effects of biological family rejection.",
                "It allows the coach to ignore the client's legal next of kin in medical emergencies.",
                "Chosen family is only relevant for younger clients (Gen Z and Millennials)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For many LGBTQ+ individuals, chosen family provides the essential validation and safety that may be missing from biological structures, acting as a significant protective factor against minority stress."

                "A medical requirement for receiving gender-affirming surgery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gender euphoria is the positive psychological response to gender affirmation, often a more helpful metric in wellness coaching than focusing solely on 'dysphoria' or distress."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, why should 'Identity Recognition' be integrated into the client's Wellness Vision?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the coach gets higher satisfaction ratings.",
                "Because a vision that ignores a client's core identity is less likely to be intrinsically motivating or sustainable.",
                "Only because it is a legal requirement in most states.",
                "It should only be integrated if the client specifically asks for it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Wellness Vision must be authentic to the client's whole self. If the 'Future Self' in the vision doesn't reflect the client's true identity, the motivation to achieve it will be significantly diminished."

            "question": "A 2023 study cited in the module found that transgender youth who had their correct pronouns used by the people they lived with reported:",
            "options": [
                "No change in mental health outcomes.",
                "A 50% decrease in attempted suicide rates.",
                "Higher levels of physical activity but lower levels of self-esteem.",
                "A preference for biological family over chosen family."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (notably from The Trevor Project) consistently shows that social recognition, such as using correct pronouns, is directly linked to a significant reduction in suicide attempts among trans youth."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "If you accidentally use the wrong pronoun for a client during a session, what is the 'Affirming Coach' best practice?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore it and hope the client didn't notice to avoid making it awkward.",
                "Stop the session and spend 10 minutes apologizing and explaining how hard you are trying.",
                "Briefly correct yourself, apologize, and move on immediately to keep the focus on the client.",
                "Ask the client to explain why your mistake was hurtful so you can learn."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Quick Correction' method is best. Over-apologizing centers the coach's feelings and forces the client to comfort the coach, while ignoring it erodes trust. Correct, apologize, and continue."
