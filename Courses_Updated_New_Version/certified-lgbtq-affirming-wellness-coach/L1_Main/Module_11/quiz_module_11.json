            "question": "According to the neurobiology of minority stress (L1), how does chronic cortisol elevation specifically impact a client's relationship with their body?",
            "options": [
                "It increases metabolic rate, leading to rapid weight loss",
                "It creates a state of 'body hyper-vigilance' where the brain perceives the body as a source of threat",
                "It suppresses the HPA axis permanently, leading to emotional numbness",
                "It has no direct impact on body image, only on cardiovascular health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic minority stress keeps the HPA axis in a state of over-activation, leading the brain to perceive the body itself as a 'site of conflict' or threat, which manifests as hyper-vigilance and dissociation."

                "BDD is successfully treated with HRT, while Dysphoria is treated with SSRIs",
                "Dysphoria is rooted in the incongruence between identity and sex characteristics, while BDD involves an obsessive focus on a perceived 'defect' in appearance",
                "There is no clinical distinction; they are two terms for the same condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gender Dysphoria relates to the alignment of gender identity and physical characteristics, whereas BDD involves a distorted perception of a specific 'flaw' that is often not visible to others and is not inherently related to gender identity."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": [
                "Because trans people lack the biological cues for hunger",
                "Because dysphoria often causes dissociation, making it difficult to feel or interpret internal bodily signals",
                "Because HRT makes it impossible to feel full",
                "It is never challenging; intuitive eating is the easiest path for all clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation is a common coping mechanism for dysphoria. If a client is 'disconnected' from their body to avoid pain, they will struggle to sense internal cues like hunger, fullness, or satisfaction."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Normalizing the emotional 'dip' after surgery is a key part of holistic post-op support. It validates the client's experience as a biological process rather than a failure of their identity or decision."
