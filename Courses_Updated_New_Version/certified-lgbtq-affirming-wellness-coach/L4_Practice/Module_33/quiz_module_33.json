            "question": "A client begins processing intense suicidal ideation linked to historical 'conversion therapy' trauma. According to the Coaching-Therapy Boundary (L1), what is the most appropriate legal and ethical action?",
            "options": [
                "Use advanced coaching techniques to reframe the trauma into a future-focused goal.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed mental health professional or crisis service, as this exceeds coaching scope.",
                "Continue coaching but only focus on the client's career goals to avoid the trauma.",
                "Provide the client with a list of self-help books on trauma recovery while continuing the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Suicidal ideation and historical trauma processing are clinical issues that fall outside the coaching scope of practice. Coaches must refer out to ensure client safety and minimize liability."

            "question": "Under L2 (Data Privacy), why is 'deadnaming' in digital records considered a significant compliance risk for LGBTQ+ affirming coaches?",
            "options": [
                "It is a violation of the coach's personal branding standards.",
                "It can lead to accidental 'outing' if records are subpoenaed or shared with third-party insurers.",
                "It is only a risk if the coach is located in California or the EU.",
                "It automatically invalidates the service agreement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining records with legal names that do not match affirmed identities (deadnaming) creates a high risk of accidental disclosure of a client's trans status, which may violate privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA."

            "options": [
                "Only use the chosen name to ensure the client feels affirmed, even on legal documents.",
                "Only use the legal name throughout the entire document to ensure it is enforceable.",
                "Use the legal name for the signature/party identification section but include a clause recognizing the chosen name/pronouns for all other communication.",
                "Avoid using names altogether and use 'The Client' to remain compliant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a contract to be legally enforceable, the legal identity must be established. However, affirming coaches should include a clause that respects the client's chosen identity for the duration of the relationship."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-discrimination laws often classify businesses (including virtual ones) as public accommodations, meaning they cannot legally deny service based on protected characteristics like gender identity or sexual orientation."

            "explanation": "Professional Indemnity (or Liability) insurance protects the coach from the financial burden of lawsuits claiming the coach provided faulty advice or failed in their professional duty."

                "The coach must report the client to the local authorities in the client's country."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cross-jurisdictional coaching requires an understanding of the client's local legal environment. In high-risk jurisdictions, data privacy and 'stealth' communication become a matter of physical safety and legal compliance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Making clinical claims (like 'curing' dysphoria) or 'guaranteeing' specific emotional outcomes is deceptive and exceeds the scope of coaching, violating ethical marketing standards."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A 2022 study on coaching liability found that 64% of legal disputes arose from 'Scope Creep.' How does this apply to LGBTQ+ affirming coaches?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
