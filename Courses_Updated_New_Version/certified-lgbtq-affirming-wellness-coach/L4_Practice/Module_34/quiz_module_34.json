            "options": [
                "A physical location outside of the coach's office or the client's home.",
                "A psychological 'brave space' that exists between the individual's private identity and the public's heteronormative expectations.",
                "A specific 30-minute window during a workshop dedicated to unstructured networking.",
                "The digital platform used to host hybrid coaching sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Third Space' is a facilitation concept where the group environment acts as a transitional, safe container that allows LGBTQ+ individuals to experiment with their authentic selves away from both private isolation and public scrutiny."

            "question": "According to 'Navigating Intersectional Group Dynamics' (L2), which facilitation technique is most effective when a dominant group member (e.g., a cisgender white man) unintentionally centers their experience over marginalized voices?",
            "options": [
                "Ignoring the behavior to avoid group conflict and maintaining the schedule.",
                "Strict 'Calling Out' to publicly shame the member and set an example.",
                "The 'Progressive Stack' or 'Centering the Margin' technique to prioritize voices that have not yet been heard.",
                "Ending the session early to address the issue privately with the individual."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Progressive Stack' is an intersectional facilitation tool that allows the coach to give priority to those from marginalized subgroups (Trans people of color, etc.) to ensure the group dynamic does not mirror broader societal power imbalances."

            "question": "In 'Designing Transformative Multi-Week Series' (L3), research indicates that the 'Mid-Point Slump' typically occurs during which week of an 8-week program?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that Week 4 is the critical 'Mid-Point Slump' where initial excitement wanes and the 'work' becomes difficult. Coaches should plan a 'Pattern Interrupt' or high-value guest speaker during this week to maintain retention."

                "The time difference between international participants; mitigated by recording sessions.",

                "The technical gap in digital workshops; mitigated by hiring a tech assistant.",
                "The gap between the coach's knowledge and the client's; mitigated by providing more handouts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "One-day intensives often create 'emotional highs' that don't stick. The Integration Gap is the failure to apply these shifts to real life; it is mitigated by providing structured integration support in the week following the intensive."

                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in the industry."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both value lived experience, Group Coaching is defined by professional accountability, specific goal-setting, and a facilitator-led methodology designed to produce measurable progress, whereas peer support is primarily for mutual aid and shared experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For many LGBTQ+ individuals, especially those in 'stealth' or unsupportive environments, digital safety includes the right to anonymity, preventing chat logs from being saved, and ensuring no PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is exposed."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To demonstrate true impact, affirming coaches use validated scales like the IHS/ITS to measure reductions in internalized stigma, which is a primary driver of wellness outcomes in the LGBTQ+ community."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling impact requires the leader to facilitate 'many-to-many' connections, creating a self-sustaining community ecosystem rather than being the sole source of value (one-to-many)."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "A case study in L2 describes a 'Neuro-Inclusive' group design. If a participant with ADHD or Autism feels overwhelmed by high-energy group shares, what is the best facilitator response?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectional facilitation accounts for neurodiversity by providing multiple ways to engage, ensuring that those who process information differently are not excluded from the transformative process."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 90/20 Rule (90 minutes of work, 20 minutes of somatic/integration break) is vital in intensives to prevent 'Emotional Flooding,' where the nervous system becomes too overwhelmed to process any further information or healing."
