            "question": "In the context of Ethical Affirming Brand Positioning (L1), what is the primary difference between a 'neutral' brand and an 'affirming' brand?",
            "options": [
                "A neutral brand avoids politics, while an affirming brand uses pride flags in all logos.",
                "A neutral brand assumes inclusion is implied, while an affirming brand proactively signals safety through specific language and imagery.",
                "An affirming brand is only for LGBTQ+ clients, while a neutral brand is for everyone.",
                "Neutral brands are more profitable because they do not alienate conservative market segments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Affirming brand positioning requires 'proactive signaling'—explicitly stating values and using inclusive language so that marginalized clients don't have to guess if they are safe."

            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Intersectional Audience Segmentation, why is it considered a marketing failure to treat the 'LGBTQ+ community' as a monolith?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the Facebook Ad targeting too expensive.",
                "It ignores the unique health disparities and lived experiences of subsets, such as Black trans women or disabled queer elders.",
                "It is impossible to write content that appeals to both gay men and lesbians.",
                "The community is too small to be considered a single market."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectional segmentation recognizes that a client's experience is shaped by overlapping identities (race, disability, etc.), and marketing must address these specific nuances to be effective and ethical."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed content strategy prioritizes the viewer's nervous system regulation by providing content warnings and avoiding 'scare tactics' or 'pain-point' agitating marketing."

            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Strategic Referral Ecosystems), which partner would be considered a 'High-Value Affirming Ally' for a coach specializing in gender transition wellness?",
            "options": [
                "A local general practitioner who 'doesn't see gender.'",
                "A gender-affirming surgeon or a specialized LGBTQ+ mental health practitioner.",
                "A mainstream weight-loss supplement company.",
                "Any business that has a rainbow sticker in the window."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic referral ecosystems are built on 'circular care,' where you partner with practitioners who see the same specific niche, such as surgeons or therapists specializing in gender identity."

            "options": [
                "It is illegal in most jurisdictions for wellness coaches.",
                "It can trigger 'urgency trauma' and bypass a client's ability to make a regulated, sovereign financial decision.",
                "It makes the coach look like they are not busy enough.",
                "LGBTQ+ clients generally have more time to make decisions and don't care about scarcity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Affirming launches prioritize 'regulated decision making.' High-pressure scarcity tactics can trigger survival responses in trauma-impacted individuals, leading to buyer's remorse or financial instability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-tail keywords that include specific identity markers have higher 'search intent' and lower competition, helping the coach connect with the exact people they are trained to serve."

                "Recording the call without telling the client to ensure 'verbal consent' is captured."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling requires 'community container management.' As you move to groups, the coach must be skilled in facilitating 'Brave Spaces' to prevent harm between participants."

            "question": "A 2023 study referenced in the module suggests that what percentage of LGBTQ+ consumers are more likely to buy from brands that demonstrate a year-round commitment to the community (vs. only during Pride)?",

                "The coach overcomes every objection until the client says yes.",
                "The client makes a choice (Yes or No) that feels aligned and grounded for their current capacity.",
                "The coach convinces the client to take out a loan to afford the coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In trauma-informed sales, success is defined by 'client sovereignty.' A 'grounded no' is a better outcome than a 'pressured yes' because it preserves the therapeutic alliance and the client's autonomy."
