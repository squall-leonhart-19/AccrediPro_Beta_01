            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Somatic Resourcing' when working with a client experiencing chronic minority stress?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate the external sources of systemic oppression immediately",
                "To build internal and external anchors that help regulate the nervous system and increase the window of tolerance",
                "To encourage the client to suppress physical sensations to focus on cognitive logic",
                "To replace all negative emotions with positive affirmations through breathwork"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic resourcing focuses on identifying and strengthening 'resources' (internal or external) that help the client return to a state of regulation, effectively expanding their window of tolerance in the face of chronic stress."

            "question": "In Narrative Re-Authoring (Lesson 2), what is the purpose of 'externalizing' internalized phobias?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client realize that the problem is a result of societal narratives rather than an inherent personal flaw",
                "To blame the client's family for their current psychological state",
                "To ensure the client does not take responsibility for their future actions",
                "To move the coaching session toward a more clinical, diagnostic framework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Externalization is a narrative therapy technique that separates the person from the problem, allowing the client to view internalized phobias as external 'intruders' or societal constructs rather than part of their identity."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A client reports that their physician dismissed their chronic fatigue as 'just part of the stress of being trans.' This is a specific example of:",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when healthcare providers attribute physical symptoms to a patient's marginalized identity (like being trans or having a mental health diagnosis) rather than investigating potential medical causes."

            "question": "According to the principles of Intersectionality (Lesson 4), why is a 'one-size-fits-all' LGBTQ+ coaching approach often ineffective?",
            "options": [
                "Because most LGBTQ+ people have the same exact life experiences",
                "Because marginalization is additive (1+1=2) rather than multiplicative",
                "Because overlapping identities (race, disability, class) create unique, non-additive experiences of discrimination and resilience",
                "Because intersectionality only applies to legal cases, not wellness coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality highlights that social identities do not exist in isolation; they interact to create unique experiences of power and oppression that cannot be understood by looking at one identity at a time."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In hostile environments, trauma-informed coaching prioritizes safety. 'Gray Rocking' involves becoming uninteresting and unresponsive to provocateurs to protect one's emotional energy and physical safety."

            "options": [
                "Neurodivergent people lack empathy entirely",
                "Neurotypical people are superior communicators",
                "There is a mutual mismatch in communication styles and social expectations, rather than a deficit in one party",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties are a 'two-way street' resulting from different ways of processing the world, rather than a 'deficit' inherent to neurodivergent people."

            "options": [
                "Because it is impossible for trans people to love their bodies",
                "Because it focuses on the body's function and existence rather than aesthetic value, which can be more accessible during dysphoria",
                "Because body neutrality requires the client to stop taking hormones",
                "Because body positivity is only for cisgender individuals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body neutrality allows clients to exist in their bodies without the pressure to 'love' parts that cause dysphoria, focusing instead on what the body does for them and its right to exist."

                "Speak for the client in medical appointments",
                "Empower the client to recognize their own agency and navigate systems of power effectively",
                "Provide professional legal representation",
                "Tell the client exactly which political actions to take"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The coach acts as a catalyst by helping the client find their own voice and develop the tools necessary to advocate for themselves within various systems."

            "question": "When coaching an autistic LGBTQ+ client, which somatic consideration is most important regarding 'interoception'?",
            "options": [
                "Assuming the client has the same sensory processing as the coach",
                "Recognizing that interoceptive awareness (sensing internal states) may be hypersensitive or hyposensitive",
                "Using only high-intensity physical exercises",
                "Avoiding all somatic work because neurodivergent people cannot feel their bodies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent clients often have different interoceptive experiences. Coaches must adapt somatic tools to account for potential over- or under-sensitivity to internal bodily signals."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'Internalized Transphobia.' Using Narrative Re-Authoring, what would be an appropriate 'Unique Outcome' or 'Sparkling Moment' to explore?",
            "options": [
                "A time when the client felt ashamed of their identity",
                "A time when the client acted in alignment with their authentic self despite societal pressure",
                "A time when a doctor gaslit the client",
                "A time when the client tried to hide their transition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In narrative coaching, 'Unique Outcomes' are moments that stand outside the 'problem-saturated' story, providing a foundation for a new, more empowering authentic narrative."
