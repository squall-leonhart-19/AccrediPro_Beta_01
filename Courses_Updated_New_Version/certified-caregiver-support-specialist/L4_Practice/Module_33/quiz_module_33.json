            "question": "A client’s daughter presents a 'General Power of Attorney' document. If the client is subsequently diagnosed with advanced dementia and loses mental capacity, what is the legal status of this specific document?",
            "options": [
                "The document remains in full effect until the client's death.",
                "The document automatically terminates because it lacks a 'durability' clause.",
                "The document is upgraded to a 'Durable Power of Attorney' by operation of law.",
                "The document allows the daughter to make healthcare decisions but not financial ones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'General' Power of Attorney terminates upon the principal's incapacity. To remain valid after a client loses capacity, the document must be 'Durable,' explicitly stating it survives incapacity."
