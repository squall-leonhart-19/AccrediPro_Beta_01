                "Instruction focuses on content delivery, while facilitation focuses on the process and collective wisdom of the group.",
                "Facilitation requires a PhD in psychology, whereas instruction only requires a certification.",
                "Instruction is peer-led, while facilitation must be led by a medical professional.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Facilitation is the art of 'making easy,' focusing on guiding the group process and leveraging the participants' shared experiences, whereas instruction is primarily the top-down delivery of specific information."
