        {
            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "In the SOLACE framework for program design (Lesson 1), which component is primarily responsible for ensuring the program remains evidence-based and responsive to participant feedback?",
            "options": ["Support Systems Architecture", "Literacy and Education", "Advocacy and Navigation", "Evaluation and Impact"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'E' in SOLACE stands for Evaluation, which focuses on using data-driven insights and participant feedback to refine the program and ensure clinical efficacy."

        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "When performing an Advanced Situational Analysis (Lesson 2), why is the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) preferred over general stress scales?",
            "options": ["It is shorter and easier to administer in emergency settings", "It specifically distinguishes between objective burden and subjective stress in caregivers", "It provides a definitive diagnosis of clinical depression", "It is the only tool recognized by insurance providers for reimbursement"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ZBI is a psychometric gold standard because it specifically measures the caregiver's experience of burden, distinguishing between external demands (objective) and internal emotional response (subjective)."

        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Objective Alignment, what is the 'Golden Thread' in multi-stakeholder strategic planning?",
            "options": ["The connection between the program budget and the final audit", "The link between individual caregiver goals, clinical outcomes, and organizational mission", "The legal contract signed by all community partners", "The marketing strategy used to recruit new participants"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Thread' refers to the alignment where every activity and goal at the individual level supports the broader clinical and organizational objectives."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 emphasizes Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD). What is the primary shift in thinking required for this approach?",
            "options": ["Focusing on what the community lacks (deficits) to secure more grant funding", "Moving from a 'needs-based' model to identifying and leveraging existing community strengths", "Replacing all professional staff with community volunteers to save costs", "Focusing exclusively on financial assets rather than social capital"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ABCD focuses on the 'half-full' glass, identifying existing resources, skills, and social networks within a community to build sustainable support structures."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Institutionalizing Respite' is described as a critical self-care system. What distinguishes institutionalized respite from traditional respite?",
            "options": ["It is only provided in a hospital or nursing home setting", "It is reactive and used only during a caregiver crisis", "It is a scheduled, recurring, and integrated part of the care plan rather than an occasional luxury", "It requires a physician's prescription to be valid"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Institutionalization means moving respite from a 'crisis-only' intervention to a proactive, systemic, and predictable part of the caregiver's routine."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Resilience Architecting.' Which of the following is a core pillar of a Trauma-Informed Protocol in caregiver support?",
            "options": ["Strict adherence to a rigid daily schedule to ensure predictability", "Prioritizing psychological safety and empowerment to prevent re-traumatization", "Encouraging caregivers to suppress difficult emotions to maintain 'grit'", "Focusing solely on the patient's trauma while ignoring the caregiver's history"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed protocols emphasize safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration, and empowerment to build resilience without causing further harm."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "Under the 'Empowered Advocacy' framework (Lesson 7), what is the primary goal of 'Legislative Influence'?",
            "options": ["Helping an individual client appeal an insurance denial", "Changing macro-level policies, funding streams, or laws to support the caregiving population", "Training caregivers to fill out government forms correctly", "Reducing the number of regulations that programs must follow"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While systems navigation helps individuals, legislative influence focuses on systemic change at the policy or legal level to benefit the entire collective."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "In Program Evaluation (Lesson 8), a 'Logic Model' is used to demonstrate impact. What does the 'Outputs' section of a Logic Model typically record?",
            "options": ["The long-term changes in caregiver health (e.g., lower blood pressure)", "The resources invested, such as staff time and money", "The direct products of program activities, such as the number of workshops held or caregivers trained", "The theoretical framework used to design the intervention"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Outputs are the quantifiable 'units of service' delivered by the program, such as the number of participants served or hours of respite provided."

        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in the module found that programs using 'Data Integration' (Lesson 2) saw a 30% increase in intervention efficacy. Why does data integration improve outcomes?",
            "options": ["It allows for 'precision support' by identifying high-risk caregivers before a crisis occurs", "It automates the caregiving process so humans are no longer needed", "It reduces the cost of software licenses", "It makes it easier to fire underperforming staff"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Data integration combines psychometric scores, health records, and social determinants to allow for proactive, targeted interventions (precision support)."

            "options": ["Relying on a single large federal grant", "Diversifying revenue streams to include private pay, insurance contracts, and philanthropic endowments", "Charging the highest possible market rate to maximize profit", "Eliminating all paid staff positions in favor of an all-volunteer model"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability in program development requires a 'braided' funding approach where multiple sources of income protect the program from the loss of any single funder."
