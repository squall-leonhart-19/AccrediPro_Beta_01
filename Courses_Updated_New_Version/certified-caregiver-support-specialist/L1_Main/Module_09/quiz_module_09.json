            "options": [
                "Objective burden refers to the tangible tasks and time spent caregiving, while subjective burden refers to the caregiver's emotional reaction and perceived stress.",
                "Objective burden is measured by medical professionals, while subjective burden is measured by the family.",
                "Objective burden relates to financial costs, while subjective burden relates to physical health decline.",
                "There is no difference; they are used interchangeably in the S.O.L.A.C.E. Framework™."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Objective burden involves the measurable demands (hours, tasks), whereas subjective burden is the internal, emotional appraisal of those demands by the caregiver."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Porous boundaries are characterized by an inability to say 'no,' over-involvement in others' problems, and a lack of clear personal limits."

            "options": [
                "They are more expensive and therefore more valued.",
                "They focus on consistent, physiological maintenance that prevents burnout rather than temporary escapes from stress.",
                "They allow the caregiver to ignore their responsibilities for longer periods.",
                "They are only intended for use during a crisis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ritual foundations (like consistent sleep hygiene and nutrition) build long-term resilience, whereas reactive pampering only provides short-term relief after stress has already peaked."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "A caregiver feels intense guilt because they 'should' have noticed a decline in their parent's health sooner. Using Cognitive Reframing (L5), how should a specialist help them re-label this 'Guilt'?",

                "Re-label it as 'Incompetence' to encourage better performance.",
                "Re-label it as 'Regret,' acknowledging that while the outcome is sad, there was no intentional 'wrongdoing' or malice.",
                "Ignore the feeling, as guilt is a necessary motivator for caregivers.",
                "Re-label it as 'Total Responsibility' to ensure it doesn't happen again."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing guilt as regret helps remove the element of 'moral failure' or 'malice,' allowing the caregiver to process the sadness without the destructive weight of self-blame."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that high-intensity caregiving leads to health declines in 40-70% of caregivers due to chronic stress and self-care neglect."

                "Practice 'The Pause'—physically stepping away for 2-5 minutes to reset the nervous system if the patient is safe.",
                "Tell the patient they are being difficult to make them feel guilty."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practicing 'The Pause' allows the caregiver's sympathetic nervous system (fight/flight) to de-escalate, preventing a 'snap' reaction and allowing for more rational problem-solving."
