            "question": "According to the Foundations of Psychological Resilience (L1), how is 'bouncing forward' distinguished from 'bouncing back'?",
            "options": [
                "Bouncing back is the only way to return to a pre-crisis baseline.",
                "Bouncing forward refers to Post-Traumatic Growth where the caregiver integrates the crisis to reach a higher level of functioning.",
                "Bouncing forward is a maladaptive strategy that ignores the reality of the trauma.",
                "There is no clinical difference between the two terms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resilience is increasingly viewed as 'bouncing forward' or Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG), where the individual doesn't just return to baseline but develops new strengths and perspectives through the adversity."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A caregiver states, 'If I can't provide 24/7 perfect care for my mother, I am a complete failure.' Which cognitive distortion is being demonstrated here?",
            "options": [
                "Catastrophizing",
                "Emotional Reasoning",
                "All-or-Nothing Thinking (Dichotomous Reasoning)",
                "Personalization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "All-or-nothing thinking involves seeing things in black-and-white categories. If a performance falls short of perfect, the person sees themselves as a total failure, leaving no room for nuance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "In the Window of Tolerance model (L3), a caregiver who feels 'numb, disconnected, and physically exhausted' is likely in which state?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-arousal",
                "The Optimal Zone",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is the 'shutdown' response characterized by numbness, depletion, and a lack of emotional energy. Hyper-arousal, conversely, is characterized by fight-or-flight energy like anger or panic."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Why is the grief experienced by caregivers of individuals with dementia often classified as 'disenfranchised loss'?",
            "options": [
                "Because the person is still physically alive, the caregiver's grief is often not socially recognized or validated.",
                "Because it only occurs after the physical death of the care recipient.",
                "Because it is a form of grief that caregivers choose to ignore.",
                "Because it is legally recognized but clinically insignificant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a loss cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially supported. Caregivers often mourn the 'living loss' of a person's personality or memory while they are still physically present."

            "options": [
                "To eliminate all negative thoughts from the caregiver's mind.",
                "To replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations.",
                "To see thoughts as just words or images rather than absolute truths that must be obeyed.",
                "To analyze the childhood origins of every distressing thought."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion helps caregivers create space between themselves and their thoughts, recognizing that a thought like 'I can't do this' is just a mental event, not an objective reality."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key clinical differentiator between Burnout and Compassion Fatigue (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is sudden, while Compassion Fatigue takes years to develop.",
                "Burnout is primarily related to the work environment and resources, while Compassion Fatigue is the relational 'cost of caring' for suffering individuals.",
                "Burnout only affects physical health, while Compassion Fatigue only affects spiritual health.",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms in caregiver support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout is generally related to environmental stressors (workload, lack of resources), whereas Compassion Fatigue (Secondary Traumatic Stress) stems specifically from the emotional toll of witnessing the suffering of others."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "A caregiver uses 'experiential avoidance' as a coping mechanism. According to Lesson 7, why is this considered maladaptive in the long term?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the caregiver's physical strength but decreases cognitive ability.",
                "It leads to 'rebound effects' where suppressed emotions return with greater intensity.",
                "It is the most effective way to manage chronic stress.",
                "It prevents the caregiver from ever feeling any physical pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Experiential avoidance (trying to avoid or suppress difficult thoughts/feelings) is maladaptive because it usually leads to those emotions returning more forcefully and prevents the person from taking values-based action."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "When building a Resilience Maintenance Plan (RMP), what does the '1% Rule' suggest for long-term sustainability?",
            "options": [
                "Caregivers should only spend 1% of their day on caregiving tasks.",
                "Small, consistent micro-interventions (1% shifts) are more sustainable and effective than sporadic, major life overhauls.",
                "Only 1% of caregivers are capable of achieving true resilience.",
                "Caregivers should donate 1% of their income to support groups."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 1% Rule emphasizes that sustainable change comes from small, manageable shifts in daily habits rather than waiting for a crisis to make massive, unsustainable changes."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "In the context of Anticipatory Grief (L4), what is 'Ambiguous Loss'?",
            "options": [
                "A loss where there is no closure, such as when a person is physically present but psychologically absent.",
                "A loss that occurs only in financial settings.",
                "A loss that the caregiver refuses to admit has happened.",
                "A loss that occurs suddenly without any warning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ambiguous loss, a term coined by Pauline Boss, refers to situations where a person is physically present but psychologically absent (like in dementia) or vice versa (like a missing person)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Based on the module's teaching on Emotional Regulation (L3), what is the first step a caregiver should take when they recognize they are moving outside their Window of Tolerance?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the feeling and push through the task.",
                "Utilize 'Grounding' or 'Top-Down' regulation strategies to stabilize the nervous system.",
                "Immediately quit their caregiving responsibilities.",
                "Wait 24 hours before taking any action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The priority when leaving the Window of Tolerance is stabilization. Grounding (bottom-up) or cognitive reframing (top-down) helps bring the nervous system back into the optimal zone of functioning."
