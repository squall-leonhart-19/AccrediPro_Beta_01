            "options": [
                "To set long-term medical goals for the care recipient",

                "To immediately implement a self-care routine for the caregiver",
                "To negotiate financial arrangements between family members"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Situational Analysis is about 'Mapping the Landscape' to identify visible and hidden stressors, ensuring the caregiver has a realistic understanding of their current environment before taking action."
