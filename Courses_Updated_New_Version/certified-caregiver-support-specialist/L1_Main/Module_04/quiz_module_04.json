            "question": "Which physiological process is primarily responsible for the 'allostatic load' experienced by caregivers under chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system during emergencies",
                "The wear and tear on the body caused by chronic over-activation of the HPA axis",
                "A temporary increase in dopamine levels during caregiving tasks",
                "The rapid recovery of the parasympathetic nervous system after a stressor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the cumulative 'wear and tear' on the body resulting from chronic over-exposure to stress hormones like cortisol, primarily driven by the HPA axis."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Micro-Restorative Practices,' why is emphasizing a long exhalation (e.g., 4-7-8 breathing) effective for a caregiver's physiology?",
            "options": [
                "It increases blood glucose levels for immediate energy",
                "It stimulates the vagus nerve to trigger the parasympathetic 'rest and digest' response",
                "It raises cortisol levels to help the caregiver stay alert",
                "It prevents the need for any formal respite or sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longer exhalations signal the vagus nerve to slow the heart rate and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, countering the 'fight or flight' response."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "When designing a 'Respite Blueprint,' what is the primary purpose of identifying 'Informal Respite' sources first?",
            "options": [
                "To replace all professional medical care with family members",
                "To reduce the financial burden by utilizing existing social support networks",
                "To prove to the care recipient that they don't need outside help",
                "To satisfy legal requirements for home-based care"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Blueprint prioritizes informal respite (friends, family, community) to build a sustainable, cost-effective support layer before or alongside formal professional services."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Combining protein (yogurt), healthy fats (walnuts), and fiber (berries) slows glucose absorption, providing stable energy and preventing the irritability associated with blood sugar crashes."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to Sleep Hygiene principles, what is the 'Circadian Anchor' most caregivers should prioritize to improve sleep quality?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Morning sunlight exposure is the primary zeitgeber (time-giver) that regulates the circadian rhythm, helping the body produce melatonin at the correct time in the evening."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Movement integration involves 'movement snacks' or functional movements performed throughout the day, which maintains mobility and reduces the physiological impact of sedentary stress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
