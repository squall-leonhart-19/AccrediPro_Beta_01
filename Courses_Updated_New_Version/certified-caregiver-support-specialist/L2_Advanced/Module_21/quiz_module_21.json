            "options": [
                "It ensures the caregiver works harder to meet the professional's expectations.",
                "It prevents 'Goal Abandonment' by ensuring milestones are achievable and respect the caregiver's current capacity.",
                "It allows the healthcare team to bill for more specific clinical outcomes.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the patient's recovery rather than the caregiver's well-being."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Objective Alignment ensures that goals are realistic; setting overly ambitious milestones for a stressed caregiver often leads to the 'failure effect,' resulting in total abandonment of the support plan."
