            "question": "Which ethical principle is most directly challenged when a Caregiver Support Specialist must decide whether to report a caregiver's minor neglect that stems from extreme exhaustion rather than malice?",
            "options": [
                "The Principle of Utility",
                "Non-maleficence (Do No Harm)",

                "The Objective Alignment Process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-maleficence requires the professional to avoid causing harm. In this dilemma, the specialist must weigh the harm of the neglect against the potential harm of intervention (e.g., removing the caregiver), seeking the path that minimizes overall injury."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Paternalistic Beneficence occurs when a professional or caregiver overrides a person's autonomy (their right to choose) for the sake of that person's perceived well-being or safety."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A Support Specialist is working with a caregiver who admits to feeling 'resentful' of their spouse. The caregiver asks the Specialist not to tell the spouse. Under 'Confidentiality in Multi-Party Dynamics,' what is the correct protocol?",

                "The Specialist must immediately report this to the spouse to ensure transparency.",

                "To force the care recipient to agree with every medical recommendation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Objective Alignment Process is a tool used to keep the professional relationship focused on specific outcomes, ensuring that empathy does not lead to 'boundary blurring' or 'compassion fatigue'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vertical equity is the principle that those in different circumstances (higher need) should be treated differently (receive more support) to achieve a more equitable outcome."

                "The Specialist should report the son for elder abuse and coercion.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural competence involves 'Ethical Sensitivity,' which recognizes that different cultures value autonomy and decision-making differently (e.g., collectivism vs. individualism). The goal is to respect these values while ensuring safety."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that over 60% of caregivers experience 'moral distress'—the psychological tension that arises when one knows the right ethical action but is prevented from taking it due to institutional or resource constraints."
