            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evaluation in the S.O.1.A.C.E. Framework™ is not a final step but a continuous loop that ensures interventions remain relevant as the caregiving ecosystem evolves."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Administrative burden is a systemic stressor that is often 'hidden' because it is perceived as 'just part of the job,' yet it contributes significantly to decision fatigue and burnout."

                "It improves the caregiver's physical strength for patient transfers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VNS through techniques like box breathing or physiological sighs helps transition the brain from a state of hyper-vigilance (High-Beta) to a restorative state (Alpha/Theta)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainability requires redundancy; if a single point of failure (like one specific neighbor) is the only backup, the care plan is not resilient."
