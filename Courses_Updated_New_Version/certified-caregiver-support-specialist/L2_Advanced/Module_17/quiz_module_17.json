            "question": "A caregiver attributes a client's new onset of acute confusion solely to their existing Alzheimer's diagnosis, failing to notice a developing UTI. This clinical error is known as:",
            "options": [
                "Confirmation Bias",
                "Diagnostic Overshadowing",
                "Cognitive Dissonance",
                "Retrospective Stability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when clinicians or caregivers attribute new physical or psychological symptoms to a client's pre-existing chronic condition (like dementia or a disability), leading to missed diagnoses of treatable acute issues."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In the context of family mediation (Lesson 2), what is the primary difference between 'Position-Based' and 'Interest-Based' negotiation?",
            "options": [
                "Position-based focuses on legal rights; interest-based focuses on financial outcomes.",
                "Position-based is always aggressive; interest-based is always passive.",
                "Position-based focuses on 'what' a party demands; interest-based focuses on 'why' they want it.",
                "There is no functional difference in a caregiving context."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interest-based negotiation looks beneath the surface demands (positions) to find the underlying needs, fears, or goals (interests), which often reveals common ground between conflicting family members."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "When managing a client exhibiting 'Level 3: Physical Aggression' according to the Clinical Behavioral Management protocol, what is the specialist's priority?",
            "options": [
                "Reasoning with the client to explain why their behavior is inappropriate.",
                "Setting firm verbal boundaries and threatening loss of privileges.",
                "Safety, space, and non-confrontational stance.",
                "Immediate administration of PRN (as-needed) sedative medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Once a client reaches physical aggression, the 'verbal reasoning' window has closed. The priority is the safety of the client and caregiver, maintaining physical distance, and using a non-threatening posture to allow the surge of adrenaline to dissipate."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "The concept of 'Total Pain' in palliative care, developed by Dame Cicely Saunders, encompasses which four dimensions?",

                "Initial, Intermediate, Terminal, and Post-mortem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total Pain recognizes that a terminal patient's suffering is not just physical; it is an interlocking experience of physical symptoms, mental anxiety, social abandonment or family conflict, and spiritual distress or loss of meaning."

                "Argue against cultural myths that interfere with medical treatment.",
                "Assess the client's financial ability to pay for culturally specific care.",
                "Acknowledge and discuss the differences and similarities in perceptions of the problem.",
                "Ask the family to abandon their traditions for the sake of clinical efficiency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Acknowledge' phase of the LEARN model (Listen, Acknowledge, Recommend, Negotiate) involves validating the client's perspective and discussing where their cultural view of the illness overlaps or differs from the clinical view."

            "question": "A 'Springing' Power of Attorney is distinguished from a 'Durable' Power of Attorney because it:",

                "Only applies to real estate transactions.",
                "Remains in effect even if the principal becomes incapacitated.",

                "Cannot be revoked once it is signed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Springing' POA 'springs' into action only when a specific condition is met (usually clinical incapacity), whereas a 'Durable' POA is effective immediately and continues through incapacity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Depersonalization is a core component of burnout/compassion fatigue where the caregiver loses the ability to see the client as a human being, significantly increasing the risk of neglect or abuse."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In remote caregiving technology, 'Ambient Sensing' is preferred over 'Wearable Tech' for clients with advanced dementia because:",
            "options": [
                "It is significantly cheaper to install.",
                "It does not require the client to remember to wear or charge a device.",
                "It provides 4K video surveillance of all private activities.",
                "It allows the caregiver to speak to the client through a robotic interface."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients with dementia often remove, lose, or forget to charge wearables (like Apple Watches or LifeAlert pendants). Ambient sensing (motion/pressure sensors) monitors patterns without requiring client compliance."

            "question": "A specialist is mediating a conflict where a son wants 'aggressive' life-prolonging treatment for his mother, while the daughter wants 'comfort care.' The specialist's best approach is to:",
            "options": [
                "Side with the daughter because comfort care is usually more humane.",
                "Side with the son because he is likely the oldest child.",
                "Refocus the conversation on the mother's previously stated values and 'substituted judgment.'",
                "Tell the family to come back when they have reached a unanimous decision."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In ethical caregiving, 'substituted judgment' involves asking 'What would the mother want if she could speak for herself right now?' rather than what the children want for her."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "Statistics from Lesson 7 indicate that 'High-Intensity' caregivers (providing 20+ hours of care per week) are how much more likely to report high emotional stress compared to low-intensity caregivers?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10% more likely.",
                "Roughly twice as likely (approx. 46% vs 24%).",

                "Five times more likely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that as care intensity increases, emotional stress nearly doubles, with high-intensity caregivers reporting significantly higher rates of physical and mental health decline."
