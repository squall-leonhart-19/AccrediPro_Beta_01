            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Role strain in the Sandwich Generation is primarily driven by the psychological conflict of providing developmental support to children while managing the degenerative decline of a parent, often leading to 'competing cognitive dissonance.'"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Validation Method (Feil, 1982) emphasizes entering the client's perceived reality to reduce agitation, whereas Reality Orientation can increase distress in advanced stages of dementia."
