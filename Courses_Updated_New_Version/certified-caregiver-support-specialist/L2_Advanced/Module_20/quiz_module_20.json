            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "On the ZBI-22, scores between 41–60 indicate moderate to severe burden, while scores between 61–88 indicate severe burden. However, in many clinical frameworks, a score exceeding 50 is the threshold for 'Severe Burden' requiring immediate intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
