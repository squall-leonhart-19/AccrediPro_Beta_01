            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for professional liability insurance entirely",
                "It creates a 'corporate veil' that protects personal assets from business-related lawsuits",
                "It allows the coach to practice therapy without a clinical license",
                "It is the only entity structure that allows for group coaching programs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LLC provides a legal separation between the individual and the business, protecting personal assets (like a home or personal savings) from being seized to satisfy business debts or legal judgments."

                "It encourages clients to solve their problems too quickly",
                "It ties income directly to hours worked, creating a hard revenue ceiling and devaluing long-term outcomes",
                "It is illegal in most jurisdictions for parenting coaches"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing limits a coach's earning potential to the number of hours they can physically work and focuses the client's attention on the cost per hour rather than the value of the transformation."
