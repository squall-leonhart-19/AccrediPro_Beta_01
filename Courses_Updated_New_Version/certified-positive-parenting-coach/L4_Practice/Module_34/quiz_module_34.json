            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peer-to-peer interaction in group coaching helps parents realize they are not alone (normalization) and builds confidence as they help others solve problems (self-efficacy)."

            "question": "When launching a 'Signature Group Program,' why is a 'Beta' or 'Founding Member' launch recommended?",
            "options": ["To charge the highest possible price immediately", "To test the curriculum with a smaller group and gather testimonials before a full-scale launch", "To avoid having to create any content until after the program is over", "To ensure that only 'expert' parents join the first round"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Beta launch allows the coach to refine the curriculum based on real-time feedback and secure 'social proof' (testimonials) which is vital for future marketing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "A 'Know-It-All' participant frequently challenges your evidence-based coaching with their own 'common sense' advice. How should a Master Facilitator handle this?",
            "options": ["Publicly correct them using scientific data to assert dominance", "Ignore them and hope the other parents don't listen", "Leverage their experience by asking them to share a specific time that approach worked, then bridge it back to the core lesson", "Ask them to leave the group immediately for non-compliance"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validating their experience while redirecting the focus back to the curriculum maintains group harmony and prevents the participant from becoming defensive or disruptive."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that purely self-paced online courses have low completion rates (often 5-15%), which is why adding a 'group' or 'coaching' element is critical for impact."
