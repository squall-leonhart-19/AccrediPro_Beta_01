            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaching is not therapy. Clinical issues like depression and self-harm fall outside the coaching scope of practice. Coaches must refer clients to licensed professionals to ensure safety and avoid 'practicing medicine without a license.'"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An 'Occurrence' policy covers any incident that happens during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is actually filed, unlike 'Claims-made' policies which require the policy to be active at the time of the claim."
