            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary distinction between Positive Parenting Coaching and clinical psychotherapy?",
            "options": [
                "Coaching focuses on future-oriented goals and behavioral strategies, while therapy often addresses clinical diagnoses and healing past trauma.",
                "Coaching is only for parents of healthy children, while therapy is for parents of children with disabilities.",
                "Coaching allows for the prescription of medication, whereas therapy does not.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in the NURTURE framework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Coaching is a forward-looking, goal-oriented process. Unlike therapy, it does not involve diagnosing mental health disorders or treating deep-seated psychological trauma."

            "question": "A coach is working with a parent who admits they are 'at their wit's end' and mentions they occasionally leave their 4-year-old home alone for an hour to run errands. What is the coach's primary ethical obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest a better childcare provider to solve the problem.",
                "Maintain absolute confidentiality as part of the coaching contract.",
                "Follow mandated reporting protocols, as this constitutes a reasonable suspicion of child neglect.",
                "Wait until the next session to see if the behavior continues before taking action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mandated reporting laws require coaches to report 'reasonable suspicion' of neglect or abuse. Leaving a young child unattended constitutes neglect in most jurisdictions and requires immediate reporting."

                "Tell the parent immediately to maintain the 'Parent as Lead' philosophy.",
                "Keep the secret indefinitely, regardless of its nature.",
                "Refer to the 'Zones of Privacy' established in the Informed Consent and encourage the teen to share it with the parent if it impacts the family dynamic.",
                "End the coaching relationship immediately due to a conflict of interest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical family coaching requires establishing 'Zones of Privacy' in the initial contract. This allows for a safe space for the child while maintaining a path toward transparency for issues that affect the family's health."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A dual relationship occurs when a coach has a secondary relationship with a client (social, professional, or familial). Coaching your child's teacher creates a conflict of interest and potential power imbalance."

            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "In the context of Cultural Competency, what does the 'U' in the NURTURE framework emphasize regarding ethics?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In an ethical context, 'Understanding' involves recognizing that parenting 'best practices' can vary across cultures and that the coach must check their own implicit biases before making recommendations."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "What is the ethical risk of using 'guilt' as a motivational tool to get a parent to comply with a coaching plan?",
            "options": [
                "It is a highly effective long-term strategy for behavioral change.",
                "It is acceptable as long as the parent eventually sees results.",
                "It violates the 'Ethics of Influence' by using coercion rather than empowerment, often leading to client shame and withdrawal.",
                "Guilt is not an emotion addressed in the NURTURE framework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ethics of Influence requires coaches to avoid coercive tactics. Shaming or guilting a parent undermines their self-efficacy and the collaborative nature of the coaching relationship."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transparency is key to ethics. Clients must be informed upfront that while coaching is private, legal obligations (like mandated reporting) override confidentiality."

        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "A coach finds themselves feeling intense anger toward a client who uses 'time-outs' excessively. This emotional reaction from the coach is known as:",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference is when a coach redirects their own feelings or 'triggers' onto a client. Ethical practice requires the coach to recognize this and seek supervision or self-regulation."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "If a client reveals during a session that they are experiencing symptoms of severe clinical depression and are unable to care for their child, what is the most ethical 'Scope of Practice' response?",
            "options": [
                "Increase coaching sessions to three times a week to provide more support.",
                "Suggest specific antidepressants that have worked for other clients.",
                "Provide a referral to a licensed mental health professional while maintaining a supportive coaching role for parenting-specific goals.",
                "Tell the client to 'stay positive' and focus on the NURTURE steps."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client's needs exceed the scope of coaching (e.g., clinical depression), the ethical response is to refer them to a qualified therapist or psychiatrist while continuing to support their parenting goals if appropriate."

            "id": "q22_10",

            "options": [
                "Because coaches must never show any emotion during a session.",
                "To ensure the coach's personal stress and biases do not interfere with the client's progress or the quality of the guidance provided.",
                "Because it allows the coach to charge higher fees.",
                "It is a legal requirement in all 50 states for coaching certification."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-regulation is an ethical imperative because an unregulated coach cannot provide a 'safe container' for the client, potentially leading to poor advice or emotional harm."
