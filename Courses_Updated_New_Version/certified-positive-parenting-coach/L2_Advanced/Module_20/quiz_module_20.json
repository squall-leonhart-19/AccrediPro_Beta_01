            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "When mapping the Family Ecosystem (L1), which layer includes influences that the child does not interact with directly, such as a parent's workplace stress or local school board policies?",
            "options": [
                "The Microsystem",
                "The Mesosystem",
                "The Exosystem",
                "The Macrosystem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on Bronfenbrenner’s Bioecological Model used in the Advanced Intake, the Exosystem refers to settings that impact the child's development indirectly by affecting someone in their Microsystem (like a parent)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In the 'ABC' model of Objective Behavioral Tracking (L2), what does the 'C' represent, and why is it critical for assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Cognition; it tracks what the child was thinking during the event.",
                "Consequence; it identifies what happened immediately after the behavior to see if it was reinforced.",
                "Correction; it lists the specific punishment the parent administered.",
                "Communication; it tracks how the parent explained the rule to the child."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Consequence follows the behavior and helps the coach understand if the behavior is being reinforced (encouraged to continue) or discouraged by the environment."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A child who frequently crashes into furniture, enjoys 'rough and tumble' play, and prefers tight-fitting clothing is likely showing signs of which sensory profile (L3)?",
            "options": [
                "Proprioceptive seeking (under-responsive to deep pressure)",
                "Auditory hypersensitivity",
                "Vestibular avoiding (over-responsive to movement)",
                "Tactile defensiveness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Seeking deep pressure, 'crashing,' and heavy input are hallmarks of a proprioceptive seeking profile, where the child needs more input to feel where their body is in space."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "According to the Parental Self-Assessment Inventories (L4), what is the primary indicator of high 'Co-regulation Capacity'?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to stop a child's meltdown in under 60 seconds.",
                "The parent's ability to maintain their own physiological 'Green Zone' while the child is in the 'Red Zone'.",
                "The parent's ability to strictly enforce consequences without feeling any emotion.",
                "The total absence of parental triggers during high-stress transitions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation is the parent's ability to stay regulated themselves so they can act as an external nervous system for their dysregulated child."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "During an Attachment & Bond Audit (L5), a coach observes a 'Secure Base' behavior. What does this look like in a real-world setting?",
            "options": [
                "The child clings to the parent's leg and refuses to play with others.",
                "The child ignores the parent entirely and focuses only on toys.",
                "The child explores a new environment but periodically returns to or looks at the parent for 'emotional refueling'.",
                "The child becomes inconsolable when the parent leaves and remains angry when they return."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A secure attachment is characterized by the child using the parent as a 'secure base' from which to explore the world, checking back for safety and connection."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "When using the Discipline Strategy Effectiveness Map (L6), a strategy is deemed 'Ineffective/High Cost' if it:",
            "options": [
                "Corrects the behavior immediately but damages the parent-child bond.",
                "Takes a long time to implement but teaches a new skill.",
                "Requires the parent to stay calm during a tantrum.",
                "Involves natural consequences that the child dislikes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-cost strategies are those that may achieve short-term compliance (correction) at the expense of long-term connection or the child's self-esteem."

            "id": "q20_7",

                "Doing the task for the child to show them how it's done perfectly.",
                "Giving the child total independence before they have the skills to succeed.",
                "Providing the minimum amount of support necessary for the child to successfully complete a task themselves.",
                "Creating a rigid reward system for every completed chore."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves adjusting the level of support to match the child's current ability, gradually removing it as they gain competence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In Outcome Measurement (L8), why is it important to track 'Intensity' and 'Duration' rather than just 'Frequency' of outbursts?",
            "options": [
                "Because frequency is too hard for parents to count.",
                "Because a reduction in intensity (e.g., from hitting to yelling) shows significant progress in self-regulation even if the frequency is the same.",
                "Because intensity is the only metric that insurance companies care about.",
                "Because duration is always the last thing to change in a behavioral intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progress in positive parenting is often incremental; a child moving from a 30-minute physical meltdown to a 5-minute verbal protest is a major success in regulation capacity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A 'Bond Audit' (L5) reveals a high 'Correction-to-Connection' ratio (e.g., 5:1). What is the evidence-based recommendation for improving this outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the severity of punishments so the child listens the first time.",
                "Ignore all negative behaviors for one month.",
                "Aim for a 'Magic Ratio' of at least 5 positive/connective interactions for every 1 corrective interaction.",
                "Stop all verbal communication and use only written charts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (notably by Gottman and others) suggests that healthy, resilient relationships require a high ratio of positive interactions to offset the impact of necessary corrections."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A parent reports their child is 'lazy' about homework. The coach uses a Competence Scale (L7) and finds the child lacks 'Executive Function' skills for organization. What is the correct assessment-led intervention?",
            "options": [
                "The child is unmotivated and needs stricter consequences.",
                "The child has a 'Skill Gap,' not a 'Will Gap,' and needs external organizational tools (scaffolding).",
                "The child is seeking attention and should be ignored until the work is done.",
                "The parent should do the homework with the child to ensure it gets done."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessment tools often reveal that 'defiance' or 'laziness' is actually a lack of specific developmental skills, requiring a teaching approach rather than a punitive one."
