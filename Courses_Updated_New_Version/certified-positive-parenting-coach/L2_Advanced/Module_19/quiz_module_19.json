            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for executive function and emotional regulation, showing increased gray matter density in children with secure attachment?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is the center for higher-order thinking and emotional regulation; secure attachment is linked to healthier PFC development and better 'top-down' regulation of the amygdala."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "According to longitudinal research, what is a primary correlate of frequent corporal punishment (spanking) in early childhood?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extensive longitudinal data, including meta-analyses of over 160,000 children, consistently link corporal punishment to increased aggression, mental health problems, and lower moral internalization."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In Polyvagal Theory, the 'Social Engagement System' is governed by which branch of the nervous system?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (the 'smart vagus') supports the social engagement system, allowing for calm, connection, and the ability to self-soothe and co-regulate."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A parent says, 'If my child doesn't learn to share now, he'll grow up to be a selfish person that no one likes.' This is an example of which cognitive distortion?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fortune telling involves predicting a negative future outcome without sufficient evidence, often leading to increased parental anxiety and over-control."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Self-Determination Theory (SDT) posits that intrinsic motivation is fostered when which three basic psychological needs are met?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The research showed that 'high-licking and grooming' mothers produced offspring with lower methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, leading to a more efficient HPA axis and better stress resilience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progress monitoring allows the coach to see if the current strategy is working, providing objective data to pivot or reinforce specific techniques based on client outcomes."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A child is in a 'shutdown' or 'collapsed' state (immobilization). According to Polyvagal Theory, what is the most effective first step for a parent?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a child is in a Dorsal Vagal (shutdown) state, the primary goal is to signal safety through the 'Social Engagement System' (voice, face, posture) to help them move back toward a regulated state."

                "Certain children are more sensitive to both negative and positive environments (the 'Orchid' child)",
                "Environment has no impact on gene expression in the first five years",
                "Only negative parenting affects brain development; positive parenting has no measurable effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Differential susceptibility suggests that children with certain genetic markers are more vulnerable to poor parenting but also benefit significantly more from high-quality, positive parenting."
