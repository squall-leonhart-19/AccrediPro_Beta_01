            "id": "q21_1",
            "question": "During the Advanced Intake and Clinical Observation phase, why is 'triangulating' data from multiple sources (e.g., school, home, and coach observation) considered essential?",
            "options": [
                "To prove the parent is being untruthful about the child's behavior.",
                "To identify context-specific triggers and reduce the impact of individual reporter bias.",
                "To increase the billable hours for the intake process.",
                "To ensure the child feels outnumbered so they will comply with the plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation allows the coach to see if behaviors are consistent across environments or specific to one, which helps isolate environmental triggers vs. skill deficits while minimizing subjective bias from a single reporter."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In the context of Case Formulation, how is a 'Lagging Skill' distinguished from 'Willful Defiance'?",
            "options": [
                "Lagging skills are only present in children with diagnosed ADHD.",
                "Willful defiance requires punishment, while lagging skills require coaching.",
                "A lagging skill is a neurological or developmental inability to meet an expectation, regardless of motivation.",
                "There is no distinction; all defiance is a result of a lack of discipline."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case formulation in positive parenting views 'misbehavior' as a clash between environmental demands and the child's current skill level (lagging skills), rather than a simple choice to be 'bad'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Regulation Roadmap' protocol, what is the mandatory first step before implementing any behavioral 'Teach' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Establishing a system of rewards and consequences.",
                "Ensuring the parent has achieved physiological self-regulation.",
                "Having the child sign a behavioral contract.",
                "Explaining the logic of the rule to the child while they are in a 'meltdown'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Regulation Roadmap dictates that co-regulation cannot occur if the parent is dysregulated. A parent's calm nervous system is the primary tool for stabilizing the child's nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When 'Strategic Intervention Mapping,' why is the 'Unite' phase prioritized alongside the 'Teach' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To make the child like the coach more than the parent.",
                "To distract the child from the fact that they are learning new rules.",
                "Because a secure attachment bond increases the child's neurological receptivity to learning and influence.",
                "To ensure the parent doesn't feel like they are being too 'mean' during the teaching phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Unite' phase focuses on connection. Neurobiology shows that children in a state of 'threat' (disconnected) cannot access the prefrontal cortex required for the 'Teach' phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "In the 'Reinforce Growth' phase, what is the primary function of 'Behavioral Scaffolding'?",
            "options": [
                "Providing permanent support so the child never fails.",
                "Using physical barriers to prevent the child from engaging in bad behaviors.",
                "Providing temporary, adjustable supports that are gradually faded as the child gains competence.",
                "A strict 1:1 supervision model that lasts for the duration of the coaching contract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding is a developmental tool where the coach/parent provides just enough support for the child to succeed, then slowly removes that support to foster independent mastery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A coach is helping a parent set goals for 'Empowering Autonomy.' Which of the following goals best aligns with the 'Emotional Maturity' framework?",
            "options": [
                "The child will stop crying within 2 minutes of being told 'no'.",
                "The child will receive a sticker for every day they do not hit their sibling.",
                "The child will identify one self-regulation strategy to use independently when feeling frustrated.",
                "The parent will exert more control over the child's daily schedule to prevent outbursts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autonomy and maturity involve moving from extrinsic control (stickers/compliance) to intrinsic skill-building and self-efficacy (choosing a strategy independently)."
        },

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "If progress monitoring data shows a 'plateau' or regression after 4 weeks of consistent implementation, what does the 'Data-Driven Adjustment' protocol suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately terminate the coaching relationship for lack of progress.",
                "Increase the severity of the consequences in the plan.",
                "Re-evaluate the Case Formulation to determine if the root cause or lagging skill was misidentified.",
                "Tell the parent to try harder for another 4 weeks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A lack of progress usually indicates a 'mismatch' between the intervention and the root cause. The coach must return to the formulation phase to see if they missed a physiological, sensory, or skill-based factor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Which scenario represents a 'Scope of Practice' violation for a Positive Parenting Coach?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches do not diagnose clinical mental health disorders. If a coach suspects a clinical condition, they must refer the client to a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist."

        {
            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A case study shows a child who is 'aggressive' only during math homework. The coach identifies the root cause as 'Performance Anxiety' rather than 'Poor Discipline.' What is the most appropriate intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Losing screen time for every aggressive outburst during homework.",
                "Breaking the math tasks into smaller, 'micro-success' steps (scaffolding).",
                "Telling the child they must 'tough it out' to build resilience.",
                "Moving the homework time to earlier in the day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If the root cause is anxiety/skill-gap, the intervention must address the anxiety through scaffolding and building confidence, rather than punishing the symptom of aggression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Gold Standard' indicator that a family is ready for Termination Planning?",

                "The child has had zero behavioral incidents for 7 consecutive days.",
                "The parent has paid for all their sessions in full.",
                "The parent demonstrates the ability to independently apply the case formulation process to new, emerging challenges.",
                "The coach has run out of lessons to teach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal of coaching is to make the coach obsolete. Success is measured by the parent's ability to 'think like a coach' and handle future challenges using the framework they've learned."
