            "question": "When coaching a family with a child experiencing Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) who is 'sensory over-responsive,' which environment modification is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the volume of background music to mask sudden noises",
                "Using 'heavy work' activities like pushing a vacuum to provide proprioceptive input",
                "Reducing environmental triggers such as fluorescent lighting and loud textures",
                "Implementing a strict 'no-complaining' rule regarding clothing tags"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For over-responsive children, the primary goal is to reduce overwhelming stimuli. 'Heavy work' (proprioceptive input) is often used for regulation, but the specific modification for over-responsivity is environmental reduction of triggers."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In high-conflict divorce cases, 'Parallel Parenting' is often recommended over 'Co-Parenting' because:",
            "options": [
                "It requires parents to attend all social events together for the child's sake",
                "It minimizes direct contact between parents to reduce conflict while maintaining child-parent bonds",
                "It allows one parent to make 100% of the decisions without consulting the other",
                "It encourages the child to act as the primary messenger between households"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel parenting is a method where parents lead separate lives and have little to no contact with each other, which is essential in high-conflict cases to protect the child from witnessing parental hostility."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to the PACE model (Playfulness, Acceptance, Curiosity, Empathy) used for children with Reactive Attachment patterns, what is the purpose of 'Curiosity'?",
            "options": [
                "To figure out which punishment will be most effective",
                "To ask the child 'Why did you do that?' until they provide a logical answer",
                "To wonder aloud about the child's internal experience without judgment",
                "To investigate the child's room for hidden items"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Curiosity in PACE involves 'stating the obvious' or wondering aloud (e.g., 'I wonder if you were feeling scared when...') to help the child understand their own emotions without feeling interrogated."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Research on Pediatric Medical Traumatic Stress (PMTS) suggests that what percentage of children with chronic illnesses exhibit significant traumatic stress symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "Approximately 15-25%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Over 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that 15-25% of children (and their parents) experiencing chronic or acute medical conditions meet the criteria for significant traumatic stress."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In Dr. Ross Greene’s 'Collaborative & Proactive Solutions' (CPS) model, physical aggression is viewed as:",
            "options": [
                "A sign of a 'bad' child who needs stronger discipline",
                "A manipulative tactic to get what they want",
                "A result of lagging cognitive skills in areas like flexibility and frustration tolerance",
                "A lack of respect for authority figures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CPS model posits that 'kids do well if they can' and that physical aggression is a symptom of lagging skills, not a lack of will or character."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "When addressing deep-seated sibling resentment, a coach should advise parents to transition from 'Equality' (the same for everyone) to 'Equity.' What does this look like in practice?",
            "options": [
                "Giving every child exactly 15 minutes of attention regardless of need",
                "Meeting each child's unique emotional and developmental needs individually",
                "Buying the exact same toys for all children to prevent fighting",
                "Ignoring the older child's needs to focus entirely on the newborn"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Equity recognizes that different children have different needs at different times. Attempting 'perfect equality' often fuels resentment because it ignores the individual's specific emotional requirements."

            "question": "The 'Brain Gap' in adolescence refers to the developmental mismatch between which two brain regions?",

                "The Left Hemisphere and the Right Hemisphere"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala matures early, driving intense emotions and reward-seeking, while the Prefrontal Cortex (responsible for impulse control) doesn't fully mature until the mid-20s, creating the 'gap' that leads to risky behavior."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "A 'Twice-Exceptional' (2e) child is best described as having:",
            "options": [
                "High IQ scores in two or more academic subjects",
                "Two different learning disabilities that cancel each other out",
                "High intellectual potential alongside one or more disabilities (e.g., ADHD, ASD, Dyslexia)",
                "Exceptional athletic ability and exceptional academic performance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "2e children are those who demonstrate high ability in one or more areas while also having a disability, which often leads to their gifts masking their challenges and vice versa."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "In a case study involving severe adolescent risky behavior (e.g., substance use), a Positive Parenting Coach’s first priority is:",

                "Restoring the relationship and establishing safety/harm reduction",
                "Taking away all electronics and grounding the teen for a month",

                "Forcing the teen to apologize to the parents"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Safety and the parent-child connection are the foundations of influence. Without a secure attachment and a focus on harm reduction, external control measures usually fail or increase risk."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "Which 'Red Flag' in a case involving childhood trauma requires an immediate referral to a clinical therapist rather than coaching?",

                "The child prefers to play alone sometimes",
                "The child exhibits signs of dissociation, self-harm, or severe sexualized behavior",
                "The child is struggling to finish their homework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While coaches support parenting strategies, clinical symptoms like dissociation, self-harm, and severe trauma-related behaviors require the expertise of a licensed mental health professional."
