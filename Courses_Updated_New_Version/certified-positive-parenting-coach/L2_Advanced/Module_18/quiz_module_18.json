            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nonlinear synthesis allows a coach to move fluidly between pillars, integrating them based on the family's immediate dynamics rather than following a rigid, step-by-step sequence."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic imbalance occurs when the interaction between a parent and one child creates a ripple effect that destabilizes the relationships or behaviors of other children in the home."

        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to the neurobiological strategies in Lesson 3, what is 'Vertical Integration'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research by Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor shows that the chemical process of an emotion lasts about 90 seconds; after that, the persistence of the emotion is due to the individual's mental loops."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Collectivist cultures value the group and family unit over the individual; therefore, the framework must emphasize how positive parenting benefits the entire family's harmony."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Righting Reflex' is a coaching trap where the practitioner tries to provide solutions too quickly, which often increases the client's resistance and defensiveness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The parallel process occurs when the dynamics between the coach and parent (e.g., trust, authority, empathy) reflect the very dynamics the parent is struggling with in their relationship with their child."

                "The 5-year-old has a biological disorder that the 8-year-old does not have.",
                "The 8-year-old is 'over-functioning' to compensate for the chaos, while the 5-year-old is expressing the system's stress through 'acting out.'",
                "The 5-year-old is simply jealous and needs more punishment.",
                "The 8-year-old has stopped caring about the family dynamics entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In systemic synthesis, children often take on roles (the 'good' child vs. the 'problem' child) to balance the family's emotional tension during transitions like the birth of a sibling."

        {
            "id": "q18_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesized, holistic approaches lead to significantly higher retention because they address the root causes and the entire family system rather than just teaching isolated skills."
