            "question": "In the neurobiology of co-regulation (L1), which branch of the autonomic nervous system must be active in the parent to facilitate the 'Social Engagement System' in the child?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex",
                "The Sympathetic Adrenal-Medullary (SAM) axis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "According to Polyvagal Theory, the Ventral Vagal Complex (the 'smart' vagus) is responsible for the social engagement system, allowing for the facial expressions and vocal prosody necessary for co-regulation."

            "question": "In Advanced Functional Assessment (L2), what is the critical difference between a 'Trigger' and a 'Setting Event'?",
            "options": [
                "Triggers are internal, while setting events are always external.",
                "A trigger immediately precedes the behavior, while a setting event increases vulnerability to the trigger (e.g., lack of sleep).",
                "Setting events are the consequences of the behavior, while triggers are the causes.",
                "There is no functional difference; they are used interchangeably in clinical coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Setting events (or motivating operations) like hunger, fatigue, or illness change the value of a reinforcer and make a child more likely to react to a specific trigger."

            "question": "When utilizing Somatic Coaching (L3), a coach notices a parent's breath becomes shallow and their shoulders rise during a session. Which 'bottom-up' intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the parent to cognitively reframe their child's behavior.",
                "Practicing 'Vagal Toning' through extended exhalations to shift the physiological state.",
                "Discussing the parent's childhood attachment history.",
                "Assigning a written reflection on the parent's values."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic coaching prioritizes 'bottom-up' regulation; physiological interventions like extended exhalations directly stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system to settle the nervous system before cognitive work begins."

            "question": "The Collaborative Problem-Solving (CPS) model (L4) asserts that 'children do well if they can.' This shifts the coach's focus from 'maladaptive behavior' to which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Inconsistent limit setting by the parents",
                "The child's lack of motivation and will",

                "The need for more robust reward systems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CPS, popularized by Dr. Ross Greene, posits that behavior challenges are the result of lagging skills (flexibility, frustration tolerance, problem-solving) rather than a lack of motivation."

                "Using visualization techniques to ignore the child's emotional outbursts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mentalizing, or reflective functioning, is the capacity to understand the mental states (needs, desires, feelings) that motivate one's own behavior and the behavior of others."

                "To determine which punishment will be most effective.",
                "To identify if a behavior is a 'meltdown' (physiological) rather than a 'tantrum' (goal-directed).",
                "To teach the child how to ignore their sensory environment.",
                "To ensure the child meets neurotypical social milestones faster."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding the neurological root allows coaches to distinguish between goal-directed behavior (tantrums) and sensory/emotional overload (meltdowns), which require entirely different responses."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ambivalence is the state of having mixed feelings; the parent expresses both the desire to change ('I know I should') and the reasons to stay the same ('but my kid pushes my buttons')."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "In Systemic Integration (L8), if a coach identifies 'Triangulation' occurring between two co-parents and a child, what is the primary coaching goal?",
            "options": [
                "To help the child choose the more 'positive' parent.",
                "To encourage the child to act as a messenger between the parents.",
                "To strengthen the parental dyad and remove the child from the middle of adult conflict.",
                "To involve a third party, like a grandparent, to balance the triangle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triangulation occurs when a third person (the child) is drawn into a conflict between two others to reduce tension. The goal is to 'detriangulate' by having parents address their issues directly."

            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on Collaborative Problem-Solving (referenced in L4) found that reducing 'Plan A' (imposing adult will) in favor of 'Plan B' (collaborative solutions) resulted in what percentage decrease in physical aggression in residential settings?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Up to 80%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into CPS models (Greene et al.) has shown dramatic reductions—often cited up to 80%—in physical restraint and aggressive outbursts by focusing on collaborative skill-building."

            "question": "In the context of Advanced Motivational Interviewing (L7), which OARS skill is being used when a coach says: 'It sounds like you feel exhausted because you value being a present parent, but your current schedule makes that feel impossible'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is a complex reflection (specifically a double-sided reflection) because it captures both sides of the parent's ambivalence and links their feelings to their underlying values."
