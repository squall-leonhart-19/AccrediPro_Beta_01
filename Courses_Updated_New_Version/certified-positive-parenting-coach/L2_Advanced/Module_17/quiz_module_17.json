            "question": "When applying the NURTURE lens to advanced case conceptualization, what does the 'R' primarily represent to help coaches identify barriers to progress?",

                "Regulatory Capacity",
                "Reward Responsiveness",
                "Resilience Factors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regulatory Capacity refers to the physiological and emotional ability of both the parent and child to manage arousal levels, which is a foundational requirement for any positive parenting strategy to work."

                "Implementing a stricter 'time-out' protocol for non-compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Declarative language (e.g., 'I notice the trash is full' instead of 'Take out the trash') reduces the perceived threat to autonomy that triggers the PDA nervous system."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In trauma-informed coaching, 'Felt Safety' is best described as:",

                "The implementation of a comprehensive home security system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Felt Safety is a neurobiological state (Polyvagal Theory). Even if a child is physically safe, their nervous system may remain in a state of hypervigilance due to past trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel parenting focuses on disengagement to reduce conflict. Coaches help clients focus on their own 'Circle of Control' rather than attempting to change the other parent's behavior."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children ages 3–5 often lack the cognitive concept of 'irreversibility' and may ask when a deceased person is coming back, viewing death as temporary."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD involves a 2-3 year developmental lag in the prefrontal cortex, affecting the brain's ability to organize, prioritize, and sustain effort."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
