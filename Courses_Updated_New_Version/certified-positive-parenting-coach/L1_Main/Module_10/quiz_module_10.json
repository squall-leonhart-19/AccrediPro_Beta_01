            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding provides the 'just right' amount of support to help a child succeed, which is then faded as they develop independent mastery."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A parent notices their 4-year-old is hitting when it's time to clean up toys. Using the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework, the parent first calms themselves, then validates the child's frustration before setting the boundary. Which two steps did they just apply?",

                "Notice & Observe and Reinforce Growth",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
