            "question": "According to the 'Behavior as Communication' philosophy, what is the primary objective of a Positive Parenting Coach when a child exhibits 'maladaptive' behavior?",
            "options": [
                "To implement immediate consequences to stop the behavior",
                "To identify the underlying unmet need or lagging skill driving the behavior",
                "To reward the child for the absence of the behavior",
                "To explain to the child why their behavior is socially unacceptable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The core philosophy treats behavior as the 'smoke' and the unmet need as the 'fire.' Coaches look past the surface action to find the root cause."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the Hierarchy of Childhood Needs, which foundational level must be stabilized before a child can access the 'Executive Functioning' required for logic and cooperation?",
            "options": [
                "Self-Esteem and Competence",
                "Social Belonging",
                "Physiological and Safety Needs",
                "Cognitive Stimulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a child's nervous system detects a lack of safety or physiological stability (hunger, exhaustion), the 'downstairs brain' takes over, making higher-level logic inaccessible."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A 3-year-old struggles to share a toy and has a meltdown. Based on Lesson 3, why is this behavior considered 'age-appropriate' rather than 'defiant'?",
            "options": [
                "The child is intentionally testing the parent's patience",
                "The child has developed an 'oppositional' temperament",
                "The prefrontal cortex, responsible for impulse control and perspective-taking, is significantly under-developed",
                "The child has been over-indulged by the caregivers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Toddlers lack the neurological 'braking system' (prefrontal cortex) required for consistent impulse control; their behavior is a reflection of developmental capacity, not character."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A child who frequently 'crashes' into walls, prefers tight clothing, and struggles with body awareness is likely seeking input for which sensory system?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular",
                "Proprioceptive",
                "Interoceptive",
                "Tactile"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The proprioceptive system processes input from muscles and joints. Children who are 'under-responsive' often seek heavy work or 'crashing' to feel where their body is in space."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "What is the critical distinction between 'Attention-Seeking' and 'Attachment-Seeking' behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Attention-seeking is manipulative, while attachment-seeking is genuine",
                "Attention-seeking is about the quantity of engagement; attachment-seeking is about the quality of felt-safety and connection",
                "Attention-seeking only occurs in toddlers; attachment-seeking occurs in teens",
                "There is no distinction; they are clinical synonyms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attachment-seeking is a biological drive for safety and belonging. While attention is the 'currency,' the underlying need is often a secure emotional bond."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When a child insists on doing a difficult task 'by myself' and reacts with anger when a parent intervenes, which core need is most likely being expressed?",
            "options": [
                "The need for Superiority",
                "The need for Autonomy and Agency",
                "The need for Attention",
                "The need for Sensory Regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autonomy and Agency (Power) are essential needs. Children resist 'power-over' dynamics to assert their own competence and influence over their world."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "The 'Goodness of Fit' model (Chess & Thomas) suggests that behavioral challenges often arise from:",
            "options": [
                "A child's 'difficult' temperament alone",
                "A parent's lack of strict discipline",
                "The mismatch between a child's temperament and the demands of their environment",
                "Genetic predispositions that cannot be altered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Behavioral harmony occurs when the environment and parenting style are adjusted to support the child's unique hardwiring (temperament)."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In the 'Needs Discovery' Coaching Protocol, what occurs during the 'Hypothesis' stage?",
            "options": [
                "The coach tells the parent exactly what is wrong",
                "The coach and parent brainstorm potential unmet needs that align with the observed behavioral patterns",
                "The coach diagnoses the child with a specific sensory processing disorder",
                "The coach creates a reward chart for the child"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hypothesis stage is a collaborative effort to 'guess' the unmet need (e.g., 'Perhaps the bedtime resistance is actually a need for connection after a long day') before testing a strategy."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key indicator that a child is experiencing a 'Sensory Meltdown' rather than a 'Behavioral Tantrum'?",
            "options": [
                "The behavior stops immediately once the child receives a desired object",
                "The child is looking for a reaction from the parent",
                "The behavior continues even when no one is watching and the child appears unable to process sensory input",
                "The child is able to negotiate during the episode"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A meltdown is a neurological 'system overload' where the child has lost control. Unlike a tantrum, it is not goal-directed or dependent on an audience."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Recent neurobiological research suggests the prefrontal cortex—the area responsible for 'Emotional Regulation'—does not reach full maturity until approximately:",
            "options": [
                "12 years of age",
                "18 years of age",
                "25-28 years of age",
                "7 years of age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biological maturity of the prefrontal cortex occurs in the mid-to-late twenties. This statistic is vital for coaches to help parents set realistic expectations for their children's self-regulation."
