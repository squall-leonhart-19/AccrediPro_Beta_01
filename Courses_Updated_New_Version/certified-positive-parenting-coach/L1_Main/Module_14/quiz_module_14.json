            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "What is the fundamental philosophical shift required when implementing the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™?",
            "options": [
                "Shifting from positive reinforcement to negative consequences",
                "Shifting from compliance-based control to relationship-based connection",
                "Shifting from child-led parenting to parent-led authority",
                "Shifting from emotional validation to behavioral modification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The core of the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™ is moving away from external control and compliance toward building a deep, secure connection that drives internal motivation."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Notice & Observe), which of the following is considered an 'objective behavioral observation'?",
            "options": [
                "The child was being defiant and disrespectful during dinner.",
                "The child is clearly seeking attention because they feel left out.",
                "The child raised their voice and pushed their plate 6 inches away.",
                "The child acted out because they were tired from soccer practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective observation focuses on 'camera-verifiable' facts (raised voice, pushed plate) rather than interpretations or labels like 'defiant' or 'seeking attention.'"

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Understand Needs' pillar (L3), misbehavior is most accurately described as:",
            "options": [
                "A coded message communicating an unmet physiological or emotional need",
                "A deliberate attempt to manipulate parental emotions for gain",

                "A temporary neurological malfunction that should be ignored"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The framework teaches that behavior is the 'tip of the iceberg,' serving as a communication tool for underlying needs like safety, belonging, or sensory regulation."

            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the 'Neuroscience of Parental Self-Regulation.' What occurs in the brain during a 'flipped lid' scenario?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex takes over to ensure logical decision-making",

                "The Cerebellum increases fine motor skills for better physical control",
                "The Amygdala triggers a fight-flight-freeze response, bypassing the Prefrontal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A 'flipped lid' (Dan Siegel's hand model) occurs when the emotional brain (amygdala) overwhelms the thinking brain (prefrontal cortex), making calm parenting physiologically impossible until regulated."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "In the 'Teach & Guide' phase (L5), what is the primary distinction between a 'Logical Consequence' and a 'Punishment'?",
            "options": [
                "Punishments are always physical, while consequences are verbal",
                "Logical consequences are related, respectful, and reasonable; punishments are intended to cause suffering",
                "Logical consequences must happen 24 hours later to be effective",
                "There is no distinction; both are used to stop behavior through fear"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Logical consequences focus on learning and restoration (the 3 Rs), whereas punishment focuses on retribution and making the child 'pay' for their mistake."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Repair' process—reconnecting after a rupture—is more important for attachment security than being a 'perfect' parent who never has conflicts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Predictable routines and consistency create a sense of safety, which lowers cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and allows the brain to remain in a learning state."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "To 'Empower Autonomy' (L8), a coach should encourage parents to use 'Scaffolding.' What does this look like in practice?",
            "options": [
                "Doing the task for the child to show them how it's done perfectly",
                "Leaving the child alone to figure it out entirely on their own",
                "Providing the minimum level of support needed for the child to succeed independently",
                "Rewarding the child with stickers every time they attempt a new task"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing temporary support that is gradually removed as the child develops the skill, fostering genuine emotional and functional maturity."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah’s 4-year-old is screaming because she cut the toast into triangles instead of squares. Using the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. sequence, what should Sarah do first?",
            "options": [
                "Explain why triangles are better (Teach)",
                "Notice her own rising heart rate and take a deep breath (Regulate)",

                "Tell the child they are being 'dramatic' (Observe)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The framework requires parental self-regulation (the 'R' in N.U.R.T.U.R.E., though often practiced first) before attempting to engage or teach the child."

            "id": "q14_10",

                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 70%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroscience indicates that 90% of brain development occurs by age five, emphasizing the critical nature of the connection-based interactions taught in the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™."
