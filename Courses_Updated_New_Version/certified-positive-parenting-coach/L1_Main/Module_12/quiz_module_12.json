            "question": "The N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™ is built on the fundamental paradigm shift that behavior is not something to be 'managed,' but rather:",
            "options": [
                "A symptom of poor character that requires immediate correction",
                "A biological reflex that cannot be influenced by parenting",
                "A form of communication signaling an unmet need or lagging skill",
                "A social construct designed to test parental authority"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core of the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™ is viewing behavior as communication, shifting from 'What is this child doing to me?' to 'What is this child's behavior telling me?'"

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In the 'Notice & Observe' phase (N), which of the following is considered an objective observation rather than a subjective interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The child was being manipulative to get a cookie",
                "The child's volume increased to 80 decibels and they threw a plastic block",
                "The child was acting out because they were jealous of their sibling",
                "The child was being lazy during their homework session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Objective observation focuses on sensory data (what you see and hear) without adding labels, motives, or emotional interpretations like 'manipulative' or 'lazy.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Understand Needs' (U) lesson, what is the 'Iceberg Phenomenon' in pediatric behavior?",
            "options": [
                "The idea that 90% of a child's needs are hidden beneath the surface of their observable behavior",
                "The theory that children's emotions should be 'frozen' until they can speak calmly",
                "The belief that behavior becomes more rigid (like ice) as a child gets older",
                "The 10% of behavior that is positive vs. the 90% that is negative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Iceberg Phenomenon illustrates that the observable behavior is only the tip; the vast majority of the 'why' (sensory needs, emotional state, developmental stage) lies beneath the surface."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "During the 'Regulate Responses' (R) phase, what neurobiological mechanism allows a parent's calm state to help soothe a child's dysregulated state?",
            "options": [
                "The Fight-or-Flight response",
                "Synaptic pruning in the occipital lobe",
                "The activation of mirror neurons and the Ventral Vagal circuit",
                "The suppression of the Prefrontal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation occurs when a parent's regulated nervous system activates the child's mirror neurons, signaling safety to the child's Ventral Vagal circuit and calming the Amygdala."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In the 'Teach & Guide' (T) phase, why is punitive discipline (like shaming or physical punishment) considered neurologically counterproductive for learning?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the child too happy to focus on the lesson",
                "High levels of cortisol and adrenaline shut down the Prefrontal Cortex, where learning occurs",
                "It strengthens the connection between the Hippocampus and the Amygdala too quickly",
                "Punishment actually increases IQ, but decreases social skills"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress hormones like cortisol trigger a 'survival state' (downstairs brain), which effectively takes the 'learning brain' (Prefrontal Cortex) offline, making it impossible to integrate new skills."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "The 'Unite through Connection' (U) phase emphasizes 'Connection before Correction.' Which strategy is a primary tool for strengthening the attachment bond?",

                "Using a sticker chart for basic obedience",
                "Special Time: 10-15 minutes of child-led, undivided attention daily",
                "Ignoring the child until they apologize for their behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Special Time is a proactive connection strategy that builds the 'emotional bank account,' making the child more receptive to guidance and reducing attention-seeking behaviors."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "When 'Reinforcing Growth' (R), what is the primary difference between a bribe and a positive reinforcement?",
            "options": [
                "A bribe is offered during the heat of a struggle to stop behavior; reinforcement is a planned acknowledgement of effort",
                "A bribe is always money, while reinforcement is always verbal praise",
                "There is no difference; they are both forms of manipulation",
                "Reinforcement is only used for bad behavior, while bribes are for good behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bribes are reactive 'negotiations' used to stop an active meltdown, whereas reinforcement is a proactive tool used to acknowledge and solidify desired behaviors after they occur."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the 'Empower Autonomy' (E) phase, what does 'scaffolding' refer to in a parenting context?",
            "options": [
                "Building physical structures to keep children safe",
                "Providing temporary support that is gradually removed as the child masters a skill",
                "Creating a rigid schedule that the child must follow without deviation",
                "The process of the parent doing the task for the child to ensure it is done correctly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing the minimum amount of support necessary for a child to succeed at a task, then slowly fading that support as their competence and autonomy grow."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the framework found that children whose parents utilized co-regulation strategies (Step 4) showed a ____ increase in executive function markers compared to those in punitive environments.",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "12%",
                "27%",
                "55%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The framework references data showing a 27% increase in executive function (self-regulation, working memory) when co-regulation is prioritized over punishment."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A coach is working with a parent whose child 'refuses' to clean their room. Using the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. steps, what is the first action the coach should suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Take away the child's electronics until the room is clean",
                "Notice and describe the specific behaviors and environment without judgment",
                "Teach the child how to fold laundry immediately",
                "Reinforce the growth by giving the child a treat before they start"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first step is always 'Notice & Observe.' Before intervening, the parent must objectively see what is happening (e.g., 'The child is sitting on the floor looking at a toy, 40 items are on the ground') to avoid subjective labels like 'refusal' or 'laziness.'"
