            "question": "In the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™, what is the critical first step a parent must take before attempting to 'Teach & Guide' a child during a conflict?",
            "options": [
                "Identify the appropriate natural consequence",
                "Regulate their own internal emotional state",
                "Explain why the behavior was unacceptable",
                "Provide a reward for stopping the behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Regulate' phase (L4) emphasizes that a parent must be the 'Emotional Anchor.' A parent cannot effectively teach or co-regulate a child if they are in a state of dysregulation themselves."

            "question": "Which of the following is a truly 'Objective Observation' as defined in Lesson 2 (Notice & Observe)?",
            "options": [
                "The child was acting aggressively because he was tired.",
                "The child threw the blue block three feet toward the window.",
                "The child was being defiant during the transition to dinner.",
                "The child seemed frustrated by the difficult math homework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Objective assessment avoids labels like 'aggressive' or 'frustrated' and instead focuses on measurable, observable actions (throwing a block, distance, color)."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Iceberg Model' of behavior in Lesson 3, what represents the 90% of the iceberg below the surface?",
            "options": [
                "The actual physical behavior being displayed",
                "The parent's reaction to the child's choices",
                "Unmet needs, lagging skills, and emotional states",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 teaches that behavior is a 'language.' The visible behavior is only the tip; the majority of the issue lies in underlying needs like safety, connection, or sensory processing."

            "options": [
                "A child is most likely to respond to physical punishment",
                "A parent can ignore bad behavior without consequences",
                "The nervous system is balanced and capable of learning",
                "The child has reached their maximum limit of frustration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal arousal zone where the prefrontal cortex remains online, allowing for social engagement and cognitive learning."

            "options": [
                "Logical consequences must be painful to be effective.",
                "Punishment is always physical, while consequences are verbal.",
                "Logical consequences are related, respectful, and reasonable.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Positive discipline (L5) focuses on consequences that are logically related to the behavior, respectful in delivery, and reasonable in scope, whereas punishment is often arbitrary and shame-based."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Connection is built through consistency and child-led play. 10-15 minutes of daily 'Special Time' where the child leads the play is a core strategy for strengthening the attachment bond."

            "options": [
                "It prevents the child from becoming too arrogant.",
                "It fosters a growth mindset and persistence in the face of failure.",
                "It is easier for the parent to think of things to say.",
                "Praising intelligence has been proven to lower IQ over time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (Dweck et al.) shows that praising the process/effort (Reinforce) encourages children to take risks and view challenges as opportunities to grow, rather than tests of their worth."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8 (Empower Autonomy), what does the term 'Scaffolding' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Building a physical structure to keep children safe",
                "Providing temporary support that is gradually removed as the child gains mastery",
                "The strict hierarchy of the parent-child relationship",
                "A method of time-outs used for older children"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding is an empowerment technique where the coach/parent provides just enough support for the child to succeed, then fades that support as the child's competence increases."

            "question": "A child refuses to clean their room. A coach using the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™ would first ask the parent to 'Understand' (L3) the behavior by:",
            "options": [
                "Asking: 'What is the function of this refusal? Is it a lagging skill or an unmet need?'",
                "Asking: 'What is the most effective punishment to make them comply?'",
                "Asking: 'How can we reward them with screen time for cleaning?'",
                "Asking: 'Why is the child being so disrespectful to your authority?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Understand' phase is about decoding the behavior. The coach helps the parent look for the 'Why' (e.g., executive function struggle or a need for autonomy) before jumping to solutions."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "According to research on behavioral reinforcement (L7), which schedule of reinforcement leads to the most 'extinction-resistant' (long-lasting) behaviors?",
            "options": [
                "Continuous Reinforcement (rewarding every single time)",
                "No Reinforcement (letting the child figure it out)",
                "Intermittent/Variable Reinforcement (rewarding occasionally and unpredictably)",
                "Negative Reinforcement (removing a chore when they behave)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful way to solidify a habit because the child continues the behavior in anticipation of a potential (but not guaranteed) reinforcement."
