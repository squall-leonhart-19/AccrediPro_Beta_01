            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Basal Ganglia",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the Prefrontal Cortex handles the initial conscious effort, the Basal Ganglia is the 'habit center' that manages automaticity and routine execution."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Encouragement focuses on the process, effort, and strategy rather than innate traits, fostering a growth mindset."

            "options": [
                "A schedule is more fun, while a rhythm is strict.",
                "A schedule is time-bound (8:00 AM), while a rhythm is sequence-bound (After X comes Y).",
                "A rhythm requires a visual timer, while a schedule does not.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rhythms focus on the predictable flow and sequence of events, which reduces transition anxiety more effectively than rigid time-stamps for many children."

                "It is a requirement for the ASI certification.",
                "It ensures the child sees the parent as a peer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency is the 'fuel' of reinforcement; parents who lack self-compassion often experience shame spirals that lead to inconsistent parenting."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "New habits often feel 'mechanical' at first. Coaches must normalize the transition period where the behavior is conscious before it becomes an authentic part of the parent's identity."
