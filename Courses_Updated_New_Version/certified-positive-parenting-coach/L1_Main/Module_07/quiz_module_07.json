            "question": "According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT) discussed in Lesson 1, what are the three innate psychological needs required for optimal human functioning and intrinsic motivation?",
            "options": [
                "Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness",
                "Compliance, Achievement, and Affiliation",
                "Independence, Success, and Social Status",
                "Self-Esteem, Safety, and Self-Actualization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Self-Determination Theory, developed by Deci and Ryan, identifies Autonomy (feeling in control), Competence (feeling capable), and Relatedness (feeling connected) as the three pillars of internal motivation."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Zone of Proximal Development' (ZPD) is defined as the gap between what a child can do alone and what they can do with help. What is the primary goal of 'scaffolding' within this zone?",
            "options": [
                "To do the task for the child to ensure it is done correctly",
                "To provide temporary support that is gradually removed as the child gains mastery",
                "To set goals that are significantly beyond the child's current reach to encourage grit",
                "To offer rewards for every successful step taken toward a goal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing the minimum necessary support to help a child succeed, then 'fading' that support as the child develops the skills to perform the task independently."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "When using Collaborative Problem-Solving (CPS) as taught in Lesson 3, what is the 'Empathy Step' primarily designed to achieve?",
            "options": [
                "To explain the parent's concerns to the child",
                "To negotiate a quick compromise that ends the conflict",
                "To gather information and understand the child's perspective on the specific 'lagging skill' or problem",
                "To tell the child that you understand they are being difficult"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Empathy Step is the first stage of CPS, where the parent listens without judgment to truly understand the child's concern before moving to the 'Define the Problem' or 'Invitation' steps."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'The Architecture of Choice.' When a child is experiencing 'choice paralysis' or 'overchoice,' what is the most effective coaching strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Remove all choices and make the decision for them",
                "Increase the number of options to ensure they find one they like",
                "Offer 'Closed-Ended Choices' by limiting the selection to two acceptable options",
                "Wait until the child eventually makes a decision, regardless of how long it takes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reducing options to a binary choice (e.g., 'Do you want the blue shirt or the red shirt?') reduces cognitive load and empowers the child to make a decision without feeling overwhelmed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, which of the following is an example of a 'Natural Consequence' rather than a 'Logical Consequence'?",

                "A child is required to clean up the juice they intentionally spilled"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Natural consequences happen without adult intervention as a direct result of the child's action (or inaction). Feeling cold is the natural result of not wearing a jacket."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In the context of Growth Mindset (Lesson 6), which type of praise has been shown in research (e.g., Carol Dweck) to increase a child's persistence and desire for challenges?",
            "options": [
                "Person Praise (e.g., 'You are so smart!')",
                "Outcome Praise (e.g., 'I'm so glad you got an A!')",
                "Process Praise (e.g., 'I noticed how hard you worked to solve that problem!')",
                "Comparative Praise (e.g., 'You did better than everyone else in the class!')"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Process praise focuses on effort, strategy, and perseverance, which fosters a growth mindset and encourages children to view challenges as opportunities for learning."

            "question": "Lesson 7 highlights that household contributions (chores) are vital for 'Functional Independence.' What is a key coaching recommendation for introducing these tasks?",

                "Pay the child a market-rate wage for every task completed",
                "Frame chores as 'Household Contributions' that are part of being a team member",
                "Assign the most difficult tasks first to build character",
                "Only assign tasks the child enjoys doing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Framing tasks as 'contributions' to the family team builds a sense of belonging and competence, whereas paying for chores can shift motivation from intrinsic to extrinsic."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "As a parent shifts from 'Manager' to 'Consultant' (Lesson 8), how should they primarily offer advice to an older child or adolescent?",

                "By giving unsolicited advice whenever they see the child making a mistake",
                "By stepping back entirely and never offering input",
                "By asking permission to share a perspective (e.g., 'Would you like to hear my thoughts on that?')",
                "By using 'I told you so' when the child's plan fails"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Consultant role involves waiting for an invitation or asking permission to provide input, which respects the child's growing autonomy and makes them more likely to actually listen."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that high levels of 'Parental Psychological Control' are most strongly correlated with which outcome in children?",

                "Better athletic performance due to discipline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychological control (guilt-tripping, withdrawing love, or invalidating feelings) undermines autonomy and is a significant risk factor for anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem."

                "Invite the child to accept the parent's solution",
                "Invite the child to brainstorm solutions that address both the child's and the parent's concerns",
                "Invite the child to take a 'time out' to think about what they did",
                "Invite the child to choose which consequence they would prefer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Invitation is a collaborative call to action where both parties work together to find a 'Plan B' solution that is mutually satisfactory and realistic."
