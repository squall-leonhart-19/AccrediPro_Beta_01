        {
            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "In the NURTURE Framework™, the final pillar 'Empowerment' is defined as moving the parental role from a 'Manager' to which of the following?",
            "options": ["Disciplinarian", "Consultant", "Peer", "Observer"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Empowerment pillar focuses on shifting the parental dynamic from a top-down management style to a 'Consultant' role, where the parent provides guidance while allowing the child to lead their own decision-making process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to the Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) model discussed in Lesson 2, what is the primary goal of the 'Invitation' step?",
            "options": ["To set a firm consequence if the behavior continues", "To explain why the parent's concern is more valid than the child's", "To brainstorm solutions together that address both the child's and parent's concerns", "To give the child a choice between two pre-determined options"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Invitation step is the third phase of CPS where the parent and child collaborate to find a solution that is mutually satisfactory, fostering autonomy and problem-solving skills."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Research by Mueller and Dweck (cited in Lesson 3) demonstrated that children praised for their 'intelligence' rather than their 'effort' were more likely to:",
            "options": ["Persist longer on difficult tasks", "Choose easier tasks to avoid the risk of failure", "Develop higher long-term IQ scores", "Experience increased self-efficacy in new environments"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that praising innate intelligence fosters a fixed mindset, leading children to avoid challenges that might jeopardize their 'smart' status, whereas praising effort fosters a growth mindset."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "During the 'Adolescent' stage of autonomy (Lesson 4), what neurological process makes risk-taking more common while executive function is still developing?",
            "options": ["Prefrontal cortex over-activity", "Early maturation of the limbic system relative to the prefrontal cortex", "Decreased dopamine production", "Complete myelination of the corpus callosum"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In adolescence, the emotional/reward center (limbic system) matures earlier than the impulse control center (prefrontal cortex), creating a 'developmental gap' that coaches must help parents navigate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "A parent who consistently uses 'we' to describe a child's individual grades or sports performance (e.g., 'We got an A in Chemistry') is likely demonstrating which concept from Lesson 7?",
            "options": ["Empathetic Mirroring", "Enmeshment", "Secure Attachment", "Authoritative Scaffolding"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Enmeshment occurs when the boundaries between parent and child become blurred, often leading the parent to view the child's successes or failures as their own, which hinders the child's autonomy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a core component of fostering an 'Internal Locus of Control' in children as discussed in Lesson 5?",
            "options": ["Using external rewards like sticker charts for every task", "Allowing children to experience natural consequences of their choices", "Protecting children from all negative emotions to maintain confidence", "Ensuring the child follows a strict schedule dictated by the parent"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An internal locus of control is developed when children see a direct correlation between their actions and outcomes, which is best facilitated through experiencing natural consequences."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "When coaching a parent through the 'Letting Go' process (Lesson 6), what is the 'Safety Net' strategy?",
            "options": ["Removing all rules to see if the child can self-regulate", "Identifying low-stakes areas where the child can fail safely to learn", "Increasing surveillance to ensure the child doesn't make mistakes", "Creating a contract where the parent makes all final decisions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Safety Net' involves identifying 'low-stakes' opportunities for autonomy where the cost of failure is manageable, allowing the child to build competence without catastrophic results."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Leo' (Lesson 2), who struggled with morning routines, the successful intervention involved:",
            "options": ["A stricter punishment for being late to school", "A reward system involving screen time", "Asking Leo for his ideas on how to solve the 'morning rush' problem", "The parent waking Leo up 30 minutes earlier"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By using Collaborative Problem Solving and asking for Leo's input, the parent shifted from a power struggle to a partnership, which increased Leo's investment in the solution."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes that 'Sustainability' in the NURTURE framework is achieved when the parent:",
            "options": ["No longer needs to use any of the framework tools", "Becomes the primary problem-solver for the child's life", "Integrates the mindset of 'connection before correction' into daily intuition", "Strictly follows the 7-step protocol without variation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is reached when the core principles—specifically prioritizing connection and autonomy—become a natural, intuitive part of the parenting style rather than a forced checklist."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Scaffolding' technique in the context of fostering independence (Lesson 2)?",
            "options": ["Building a rigid structure that the child cannot change", "Providing the minimum amount of support necessary for a child to succeed at a task", "Doing the task for the child first, then letting them try it once", "Setting high expectations without providing any resources"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing just enough support to help the child reach the next level of competence, then gradually withdrawing that support as the child's skill increases."
