            "question": "In the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™, what is the primary objective of the first stage, 'Notice & Observe'?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately stop the child's unwanted behavior",
                "To collect objective data and separate facts from emotional interpretations",
                "To explain to the child why their behavior is inappropriate",
                "To determine which punishment is most appropriate for the situation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Notice & Observe focuses on objective assessment, removing labels like 'naughty' or 'defiant' to see the physiological and environmental triggers clearly."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 (Understand Needs), behavior is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "A conscious attempt to manipulate parental emotions",
                "A personality trait that is fixed from birth",
                "The 'tip of the iceberg' representing underlying unmet needs or lagging skills",
                "A reflection of the parent's failure to set strict enough boundaries"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Behavioral communication suggests that outward actions are merely symptoms of internal states, such as hunger, fatigue, or a need for connection."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the '90-Second Rule' regarding parental self-regulation. What does this rule scientifically imply?",
            "options": [
                "A child should be given 90 seconds to comply before a consequence is issued",
                "The physiological lifespan of an emotion's chemical flush in the body is roughly 90 seconds",
                "Parents should wait 90 seconds before hugging a child after a tantrum",
                "Deep breathing exercises must last exactly 90 seconds to be effective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor’s research shows that the chemical process of an emotion lasts 90 seconds; after that, it is our thoughts that keep the emotion alive."

            "options": [
                "Positive discipline is only for older children, while punishment is for toddlers",
                "Punishment focuses on making the child suffer for the past; Discipline focuses on teaching skills for the future",
                "Positive discipline allows the child to do whatever they want without boundaries",
                "Punishment is more effective for long-term brain development and character building"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Discipline comes from the word 'disciple' (to teach), focusing on proactive skill-building rather than reactive retribution."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Lesson 6 (Unite through Connection) emphasizes 'Connection before Correction.' Why is this biologically necessary for the child?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the child feel guilty enough to change their behavior",
                "It ensures the child's prefrontal cortex is online and receptive to learning",
                "It prevents the child from ever feeling upset or angry",
                "It allows the parent to avoid the 'Regulate' phase of the framework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a child feels disconnected or threatened, their 'downstairs brain' (amygdala) takes over. Connection calms the nervous system, allowing the 'upstairs brain' to engage."

            "options": [
                "Person Praise (e.g., 'You are such a smart boy!')",
                "Generic Praise (e.g., 'Good job!')",
                "Process Praise (e.g., 'I noticed how hard you worked on that puzzle even when it was tricky.')",
                "Outcome Praise (e.g., 'I'm so glad you got an A on that test.')"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Process praise focuses on the effort, strategy, and persistence, which encourages children to embrace challenges rather than fear failure."

                "Building a physical structure to keep children safe in the home",
                "Providing the minimum amount of support necessary for a child to achieve a task independently",
                "Doing the task for the child to show them the 'perfect' way to do it",
                "Removing all rules so the child can learn through total trial and error"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves adjusting the level of support as the child gains competence, eventually fading the support as they master the skill."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A parent reports that their child 'refuses to listen' during morning routines. Using 'Understand Needs' (L3), what should a coach investigate first?",
            "options": [
                "The child's level of defiance and how to increase punishments",
                "The child's physiological state and whether the routine matches their developmental capabilities",
                "Which reward chart will most effectively force the child to comply",
                "The parent's authority level and how to re-assert dominance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before assuming defiance, we must look for 'lagging skills' or 'unmet needs' (e.g., lack of sleep, poor transition support, or executive function gaps)."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "According to the module data, what percentage of behavioral issues are estimated to be resolved through 'Regulate' and 'Unite' before even reaching 'Teach'?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Approximately 70-80%",
                "Behavioral issues cannot be resolved without the 'Teach' phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The framework suggests that 70-80% of 'misbehavior' is actually dysregulation; once the child is regulated and connected, the behavior often self-corrects."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "In a Case Study from L2, a parent describes their child as 'aggressive.' How would a N.U.R.T.U.R.E. coach reframe this during the 'Notice' phase?",
            "options": [
                "The child is 'spirited' and needs more outlets for energy",
                "The child 'used their hands to push a peer when the peer took their toy'",
                "The child has 'conduct disorder' and needs a clinical referral",
                "The child is 'seeking attention' and should be ignored"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing involves replacing subjective labels ('aggressive') with objective, observable actions ('pushed a peer') to identify the specific trigger (toy being taken)."
