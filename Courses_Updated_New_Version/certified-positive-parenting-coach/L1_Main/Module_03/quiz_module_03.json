            "question": "When a parent experiences an 'amygdala hijack' during a conflict with their child, which physiological process is occurring?",
            "options": [
                "The prefrontal cortex loses its 'top-down' inhibitory control over the emotional centers.",
                "The hippocampus increases memory storage to record the event for later learning.",
                "The parasympathetic nervous system immediately floods the body with acetylcholine.",
                "The 'social engagement system' becomes hyper-active to resolve the conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "During an amygdala hijack, the emotional brain takes over, effectively 'taking offline' the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for logic, reasoning, and impulse control."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'bottom-up' somatic warning sign that a parent is moving toward a state of dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden tightening in the chest or a clenching of the jaw.",
                "Thinking, 'He is doing this just to annoy me.'",
                "Deciding that the child needs a 'time-out' immediately.",
                "Worrying about what the neighbors think of the noise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic warning signs are physical sensations (bottom-up) like muscle tension or heart rate increases, whereas thoughts and judgments are top-down processes."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "The 'Sacred Pause' technique is designed to leverage the space between stimulus and response. What is the primary goal of this pause?",
            "options": [
                "To choose a response based on values rather than reacting based on habit.",
                "To ignore the child until they stop their behavior.",
                "To give the parent time to come up with a more severe punishment.",
                "To wait for the child to apologize first."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Sacred Pause allows the nervous system to settle enough for the prefrontal cortex to re-engage, allowing the parent to choose a response aligned with their long-term parenting goals."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the concept of 'Co-Regulation,' how does a parent act as a 'Safe Container' for a child's big emotions?",
            "options": [
                "By remaining physiologically regulated while the child is dysregulated.",
                "By putting the child in a literal container or 'calm down' room.",
                "By suppressing their own emotions so the child never sees them upset.",
                "By explaining logically why the child's feelings are not valid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Being a 'Safe Container' means the parent provides a calm, regulated presence that the child's nervous system can 'borrow' to find its way back to equilibrium."

            "id": "q3_5",

            "options": [
                "Exhaling for twice as long as the inhalation (e.g., 4-count in, 8-count out).",
                "Taking short, rapid breaths into the upper chest.",
                "Tensing all muscles in the body and holding the breath.",
                "Focusing intensely on the child's misbehavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Prolonged exhalation signals to the brain that the body is safe, stimulating the vagus nerve and slowing the heart rate."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A coach is helping a client with 'Cognitive Reframing.' The client says, 'My daughter is so manipulative.' What is the most effective reframe for this parent?",
            "options": [
                "'My daughter is struggling to meet a need and lacks the skills to express it safely.'",
                "'My daughter is just being a typical kid and I should ignore it.'",
                "'My daughter is trying to see how much she can get away with.'",
                "'I am a bad parent for letting her manipulate me.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reframing 'manipulation' as 'unmet needs or missing skills' shifts the parent from a defensive, reactive stance to a collaborative, problem-solving stance."

            "options": [
                "Taking 100% responsibility for the reaction without blaming the child's behavior.",
                "Saying 'I'm sorry I yelled, but you shouldn't have hit your brother.'",
                "Waiting at least 24 hours so the child 'learns their lesson' first.",
                "Apologizing only if the child agrees to change their behavior in exchange."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A true repair requires the parent to own their dysregulation completely. Adding a 'but' or blaming the child's behavior invalidates the apology and prevents true reconnection."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "What does research on 'Mirror Neurons' suggest about the relationship between a parent and child?",
            "options": [
                "A child's nervous system will often mimic the physiological state of the parent.",
                "Children cannot feel a parent's stress unless the parent speaks crossly.",
                "Mirror neurons only function during the first two years of life.",
                "Parents should mirror the child's anger to show they understand."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow the child to subconsciously 'pick up' and mirror the parent's internal state. If the parent is calm, it helps the child become calm; if the parent is anxious, the child’s anxiety increases."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "In the 'Sustainable Regulation Plan,' why is 'proactive regulation' (e.g., sleep, hydration, movement) considered essential?",
            "options": [
                "It widens the parent's 'Window of Tolerance,' making them less reactive to daily stressors.",
                "It ensures that the parent will never feel anger again.",
                "It is a form of 'self-care' that is optional if the parent has enough time.",
                "It is only necessary for parents with clinical anxiety or depression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Proactive regulation builds 'resilience capital,' widening the Window of Tolerance so that small triggers don't immediately push the parent into a fight-or-flight response."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Mark finds himself yelling at his son every evening during homework. He identifies his trigger as 'feeling incompetent' when he can't explain math. What is the recommended 'Regulation' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Acknowledge the feeling of incompetence, take 3 deep breaths, and use a 'mantra' like 'I am safe, this is not an emergency.'",
                "Stop helping with homework entirely to avoid the trigger.",
                "Tell the son that he needs to work harder so Mark doesn't get frustrated.",
                "Force himself to stay in the room and keep yelling until the homework is finished."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The intervention involves identifying the somatic/emotional trigger, using a physical reset (breathing), and a cognitive reframe (mantra) to stay within the Window of Tolerance."
