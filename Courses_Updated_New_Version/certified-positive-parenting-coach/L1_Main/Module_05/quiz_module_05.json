            "question": "Which neurochemical is primarily responsible for the 'bonding' effect during physical touch and is often referred to as the 'social glue' of human connection?",
            "options": ["Cortisol", "Oxytocin", "Adrenaline", "Glutamate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is the primary hormone associated with social bonding, trust, and connection, released during skin-to-skin contact and warm interactions."

            "question": "According to the research of Dr. Ed Tronick, 'good enough' parents are typically 'in sync' with their children what percentage of the time?",
            "options": ["Approximately 100%", "Between 70% and 90%", "Approximately 30% to 50%", "Less than 10%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tronick's research shows that even the most attuned parents are only in sync about 30-50% of the time; the health of the relationship depends on the repair of the frequent ruptures."

            "question": "In the context of 'Intentional Presence,' which of the following is a requirement for a successful 'Special Time' session?",
            "options": ["The parent chooses the activity to ensure it is educational.", "The session must last at least 60 minutes to be effective.", "The parent eliminates all distractions and follows the child's lead.", "The parent uses the time to correct the child's behavior from earlier in the day."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Special Time is characterized by being child-led, distraction-free, and focused entirely on connection rather than instruction or correction."

            "question": "What is the primary function of 'Mirror Neurons' in the architecture of empathy?",
            "options": ["They allow us to reflect on our own past mistakes.", "They fire both when we perform an action and when we observe someone else performing it, facilitating emotional resonance.", "They regulate the circadian rhythm to ensure children get enough sleep.", "They act as a barrier to prevent us from feeling too much of another person's pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons are a biological foundation for empathy, allowing the brain to 'mirror' the actions and emotions observed in others."

            "question": "A parent says: 'I can see you are really angry that we have to leave the park. It’s hard to stop playing when you’re having fun.' This is an example of:",
            "options": ["Permissive parenting", "Emotional validation", "Distraction technique", "Logical consequences"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This is emotional validation, which acknowledges and names the child's internal experience without necessarily changing the boundary (leaving the park)."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When a 'rupture' occurs in the parent-child relationship, what is the most important element of an effective 'repair'?",
            "options": ["The child apologizing for their part first.", "The parent taking full responsibility for their own dysregulation.", "Giving the child a 'time-out' to think about what happened.", "Ignoring the incident so the family can move on quickly."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective repair requires the adult to take ownership of their behavior and emotional state to restore the sense of safety in the relationship."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "For a neurodivergent child who experiences 'sensory overload,' which connection strategy is often more effective than direct, face-to-face emotional processing?",
            "options": ["Forced eye contact to ensure they are listening.", "Parallel play or 'side-by-side' connection.", "Increasing the volume of the parent's voice to command attention.", "Extended periods of social isolation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many neurodivergent children find side-by-side connection (parallel play) less threatening and more regulated than intense, face-to-face interaction."

            "options": ["Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)", "Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Shutdown)", "Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)", "The Limbic System"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the physiological 'home' for connection, characterized by feelings of safety, openness, and social engagement."

            "options": ["A lack of respect that must be punished.", "A manipulation tactic to get their way.", "An SOS signal indicating an unmet need or lack of skills.", "A sign that the parent has been too soft."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Connection Mindset shifts the perspective from 'winning' the struggle to understanding the underlying need or skill deficit driving the behavior."

            "question": "Why is 'Playfulness' specifically effective for de-escalating minor conflicts?",
            "options": ["It confuses the child so they forget why they were upset.", "It lowers the 'affective filter' and reduces the threat response in the brain.", "It proves the parent is 'the boss' by making fun of the situation.", "It is only effective for children under the age of 3."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Playfulness triggers the release of dopamine and switches the brain from a defensive/threat state to a state of safety and receptivity."
