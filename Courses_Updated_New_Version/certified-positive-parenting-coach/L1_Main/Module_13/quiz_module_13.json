        {
            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "According to Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory, which state is characterized by the 'Social Engagement System' being active, allowing for eye contact, facial expression, and vocal prosody?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal State", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Dorsal Vagal State", "The Limbic Hijack"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' state where the social engagement system is active, allowing for connection and co-regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A parent remains calm and breathes deeply while their child is having a meltdown. The child gradually calms down as their brain 'matches' the parent's physiological state. This process is primarily driven by:",
            "options": ["Executive Functioning", "Mirror Neurons and Co-regulation", "Negative Reinforcement", "Sensory Integration"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow the child to perceive and internalize the parent's calm state, facilitating co-regulation through physiological mirroring."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In Dan Siegel’s 'Hand Model of the Brain,' what happens when a person 'flips their lid'?",
            "options": ["The Brainstem takes over the Midbrain", "The Amygdala shuts down to protect the brain", "The Prefrontal Cortex loses its connection with the lower brain structures", "Dopamine floods the Prefrontal Cortex"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flipping the lid refers to the Prefrontal Cortex (the 'lid') losing its regulatory control over the limbic system (the 'thumb'), leading to emotional reactivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter is responsible for inhibiting the amygdala's fear response and is released during skin-to-skin contact, hugging, and positive social bonding?",
            "options": ["Cortisol", "Dopamine", "Oxytocin", "Adrenaline"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, often called the 'bonding hormone,' acts as a powerful buffer against stress by downregulating the amygdala's threat response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "A child who becomes physically aggressive or 'melts down' specifically in loud, crowded environments like grocery stores is likely exhibiting a behavioral antecedent related to:",
            "options": ["Sensory over-responsivity (Hypersensitivity)", "Sensory seeking behavior", "Lack of discipline and boundaries", "Dorsal Vagal collapse"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensory over-responsivity occurs when the brain perceives normal sensory input as threatening, triggering a fight-or-flight response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Based on the concept of Neuroplasticity and Hebbian Theory, how are new behavioral patterns established in the parent-child relationship?",
            "options": ["Through a single high-intensity emotional event", "Through repeated, consistent experiences ('neurons that fire together, wire together')", "By suppressing the amygdala through willpower", "By waiting for the child's brain to mature naturally"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is driven by repetition. Consistently practicing positive parenting 'wires' those neural pathways, making them the brain's default response over time."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Research on toxic stress shows that chronic exposure to high levels of cortisol can lead to structural changes in which part of the brain responsible for memory and emotional regulation?",
            "options": ["The Cerebellum", "The Hippocampus", "The Occipital Lobe", "The Thalamus"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hippocampus is highly sensitive to cortisol; chronic stress can inhibit neurogenesis and reduce the volume of this structure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Which set of skills falls under 'Executive Function,' which coaches help parents support through the process of 'scaffolding'?",
            "options": ["Involuntary reflexes and heart rate regulation", "Working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility", "Visual processing and auditory perception", "Gross motor skills and balance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Executive functions are the 'air traffic control' system of the brain, including working memory, impulse control, and the ability to shift focus."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Leo (5) becomes completely unresponsive, goes limp, and stares blankly after being yelled at. According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the nervous system has been activated?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal (Social)", "Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)", "Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Faint)", "Enteric Nervous System"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leo is demonstrating a 'shutdown' response, which is a Dorsal Vagal immobilization state used by the body when it perceives a threat as inescapable."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "At approximately what age does the Prefrontal Cortex—the area responsible for impulse control and rational thought—typically reach full maturity?",
            "options": ["Age 7", "Age 13", "Age 18", "Mid-20s (approx. 25)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Prefrontal Cortex is the last part of the brain to develop, typically not reaching full maturity until the mid-20s."
