            "explanation": "Objective observation focuses only on observable actions (hitting the table) rather than internal states or motivations (aggression, frustration, intention)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Notice' phase is about objective data gathering and establishing a baseline so that interventions are based on reality rather than bias."
