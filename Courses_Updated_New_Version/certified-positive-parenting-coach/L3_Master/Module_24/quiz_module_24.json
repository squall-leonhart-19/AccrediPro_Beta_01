            "question": "In Advanced Case Conceptualization, what is the primary difference between 'Linear Causality' and 'Circular Causality' within a family system?",
            "options": [
                "Linear causality looks for a single cause-effect root, while circular causality views behavior as a recursive loop where each member influences the other.",
                "Linear causality is used for behavioral issues, while circular causality is only for emotional trauma.",
                "Circular causality focuses on the child's past, whereas linear causality focuses on the present moment.",
                "There is no functional difference; both terms describe the same method of tracking antecedents."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners use a systemic lens to see circular causality, recognizing that a parent's reaction is both a response to and a trigger for the child's behavior, creating a continuous feedback loop."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "A parent describes feeling 'numb, hopeless, and physically heavy' when their child has a meltdown. According to Polyvagal Theory, which state is the parent likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Mobilization (Fight/Flight)",
                "Ventral Vagal Stabilization (Social Engagement)",
                "Dorsal Vagal Immobilization (Shutdown)",
                "Hyper-Attunement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and a sense of hopelessness or 'faint' response when the nervous system perceives an overwhelming threat it cannot escape."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark of 'Guided Discovery' in Socratic Questioning?",
            "options": [
                "Asking leading questions to ensure the client arrives at the coach's specific conclusion.",
                "Providing the parent with a list of 10 solutions and asking them to pick one.",
                "Using open-ended questions that allow the parent to examine their own evidence and reach their own insights.",
                "Correcting the parent's cognitive distortions immediately after they speak."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Socratic questioning aims for guided discovery, where the coach uses structured inquiry to help the client uncover their own beliefs and potential solutions, increasing buy-in and self-efficacy."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "When a parent displays 'Resistance' by saying, 'I've tried every positive parenting tool and nothing works with my child,' how should a Master Practitioner interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "The parent is being difficult and unmotivated.",
                "The parent is experiencing ambivalence or a protective defense mechanism due to perceived lack of safety.",
                "The coach should immediately provide a more complex behavioral plan.",
                "The parent is likely lying about their consistency with the tools."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance is often a form of 'self-protection' or ambivalence. Master practitioners view it as data about the client's internal state rather than a personal affront or a lack of motivation."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In Advanced Behavioral Analysis, if a child's behavior consistently results in the parent stopping a non-preferred task (like chores), the function of that behavior is likely:",

                "Tangible Acquisition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The four functions of behavior are SEAT (Sensory, Escape, Attention, Tangible). If the behavior results in the removal of a demand, the function is escape or avoidance."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "Research on 'Micro-Moments' and attachment (e.g., Tronick's Still Face Experiment) suggests that secure attachment is primarily built through:",

                "100% perfect attunement where the parent never makes a mistake.",

                "Strict adherence to a specific behavioral reward schedule."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners know that 'Repair' is the engine of intimacy. Studies show that even in secure attachments, parents are 'out of sync' about 70% of the time; it is the repair of those ruptures that builds resilience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Safety is the foundation of the trauma-informed approach. Without a felt sense of safety, the nervous system remains in a state of survival, making behavioral change and learning nearly impossible."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches do not diagnose or treat mental health disorders. If a client presents with clinical depression, the coach must refer them to a licensed mental health professional."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coined by Dr. Stephen Porges, neuroception is the 'below-conscious' process by which our neural circuits evaluate risk and safety from the environment, others' faces, and internal cues."

            "id": "q24_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Homeostasis is the tendency of a system to maintain stability. In family coaching, this explains why families may unconsciously sabotage progress to return to a familiar, albeit painful, way of interacting."
