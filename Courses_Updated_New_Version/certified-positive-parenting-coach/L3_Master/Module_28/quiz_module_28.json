            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In any crisis intervention, the absolute first priority is the assessment of lethality and safety to ensure no immediate harm is imminent before proceeding to psychological support."

                "25 times more likely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that an ACE score of 4 or higher correlates with a 1,220% increase in attempted suicide (roughly 12 times the risk)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Declarative language (e.g., 'I wonder if...') reduces the perception of a 'demand' which triggers the threat response in PDA profiles, unlike imperative language (e.g., 'Do your homework now')."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "explanation": "The 'Stance of No Demand' is a tactical de-escalation tool where the adult removes all pressure to allow the child's nervous system to return to a baseline of safety."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Effective repair requires the parent to take full responsibility for their dysregulation and offer 'Being With' (emotional presence) to help the child organize their feelings."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mandated reporters are legally required to report a 'reasonable suspicion' of abuse; they are not required (and should not attempt) to investigate or prove the abuse themselves."

                "A meltdown is a choice to get a specific reward",
                "A tantrum usually stops when the child gets what they want; a meltdown does not",
                "Meltdowns only happen in public; tantrums happen at home",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
