        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™, the first step 'Notice & Observe' specifically requires the coach to help the parent distinguish between which two factors?",
            "options": [
                "The child's intent and the parent's reaction",
                "Objective behavioral antecedents and subjective emotional interpretations",
                "Immediate consequences and long-term developmental goals",
                "Biological temperament and environmental triggers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Notice & Observe focuses on objective assessment. It requires stripping away the parent's 'story' or interpretation of the behavior (e.g., 'he's doing this to spite me') and focusing on the actual observable antecedents and environmental factors."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of parenting (Module 13), what is the primary function of 'co-regulation' during a child's emotional dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress the child's amygdala response through authoritative commands",
                "To activate the parent's sympathetic nervous system to match the child's energy",
                "To utilize the parent's mature prefrontal cortex to help stabilize the child's autonomic nervous system",
                "To distract the child from the emotional trigger using cognitive behavioral techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation is a neurobiological process where the parent uses their own regulated state (prefrontal cortex activity) to provide a 'calm' signal to the child's dysregulated brain, eventually helping the child develop self-regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During the 'Understand Needs' phase, a coach identifies that a child's 'attention-seeking' behavior is actually 'attachment-seeking.' This shift is based on which developmental principle?",
            "options": [
                "Operant Conditioning",
                "Social Learning Theory",
                "The Hierarchy of Needs (Maslow)",
                "Attachment Theory (Bowlby/Ainsworth)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In Positive Parenting, we view behavior as communication. Shifting from 'attention-seeking' (negative connotation) to 'attachment-seeking' (legitimate need) aligns with Attachment Theory, recognizing the biological drive for proximity to a caregiver."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "In 'Regulate Responses' (Module 3), what is the 'Window of Tolerance' and why is it critical for the parent?",
            "options": [
                "The amount of time a parent can ignore a behavior before intervening",
                "The zone of arousal where a parent can remain calm and respond effectively rather than reacting",
                "The specific age range where a child is most receptive to positive discipline",
                "The gap between a child's behavior and the parent's chosen consequence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is a concept from Dan Siegel and Pat Ogden describing the optimal zone of arousal where a person can process information and respond rationally. Staying within this window is the goal of 'Regulate Responses'."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "When implementing 'Teach & Guide', the N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Framework™ prioritizes 'Natural Consequences' over 'Punitive Sanctions.' What is the defining characteristic of a logical consequence?",
            "options": [
                "It is designed to make the child feel regret for their actions",
                "It is unrelated to the behavior but serves as a deterrent",
                "It is Related, Respectful, Reasonable, and Helpful (The 4 R's)",
                "It is administered with a firm, stern tone to ensure compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Logical consequences must be Related to the behavior, Respectful in delivery, Reasonable in scope, and Helpful for future learning. This distinguishes them from punishment, which is often arbitrary and shame-based."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "In 'Unite through Connection' (Module 5), which technique is most effective for building 'Special Time' with a child?",
            "options": [
                "Structured educational activities chosen by the parent",
                "Child-led play where the parent follows the child's lead without correction or direction",
                "Family meetings focused on household chores and responsibilities",
                "Reward-based outings for good behavior throughout the week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Child-led play (often called 'Special Time' or 'PRIDE' skills in PCIT) is the gold standard for strengthening the attachment bond, as it validates the child's autonomy and provides undiluted positive attention."

            "id": "final_7",
            "question": "Under 'Reinforce Growth', how should a coach instruct a parent to use 'Specific Encouragement' versus 'Global Praise'?",

                "Global Praise: 'Good job.' Specific Encouragement: 'I'll give you a sticker for that.'",
                "Global Praise: 'You're the best artist.' Specific Encouragement: 'You are so talented.'",
                "Specific Encouragement should only be used for major milestones, not daily tasks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Specific Encouragement focuses on the effort and the action ('I noticed you shared'), whereas Global Praise labels the child ('Good boy'), which can lead to a fixed mindset and pressure to maintain the label."

        {
            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "In 'Empower Autonomy' (Module 7), the 'Scaffolding' technique involves:",
            "options": [
                "Setting strict boundaries that the child cannot cross",

                "Withdrawing all support to let the child 'figure it out' through trial and error"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding is a developmental concept where the parent provides just enough support to bridge the gap between what the child can do alone and what they can do with help, gradually withdrawing that support as the child gains mastery."

        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a child who has frequent 'meltdowns.' During the assessment (Module 20), the coach uses the 'ABC' model. What does 'ABC' stand for in behavioral analysis?",
            "options": [
                "Action, Behavior, Consequence",
                "Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ABC model stands for Antecedent (what happened before), Behavior (what the child did), and Consequence (what happened after). This is a foundational tool for 'Notice & Observe'."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "Regarding 'Ethical Considerations' (Module 22), when is it mandatory for a Positive Parenting Coach to refer a client to a licensed mental health professional?",

                "When the coach wants to increase their hourly rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Coaching focuses on the present and future behavioral strategies. Deep exploration of clinical trauma or mental health disorders (like MDD or PTSD) falls outside the coaching scope of practice and requires a referral to a therapist."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_11",
            "question": "In 'Research & Evidence' (Module 19), meta-analyses on Positive Parenting interventions show the strongest effect sizes in which area?",

                "Immediate obedience without the need for explanation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extensive research (e.g., studies on Triple P and Incredible Years) consistently shows that positive parenting strategies significantly reduce externalizing behaviors by improving the parent-child relationship and teaching self-regulation."

        {
            "id": "final_12",
            "question": "Which 'Advanced Technique' (Module 23) involves the parent 'mirroring' the child's emotional state to build empathy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening involves hearing the child's message and reflecting the underlying feeling back to them (e.g., 'It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated that the tower fell'). This is key to 'Unite through Connection'."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_13",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During a 'brain storm' (meltdown), the child's rational brain is offline. The priority is safety and co-regulation. Verbal reasoning or discipline should wait until the child is back within their Window of Tolerance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Niching allows a coach to become a 'specialist' rather than a 'generalist,' making it easier to attract clients who have specific needs (e.g., neurodiversity, single parenting, or high-conflict divorce)."

            "options": [
                "Intensity is too scary for children",
                "Consistent, small routines create neural pathways through repetition and provide a sense of safety",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is driven by consistent repetition. Small, daily routines (like a consistent bedtime ritual) are more effective at shaping behavior and providing emotional security than occasional high-intensity interventions."
