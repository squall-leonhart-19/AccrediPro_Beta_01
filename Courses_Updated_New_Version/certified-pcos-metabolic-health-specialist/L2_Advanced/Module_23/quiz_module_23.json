            "question": "When performing functional lab analysis for a PCOS client, what is the 'optimal' range for fasting insulin to indicate peak metabolic sensitivity, as opposed to standard laboratory reference ranges?",
            "options": ["2.0 - 5.0 uIU/mL", "10.0 - 15.0 uIU/mL", "Under 24.9 uIU/mL", "5.0 - 12.0 uIU/mL"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While standard labs often allow fasting insulin up to 24.9 uIU/mL, functional medicine considers 2.0 - 5.0 uIU/mL (or at most <7) as optimal for metabolic health and PCOS remission."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "A client using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) notices her glucose rises from 90 mg/dL to 145 mg/dL after a meal. According to advanced metabolic tuning standards, how should this 'spike' be interpreted?",
            "options": ["It is normal as long as it stays under 180 mg/dL.", "It is a significant excursion; the goal is a rise of no more than 30 mg/dL from baseline.", "It is optimal because it occurred after a meal.", "It indicates Type 2 Diabetes regardless of fasting levels."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For metabolic tuning in PCOS, we look for glycemic variability. An ideal postprandial rise should be capped at 30 mg/dL above the pre-meal baseline to prevent androgen surges."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In the context of circadian entrainment, why is 'front-loading' calories (eating a larger breakfast and smaller dinner) specifically beneficial for PCOS ovulation?",
            "options": ["It increases evening cortisol to help with sleep.", "It reduces the thermic effect of food.", "It improves insulin sensitivity and reduces the LH/FSH ratio.", "It prevents the 'Dawn Phenomenon' entirely."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies on chrononutrition in PCOS show that high-calorie breakfasts improve insulin sensitivity and significantly lower testosterone and LH levels compared to high-calorie dinners."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "During the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, what physiological change necessitates a shift in movement periodization for PCOS clients?",
            "options": ["Increased insulin sensitivity requiring higher intensity.", "Lower core body temperature requiring more warm-up time.", "Increased resting heart rate and metabolic rate due to progesterone.", "Peak ligament laxity increasing the risk of ACL injury."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the luteal phase, progesterone increases core temperature and resting heart rate, making high-intensity exercise feel more taxing and potentially increasing perceived exertion and stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical combination demonstrates a 'synergistic effect' by improving both insulin signaling and reducing oxidative stress in the follicular fluid?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D and Magnesium", "Myo-Inositol and Melatonin", "Berberine and Fish Oil", "Vitex and Zinc"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced protocols often combine Myo-Inositol with Melatonin, as studies show this synergy improves oocyte quality and fertilization rates more effectively than Inositol alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "If a client has elevated Beta-glucuronidase on a functional stool test, which 'estrobolome' intervention is most indicated to prevent the reabsorption of estrogen?",
            "options": ["Increasing intake of fermented dairy", "Supplementing with Calcium D-Glucarate", "High-dose probiotics only", "Reducing total fiber intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calcium D-Glucarate inhibits the enzyme Beta-glucuronidase, which otherwise 'un-couples' conjugated estrogens in the gut, allowing them to be reabsorbed into circulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "In 'Psychological Neuroplasticity' training, what is the purpose of the 'Stop-Breathe-Refly' technique for a client experiencing a PCOS-related body image trigger?",
            "options": ["To suppress the emotion so it doesn't affect hormones.", "To bypass the prefrontal cortex and activate the amygdala.", "To weaken the neural 'default mode' of self-criticism and strengthen the self-compassion pathway.", "To ensure the client immediately enters a state of ketosis."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity techniques aim to interrupt automatic negative thought patterns (the default mode) and consciously choose a new response, eventually rewiring the brain's reaction to triggers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "According to the 'Flare Management' protocol, what is the first step a practitioner should take when a client in long-term remission experiences a return of cystic acne?",
            "options": ["Immediately restart all previous supplements at double dose.", "Perform a 'Root Cause Audit' of recent sleep, stress, and circadian disruptors.", "Prescribe a 3-day water fast to reset insulin.", "Advise the client that remission has likely ended permanently."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Root Cause Audit' identifies whether the flare is due to a specific lifestyle 'slip' (like travel or high stress) or a deeper metabolic shift, allowing for a targeted rather than reactive response."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A functional lab panel shows a Ferritin level of 22 ng/mL in a PCOS client complaining of thinning hair. How should a specialist interpret this result?",
            "options": ["It is perfectly normal as it is within the standard range (15-150).", "It is high, suggesting iron overload and inflammation.", "It is functionally low; hair regrowth typically requires a Ferritin level of at least 70-100 ng/mL.", "It is irrelevant to PCOS symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges for hair health are much narrower than standard ranges. For follicular regeneration, Ferritin levels below 70 ng/mL are often insufficient, even if 'normal' on standard labs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "Which CGM metric is most closely associated with 'Metabolic Flexibility'—the body's ability to switch between burning glucose and fat?",
            "options": ["Average Glucose", "Estimated A1c", "Nocturnal Glucose Stability", "Post-exercise Glucose Recovery Rate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nocturnal glucose stability (a flat line during sleep) indicates the body has successfully transitioned into fat-burning (ketogenesis/gluconeogenesis) without significant cortisol-driven glucose spikes."
