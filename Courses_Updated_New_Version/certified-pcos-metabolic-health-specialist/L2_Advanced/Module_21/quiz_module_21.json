            "question": "In the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Method™, which phase is prioritized first to prevent 'metabolic adaptation' and ensure the HPA-axis is not further compromised?",
            "options": [
                "Phase 1: Stabilization & Inflammation Reduction",
                "Phase 2: Thermal Regulation & Fat Loss",
                "Phase 3: Endocrine Optimization",
                "Phase 4: Yield & Maintenance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Stabilization phase (S) focuses on calming the nervous system and reducing systemic inflammation before introducing caloric deficits or high-intensity stressors, which prevents the 'rebound' effect common in PCOS."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When treating Phenotype A (Classic PCOS), which combination of interventions has shown the highest efficacy in clinical trials for restoring ovulation?",
            "options": [
                "Low-fat diet and HIIT exercise only",
                "Myo-inositol (40:1 ratio) combined with a Low-Glycemic Load (GL) nutritional plan",
                "High-protein ketogenic diet without supplementation",
                "Caloric restriction (1200 kcal) regardless of macronutrient split"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phenotype A involves the full triad of symptoms; the 40:1 Myo/D-chiro inositol ratio specifically addresses the underlying insulin resistance and ovarian signaling issues characteristic of this phenotype."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the principles of Advanced Nutritional Periodization, what is the primary goal of a 'Metabolic Break' every 8-12 weeks?",
            "options": [
                "To allow the client to eat processed foods",
                "To reset the thyroid hormone (T3) and leptin levels to maintain metabolic rate",
                "To increase the speed of weight loss during the break",
                "To test if the client can maintain weight without exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic breaks (bringing calories back to maintenance) prevent the down-regulation of T3 and leptin, which typically occurs during prolonged caloric restriction, especially in metabolically sensitive PCOS patients."

        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client on Metformin therapy for PCOS should be monitored for which specific micronutrient deficiency that can exacerbate PCOS-related fatigue and neuropathy?",

                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Magnesium",
                "Vitamin K2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term Metformin use is clinically proven to interfere with Vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum, often requiring supplementation to prevent deficiency-related fatigue and nerve issues."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Which exercise prescription is most effective for increasing GLUT4 translocation and improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS without over-stimulating the HPA-axis?",
            "options": [
                "Daily 60-minute HIIT sessions",
                "Chronic cardio (running 10+ miles per week)",

                "Yoga and stretching only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resistance training increases muscle mass and the density of GLUT4 glucose transporters, providing a 'glucose sink' that improves insulin sensitivity without the excessive cortisol spike of daily HIIT."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In the context of Circadian Alignment, why is 'Front-Loading' calories (eating a larger breakfast and smaller dinner) specifically beneficial for PCOS metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "It makes it easier to skip lunch",
                "Insulin sensitivity is naturally higher in the morning due to circadian gene expression",
                "It prevents the need for any supplementation",
                "It reduces the body's need for sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that PCOS patients have improved glucose tolerance and lower androgen levels when the majority of daily calories are consumed earlier in the day when insulin sensitivity is circadian-optimized."

        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'Gold Standard' for monitoring long-term metabolic flexibility and the risk of progression to Type 2 Diabetes in PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",

                "Weight on the scale",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH) levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While HbA1c is useful, HOMA-IR provides a more sensitive measurement of insulin resistance, often catching metabolic dysfunction years before blood sugar levels rise into the pre-diabetic range."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Environmental 'Detoxification' in PCOS treatment planning focuses primarily on reducing exposure to which class of chemicals known to disrupt endocrine function?",
            "options": [
                "Carbon Dioxide",
                "Xenoestrogens (like BPA and Phthalates)",
                "Nitrogen",
                "Sodium Chloride"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that mimic estrogen and can bind to androgen receptors, worsening the hormonal imbalance in PCOS."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "When addressing Gut-Microbiome Repair, what is the significance of reducing 'Metabolic Endotoxemia'?",
            "options": [
                "It reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood",
                "It prevents Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from entering systemic circulation and triggering insulin receptor resistance",
                "It increases the production of stomach acid",
                "It allows for the consumption of high-fructose corn syrup"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leaky gut allows LPS (bacterial toxins) into the blood, which triggers systemic inflammation and directly interferes with insulin signaling at the cellular level."

        {
            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "In the 'Relapse Prevention' stage of treatment planning, what is the recommended frequency for 'Vitality Check-ins' to ensure long-term maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "Every 5 years",
                "Only when symptoms return",
                "Quarterly (every 3 months) for the first year post-intervention",
                "Daily for the rest of the client's life"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Quarterly check-ins during the first year of maintenance allow for early detection of 'metabolic drift' and adjustment of strategies before a full symptomatic relapse occurs."
