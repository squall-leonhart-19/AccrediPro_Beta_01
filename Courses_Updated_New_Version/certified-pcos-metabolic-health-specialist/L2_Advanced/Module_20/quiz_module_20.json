        {
            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "According to the Rotterdam Criteria used in Lesson 1, which Phenotype is characterized by Hyperandrogenism and Ovulatory Dysfunction, but WITHOUT the presence of Polycystic Ovaries on ultrasound?",
            "options": ["Phenotype A (Classic)", "Phenotype B (Essential)", "Phenotype C (Ovulatory)", "Phenotype D (Non-Androgenic)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phenotype B (Essential) includes clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction, but does not require polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) for diagnosis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a Fasting Insulin of 18 µIU/mL and Fasting Glucose of 95 mg/dL. Using the HOMA-IR formula (Insulin x Glucose / 405), what is her score and what does it indicate?",
            "options": ["1.2; Insulin Sensitive", "2.8; Borderline Resistance", "4.2; Significant Insulin Resistance", "8.5; Severe Type 2 Diabetes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "(18 * 95) / 405 = 4.22. In PCOS clinical practice, a HOMA-IR > 2.0-2.5 is typically indicative of insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the Free Androgen Index (FAI) is highlighted as a critical metric. How is FAI calculated?",
            "options": ["(Total Testosterone / SHBG) x 100", "(DHEAS / Total Testosterone) x 10", "(Free Testosterone + Androstenedione) / 2", "(SHBG / Albumin) x 100"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The FAI is calculated by dividing Total Testosterone by SHBG and multiplying by 100 to determine the amount of bioavailable testosterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "When evaluating Thyroid function in PCOS (Lesson 4), why is a TSH of 3.5 mIU/L potentially significant even if it falls within the 'standard' lab range (0.4-4.5)?",
            "options": ["It indicates hyperthyroidism", "It is optimal for metabolic health", "It may represent subclinical hypothyroidism which exacerbates PCOS symptoms", "It proves the HPA axis is overactive"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional medicine and fertility standards often view TSH > 2.5 mIU/L as suboptimal for PCOS patients, as subclinical hypothyroidism can worsen insulin resistance and ovulatory dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) reveals a client has high 'Glycemic Variability' despite a normal HbA1c of 5.2%. Why is this finding important in Lesson 5?",
            "options": ["It isn't; HbA1c is the only metric that matters for long-term health", "High variability (spikes and crashes) triggers oxidative stress and androgen production", "It indicates the client is eating too much protein", "It suggests the CGM is calibrated incorrectly"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glycemic variability (frequent glucose swings) can trigger oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways that stimulate the theca cells to produce more androgens, even if the average glucose (HbA1c) looks normal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses the 'Gut-Hormone Axis.' Which biomarker is most associated with 'Leaky Gut' (intestinal permeability) and systemic LPS-induced inflammation in PCOS?",
            "options": ["Albumin", "Zonulin", "Bilirubin", "Creatinine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the digestive tract; elevated levels are a marker for increased intestinal permeability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "In Body Composition analysis (Lesson 7), why is Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) more clinically significant than subcutaneous fat for a PCOS specialist?",
            "options": ["VAT is easier to lose through exercise", "VAT is metabolically active and secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines directly into the portal vein", "VAT does not affect insulin sensitivity", "Subcutaneous fat is the primary driver of hirsutism"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VAT is highly 'immunometabolic,' meaning it secretes inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha) that drive systemic insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "What does the 'S' in the STEADY Method™ Integrated Assessment Protocol stand for?",
            "options": ["Standardized Testing", "Subjective & Symptom Mapping", "Steroid Hormone Profiling", "Sugar & Glucose Metrics"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The STEADY Method™ begins with 'Subjective & Symptom Mapping' to ensure the clinician understands the client's lived experience before looking at lab data."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A 'Kraft Type III' insulin response curve on an Oral Glucose Insulin Tolerance Test (OGTT) is characterized by:",
            "options": ["A flat insulin line", "An early insulin peak at 30 minutes", "A delayed insulin peak at 120 minutes or later", "Immediate hypoglycemia"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Kraft Type III (Delayed Peak) is a common sign of occult insulin resistance where the pancreas overproduces insulin late in the digestive process to manage glucose."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "If a client has a high DHEAS but normal Total Testosterone and normal LH/FSH ratio, which system should the practitioner prioritize for assessment based on Lesson 4?",
            "options": ["The Ovaries", "The HPA Axis (Adrenals)", "The Thyroid", "The Gallbladder"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHEAS is produced almost exclusively by the adrenal glands. High DHEAS with normal ovarian markers suggests an adrenal-driven phenotype or HPA axis dysfunction."
