        {
            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client presents with secondary amenorrhea, low BMI (19.0), and high stress levels. Which laboratory finding would most strongly suggest Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (HA) rather than Lean PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "An LH:FSH ratio of 3:1",
                "Low LH ( < 2 IU/L) and low-normal FSH",
                "Elevated Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH)",
                "Presence of 12+ follicles on a transvaginal ultrasound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In HA, the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is suppressed, leading to low LH and FSH. In Lean PCOS, LH is typically elevated, often resulting in a high LH:FSH ratio."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "When managing a client experiencing 'Post-Pill Androgen Rebound,' at what time interval following hormonal contraceptive discontinuation do symptoms like cystic acne and hirsutism typically peak?",
            "options": [
                "2-4 weeks",
                "3-6 months",
                "10-12 months",
                "Immediately after the first withdrawal bleed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The androgen rebound effect, caused by the sudden drop in Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) and the 'awakening' of the ovaries, typically peaks between 3 and 6 months post-pill."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "To differentiate between 'Adrenal PCOS' and Non-Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (NCAH), which specific marker should be tested during the early follicular phase?",
            "options": [
                "DHEA-S",
                "Androstenedione",
                "17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP)",
                "Free Testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "17-OHP is the primary screening marker for NCAH. Levels above 200 ng/dL (6 nmol/L) suggest NCAH and usually warrant a follow-up ACTH stimulation test."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to international evidence-based guidelines, what is the minimum duration an adolescent must be post-menarche before 'irregular cycles' can be used as a definitive diagnostic criterion for PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "6 months",
                "1 year",
                "2 years",
                "5 years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the natural maturation of the HPO axis, menstrual irregularity is common in the first two years post-menarche. PCOS should not be formally diagnosed using cycle criteria until at least 2 years after the first period."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Which metabolic factor is most significantly associated with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) in PCOS patients, specifically regarding its effect on fibrinolysis and uterine blood flow?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated Homocysteine",
                "Low Vitamin D",
                "Elevated Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)",
                "High Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PAI-1 is often elevated in PCOS due to hyperinsulinemia. High PAI-1 inhibits fibrinolysis (clot breakdown), which can lead to placental insufficiency and increased risk of early miscarriage."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A 48-year-old client with a history of PCOS is entering perimenopause. What is the typical trend for androgen levels in PCOS women compared to their non-PCOS peers during this transition?",
            "options": [
                "Androgens drop to undetectable levels immediately",
                "Androgens remain higher than non-PCOS peers, potentially delaying the onset of menopause",
                "Androgens increase significantly due to LH surges",
                "Androgens stay exactly the same as they were in her 20s"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While androgens do decline with age, women with PCOS maintain higher testosterone and androstenedione levels into their 40s and 50s compared to women without PCOS, which may offer some protection against bone loss but prolongs androgenic symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Research indicates that women with PCOS are approximately how many times more likely to develop Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis compared to the general population?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 times",
                "3 times",
                "10 times",
                "There is no statistically significant link"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies, including meta-analyses, have shown that PCOS patients have a 3-fold increased risk of Hashimoto’s, likely due to the interplay of estrogen dominance and immune dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Metabolic Resistance' and weight loss plateaus in PCOS, what is the primary mechanism of 'Adaptive Thermogenesis'?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in digestive enzymes",
                "A disproportionate decrease in resting metabolic rate (RMR) relative to weight loss",
                "A sudden surge in thyroid hormone production",
                "The 'Whoosh Effect' of water retention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis is the body's survival mechanism where the metabolic rate drops further than what would be predicted by the loss of body mass alone, often making further weight loss difficult."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Which clinical sign is a 'red flag' that suggests hyperandrogenism may be caused by an androgen-secreting tumor rather than standard PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Acne that persists after age 25",
                "Mild hirsutism on the upper lip",
                "Rapid onset ( < 6 months) of severe virilization and total testosterone > 200 ng/dL",
                "A history of irregular cycles since puberty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PCOS is typically a slow-onset condition starting at puberty. Rapid virilization (deepening voice, clitoromegaly) and extremely high testosterone levels are indicators of potential malignancy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A 'Lean PCOS' client is struggling with infertility. She has a high follicle count but does not ovulate. Her fasting insulin is 5 uIU/mL (optimal). What is the most likely driver of her ovulatory dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "Severe Insulin Resistance",
                "Hypocaloric intake or 'Relative Energy Deficiency' (RED-S) masking as PCOS",
                "Excessive dietary fiber intake",
                "Ovarian aging"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Lean PCOS, even if fasting insulin is normal, the client may be 'functionally' under-fueled or over-stressed, causing a hybrid state of HA and PCOS where the HPO axis lacks the energy signaling required for ovulation."
