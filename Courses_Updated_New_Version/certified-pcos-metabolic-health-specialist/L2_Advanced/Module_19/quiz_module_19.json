        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "When critically appraising PCOS literature as discussed in Lesson 1, which statistical value provides the most insight into the clinical magnitude of an intervention's effect rather than just the probability of chance?",
            "options": ["P-value", "Effect Size (e.g., Cohen's d)", "Standard Deviation", "Sample Size (n)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the p-value indicates statistical significance, the effect size measures the magnitude of the difference between groups, which is essential for determining clinical relevance in PCOS interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "According to meta-analyses of macronutrient distribution (Lesson 2), which factor was found to be more critical for improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients than the specific ratio of carbohydrates to fats?",
            "options": ["Complete elimination of dairy", "High intake of saturated fats", "Reduction in Glycemic Load and achievement of caloric deficit", "Intermittent fasting for exactly 16 hours"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses suggest that while various diets work, reducing the glycemic load and achieving a caloric deficit are the primary drivers of metabolic improvement, regardless of the specific carb-to-fat ratio."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Research into the HPA-Ovarian axis (Lesson 3) suggests that 'functional adrenal hyperandrogenism' in many PCOS patients is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": ["An exaggerated adrenocortical response to ACTH stimulation", "A complete lack of cortisol production", "Low levels of DHEA-S in 90% of cases", "Suppression of the sympathetic nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Evidence shows that a subset of PCOS patients (approx. 20-30%) exhibits an exaggerated adrenal androgen response to ACTH, linking stress-axis dysregulation to hyperandrogenism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the 'Science of Myokines.' Which myokine is specifically noted for its ability to promote the 'browning' of white adipose tissue and enhance insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": ["Myostatin", "Irisin", "Cortisol", "Leptin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Irisin is a myokine released during exercise that facilitates the conversion of white adipose tissue to beige/brown fat, improving thermogenesis and glucose metabolism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In the context of Toxicology (Lesson 5), what does the 'non-monotonic dose-response' curve of many EDCs imply for PCOS patients?",
            "options": ["Higher doses are always more toxic than lower doses", "Low-level exposure can sometimes have more significant endocrine effects than high-level exposure", "EDCs only have an effect at extremely high industrial levels", "The body becomes immune to EDCs over time"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs often follow a non-monotonic curve, meaning low-dose exposures can be highly disruptive to the endocrine system, making even 'trace' amounts relevant to PCOS pathology."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Microbiome research (Lesson 6) has consistently shown that women with PCOS tend to have lower 'Alpha Diversity.' What does this term refer to?",
            "options": ["The total number of bacteria in the gut", "The speed of digestion", "The variety and richness of different bacterial species within a single sample", "The ratio of bacteria to viruses in the colon"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha diversity measures the variety and distribution of species within a single environment (the gut); lower diversity is strongly correlated with insulin resistance and inflammation in PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Based on longitudinal outcomes research (Lesson 7), women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. What is the approximate Hazard Ratio (HR) found in several large-scale studies?",
            "options": ["1.2 (20% increase)", "1.5 (50% increase)", "2.5 to 4.0 (250-400% increase)", "10.0 (1000% increase)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal data consistently shows a significantly elevated risk for T2DM in PCOS populations, with hazard ratios typically ranging between 2.5 and 4.0 compared to age-matched controls."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "The STEADY Framework (Lesson 8) is used to translate research into clinical practice. What does the 'D' in STEADY stand for?",
            "options": ["Diagnostic", "Dynamic (Adjustable based on client response)", "Definitive", "Dose-dependent"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'D' stands for Dynamic, emphasizing that evidence-based protocols must be adjusted based on the individual client's physiological and lifestyle feedback."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A client with PCOS and high stress levels (HPA axis involvement) is performing 6 days of high-intensity exercise. Based on the research in Lesson 3 and 4, why might this be counterproductive?",
            "options": ["It causes too much muscle growth", "Excessive HIIT without recovery can chronically elevate cortisol and adrenal androgens", "Exercise has no effect on insulin", "It reduces the production of Myostatin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While exercise is beneficial, excessive intensity without recovery can overstimulate the HPA axis, potentially worsening adrenal androgen levels and metabolic stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "When evaluating a study on EDCs and PCOS, you see a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for an Odds Ratio of 1.45 (CI 0.92–2.10). How should you interpret this result?",
            "options": ["The result is statistically significant", "The result is not statistically significant because the interval includes 1.0", "The exposure is definitely the cause of PCOS", "The sample size was too large"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In odds ratios or relative risks, if the 95% confidence interval includes 1.0, the results are generally considered not statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level."
