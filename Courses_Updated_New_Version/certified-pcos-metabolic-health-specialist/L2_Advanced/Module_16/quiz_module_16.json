            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "A 24-year-old client presents with a BMI of 19.5, secondary amenorrhea for 8 months, and a history of intensive marathon training. Lab results show LH: 1.2 IU/L, FSH: 4.5 IU/L, and Estradiol: <20 pg/mL. What is the most likely primary diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "Lean PCOS (Phenotype D)",
                "Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (HA)",
                "Adrenal PCOS",
                "Premature Ovarian Failure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low LH, low Estradiol, and a low LH:FSH ratio (<1) combined with a low BMI and high exercise volume are classic indicators of Hypothalamic Amenorrhea, rather than Lean PCOS where LH is typically elevated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In a client with Severe Insulin Resistance (Metabolic Syndrome), which TG:HDL-C ratio is considered a significant predictor of insulin sensitivity impairment and cardiovascular risk?",
            "options": [
                "A ratio greater than 1.0",
                "A ratio greater than 2.0",
                "A ratio greater than 3.0",
                "A ratio greater than 0.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Triglyceride to HDL-C ratio > 3.0 is a highly specific marker for insulin resistance and is often used in advanced case management to identify metabolic syndrome in PCOS patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "Which specific androgen is the primary marker for 'Adrenal PCOS,' and at what level does it typically suggest an adrenal-driven phenotype in the absence of elevated testosterone?",
            "options": [
                "Androstenedione > 200 ng/dL",
                "DHEA-S > 350-400 µg/dL",
                "DHT > 50 ng/dL",
                "Free Testosterone > 5.0 pg/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHEA-S is produced almost exclusively by the adrenal glands. Levels above 350-400 µg/dL in the presence of normal testosterone suggest that the HPA-axis, rather than the HPO-axis, is the primary driver of hyperandrogenism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "According to the 40:1 ratio protocol for Myo-Inositol and D-Chiro-Inositol, what is the primary physiological benefit of maintaining this specific ratio for fertility cases?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for Metformin in all patients",
                "It prevents the 'D-Chiro-Inositol Paradox' which can impair egg quality",
                "It specifically targets the gut microbiome to reduce LPS",
                "It increases FSH levels to stimulate multiple follicles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio mimics physiological plasma levels. Excessive D-Chiro-Inositol (DCI) can be detrimental to the oocyte (the DCI Paradox), whereas the correct ratio supports both insulin signaling and egg quality."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A client in perimenopause with a history of PCOS reports a sudden worsening of abdominal weight gain despite no changes in diet. Which hormonal shift is the most likely driver in this transition?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in SHBG levels",
                "A decrease in the Testosterone:Estrogen ratio",
                "The loss of the protective effect of Estrogen against visceral fat deposition",
                "A sudden drop in DHEA-S"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During perimenopause, estrogen levels fluctuate and eventually decline, while testosterone levels may remain stable or decline more slowly. This increase in the T:E ratio promotes visceral fat storage and metabolic dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "What is the role of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the 'Gut-Hormone Axis' regarding PCOS pathology?",
            "options": [
                "LPS acts as a prebiotic to stimulate Bifidobacteria",
                "LPS triggers metabolic endotoxemia, which activates TLR4 receptors and induces insulin resistance",
                "LPS directly increases FSH production in the pituitary",
                "LPS inhibits the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS are endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria. When they cross a 'leaky' gut barrier, they cause systemic inflammation (metabolic endotoxemia) and bind to TLR4 receptors, directly interfering with insulin signaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In the differential diagnosis of PCOS vs. HA, how does the 'Progestin Challenge' typically result for an HA patient?",
            "options": [
                "A heavy withdrawal bleed within 3 days",
                "A light withdrawal bleed within 7-10 days",
                "No withdrawal bleed due to insufficient estrogen priming of the endometrium",
                "A withdrawal bleed only if the client is also taking Metformin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In HA, estrogen levels are typically so low that the endometrial lining does not thicken. Therefore, when progestin is withdrawn, there is no lining to shed, resulting in a negative challenge."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark characteristic of 'Phenotype C' (Ovulatory PCOS)?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperandrogenism and PCO morphology, but regular ovulatory cycles",
                "Amenorrhea and PCO morphology, but normal androgen levels",
                "Hyperandrogenism and Amenorrhea, but normal ovarian morphology",
                "Insulin resistance and obesity, but normal LH:FSH ratios"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phenotype C, or Ovulatory PCOS, involves hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, but the patient continues to have regular, ovulatory menstrual cycles."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "For a client with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) and PCOS, which intervention has shown a 20-30% reduction in miscarriage risk in those with documented insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose Vitamin C supplementation",
                "Standardized use of Metformin through the first trimester",
                "Elimination of all carbohydrates from the diet",
                "Daily vigorous aerobic exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While controversial in some guidelines, clinical data suggests that Metformin can reduce miscarriage rates in PCOS women with significant insulin resistance by improving uterine artery blood flow and metabolic stability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "When managing a 'Crisis to Remission' case, what is the 'Integrated Case Management' priority for a client with a fasting insulin of 25 µIU/mL and active suicidal ideation/severe depression?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate initiation of a Ketogenic diet",
                "Intensive resistance training 5 days a week",
                "Mental health stabilization and HPA-axis support before aggressive metabolic restriction",
                "Focusing solely on lowering Androstenedione with supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In integrated management, psychological safety and HPA-axis stability are the highest priorities. Aggressive dieting or over-exercising can worsen mental health and HPA dysfunction, making long-term metabolic recovery impossible."
