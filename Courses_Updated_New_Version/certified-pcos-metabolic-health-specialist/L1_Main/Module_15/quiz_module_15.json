            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "Which specific change in gut microbiota is most consistently observed in women with PCOS across various phenotypes, contributing to systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Increased alpha-diversity and species richness",
                "Decreased alpha-diversity and a reduction in beneficial species like Akkermansia",
                "A significant increase in Lactobacillus species compared to healthy controls",
                "A total absence of Bacteroidetes in the gut lumen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that women with PCOS exhibit reduced alpha-diversity (variety of species) and lower levels of beneficial, barrier-protecting bacteria like Akkermansia muciniphila, which correlates with increased intestinal permeability and insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the context of egg quality, how does Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation specifically support oocyte maturation in PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the total number of follicles recruited per cycle",
                "By blocking the action of Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "By enhancing mitochondrial ATP production and reducing oxidative stress in granulosa cells",
                "By directly lowering serum testosterone levels to zero"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 acts as a critical component of the electron transport chain; supplementation helps restore mitochondrial bioenergetics in the oocyte, which is essential for proper spindle formation and chromosomal segregation during maturation."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to clinical data, women with PCOS are approximately how many times more likely to develop Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) compared to non-PCOS populations?",
            "options": [
                "1.2 times",
                "3 times",
                "10 times",
                "There is no increased risk"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses indicate that women with PCOS face a roughly 3-fold (2.8 to 3.5x) increased risk of GDM, necessitating early screening and aggressive metabolic management during pregnancy."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "What is the 'PCOS Paradox' often observed during the perimenopause transition?",
            "options": [
                "Symptoms of PCOS completely disappear as soon as cycles stop",
                "Androgen levels rise significantly higher than they were in the 20s",
                "Menstrual cycles may become more regular as follicle count naturally declines, despite worsening metabolic markers",
                "Insulin sensitivity suddenly improves without any lifestyle intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'PCOS Paradox' refers to the observation that as ovarian reserve naturally declines with age, the excessive follicle pool in PCOS reduces, sometimes leading to more regular ovulatory cycles, even though cardiovascular and metabolic risks (like LDL and insulin resistance) typically increase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Which diagnostic finding is most indicative of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in a PCOS patient, even if liver enzymes (ALT/AST) appear within 'normal' lab ranges?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)",
                "An ALT level in the high-normal range (e.g., 25-35 U/L) combined with a high Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio",
                "Low levels of fasting insulin",
                "High levels of Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because 'normal' lab ranges for ALT are often set too high, values in the upper end of the normal range, especially when paired with dyslipidemia (high TG/low HDL), are strong clinical indicators of hepatic steatosis in PCOS."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the dermatological deep dive, which enzyme is identified as the primary driver for converting testosterone into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the pilosebaceous unit?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase",
                "5-alpha reductase",
                "Insulin Degrading Enzyme",
                "11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "5-alpha reductase is the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone into DHT, which has a much higher affinity for androgen receptors in the skin, leading to hirsutism and androgenic alopecia."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Research into the neuroendocrine links suggests that women with PCOS have a significantly higher prevalence of which neurodevelopmental condition?",
            "options": [
                "Alzheimer's Disease",
                "ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)",
                "Schizophrenia",
                "Multiple Sclerosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recent epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between PCOS and ADHD, potentially linked to prenatal androgen exposure and dopamine signaling dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Why is Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) prevalent in women with PCOS, even in those with a 'Lean' (non-obese) phenotype?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive intake of caffeine",
                "Hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, which can affect upper airway stability and central sleep drive",
                "High levels of progesterone causing airway constriction",
                "Lean women with PCOS do not get OSA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperandrogenism is a major risk factor for OSA in PCOS; high testosterone levels are associated with increased upper airway collapsibility and altered chemoreceptor sensitivity, independent of Body Mass Index (BMI)."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "To effectively improve oocyte quality and mitochondrial health prior to conception, what is the recommended minimum duration for a targeted supplement and lifestyle protocol?",
            "options": [
                "2 weeks",
                "4 weeks",
                "90 to 120 days",
                "1 year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The recruitment and maturation process of a primordial follicle into a pre-ovulatory follicle takes approximately 90-120 days. Interventions must cover this entire window to influence the metabolic environment of the developing egg."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key 'Silent Threat' clinical marker for cardiovascular risk specifically highlighted for the PCOS population?",
            "options": [
                "High HDL cholesterol",
                "Elevated C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) and increased Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT)",
                "Low blood pressure",
                "High levels of subcutaneous fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Even when traditional lipid panels look 'okay,' women with PCOS often have elevated hs-CRP (a marker of chronic inflammation) and increased CIMT (a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis), indicating higher cardiovascular risk than their age-matched peers."
