            "question": "Which neurological structure is primarily responsible for the 'automaticity' of habits, allowing metabolic behaviors to occur without conscious effort during the maintenance phase?",
            "options": [
                "Prefrontal Cortex",
                "Basal Ganglia",
                "Amygdala",
                "Hypothalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the Prefrontal Cortex is used for learning new tasks, the Basal Ganglia is responsible for storing and executing 'habit loops' that characterize the maintenance phase."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to the Maintenance Lab Protocol (L3), how frequently should a client in clinical remission typically monitor their HOMA-IR and HbA1c levels?",

                "Only when symptoms return"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For clients in the maintenance/remission phase, an annual or bi-annual check (6-12 months) is the standard for long-term monitoring unless a significant flare occurs."

                "Ordering only appetizers to limit total intake",
                "Drinking two glasses of water before every alcoholic beverage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Buffer Method uses a 'pre-load' of protein and fiber to stabilize blood glucose and improve satiety, preventing the insulin spikes common with restaurant meals."

                "The duration of a cortisol-lowering breathing exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Two-Minute Rule (from Lesson 2) focuses on 'showing up' by making the entry point of a habit so easy it is impossible to fail."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first step is a diagnostic audit of the 'Big 3' lifestyle pillars to identify if the flare is lifestyle-induced or requires clinical escalation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body Neutrality focuses on the body's functional capabilities (e.g., 'my legs allow me to hike') which is often more sustainable for PCOS clients than forced positivity."

            "options": [
                "To increase estrogen production",
                "To counteract sarcopenia and maintain insulin sensitivity via muscle mass",

                "To improve cardiovascular endurance specifically"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Muscle mass is the primary site of glucose disposal. During perimenopause, the natural loss of muscle (sarcopenia) can worsen insulin resistance, making resistance training critical."

                "To design the environment so the healthy choice is the default/easiest choice",
                "To eliminate all 'unhealthy' foods from the house permanently",
                "To create a strict schedule that must be followed exactly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choice Architecture is about environmental design (e.g., placing walking shoes by the door) to reduce the 'friction' of healthy habits."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration involves using data (like CGM or energy levels) as a neutral feedback loop to adjust lifestyle flow rather than a reactive tool for crisis management."
