            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adrenal PCOS is characterized by an overactive HPA axis resulting in elevated adrenal androgens (DHEA-S) often in the absence of significant insulin resistance or LH imbalances."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH to stimulate the theca cells, specifically upregulating the CYP17 enzyme which accelerates the conversion of precursors into androgens."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "In the 'Adrenal' PCOS connection, how does chronic HPA axis activation contribute to metabolic dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "By chronically lowering cortisol, leading to hypoglycemia",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic HPA activation leads to elevated cortisol, which triggers gluconeogenesis (raising blood sugar) and promotes the storage of visceral fat, further driving insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to the collection of gut bacteria capable of metabolizing estrogens. Which enzyme, when elevated due to dysbiosis, leads to the reabsorption of estrogen into circulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase deconjugates estrogen in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted, contributing to estrogen dominance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR above 2.0-2.5 generally indicates insulin resistance; a score of 3.8 is significantly elevated, suggesting high metabolic risk regardless of BMI."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone in the blood; when SHBG is low, more testosterone remains 'free' or unbound, allowing it to enter cells and cause symptoms like hirsutism and acne."
