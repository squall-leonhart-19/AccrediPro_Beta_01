            "question": "According to the Advanced Phenotyping lesson, which Rotterdam Phenotype is often referred to as 'Non-Androgenic PCOS' and may require a greater focus on metabolic signaling rather than androgen suppression?",
            "options": [
                "Phenotype A (Hyperandrogenism + Ovulatory Dysfunction + PCO Morphology)",
                "Phenotype B (Hyperandrogenism + Ovulatory Dysfunction)",
                "Phenotype C (Hyperandrogenism + PCO Morphology)",
                "Phenotype D (Ovulatory Dysfunction + PCO Morphology)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Phenotype D is the 'non-androgenic' phenotype. While these clients meet the Rotterdam criteria, they lack clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, requiring practitioners to look deeper into insulin dynamics and FSH/LH ratios."

        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "When utilizing Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for 'Precision Glucose Tuning,' what is the target 'Time in Range' (TIR) for the 70-140 mg/dL window to optimize follicular development?",
            "options": [
                "Greater than 70%",
                "Greater than 80%",
                "Greater than 90%",
                "Greater than 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To achieve 'Precision Tuning' for hormonal harmony, we aim for a TIR (70-140 mg/dL) of >90% to minimize glycemic variability, which is a known driver of oxidative stress in the theca cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In the 'OAT Axis' integration model, how does subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH >2.5 mIU/L) specifically exacerbate PCOS pathology?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) levels",
                "By decreasing SHBG, thereby increasing the 'Free Androgen Index'",
                "By directly stimulating the production of DHEA-S in the adrenals",
                "By inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low thyroid function (even subclinical) reduces the hepatic production of SHBG. Lower SHBG means more testosterone remains 'free' and biologically active, worsening hirsutism and acne."

        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "During the Late Luteal phase (the 'Hormonal Minimum'), which movement strategy is most appropriate for a PCOS client with high Adrenal/HPA-axis sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) to maximize insulin sensitivity",
                "Heavy compound lifting to boost basal metabolic rate",
                "Zone 2 cardio and restorative yoga to prevent cortisol-induced insulin resistance",
                "Fasted steady-state cardio to encourage fat oxidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During the late luteal phase, progesterone and estrogen drop. For HPA-sensitive PCOS clients, high-intensity work can overtax the adrenals; restorative movement maintains insulin sensitivity without spiking cortisol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' lesson highlights the enzyme Beta-Glucuronidase. What is the clinical consequence of an elevation of this enzyme in the gut microbiome of a PCOS patient?",
            "options": [
                "Increased excretion of excess testosterone through the stool",
                "De-conjugation of estrogens and androgens, leading to their reabsorption into circulation",
                "Enhanced synthesis of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)",
                "Inhibition of the 5-alpha reductase enzyme"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-glues' (de-conjugates) hormones that the liver has already processed for excretion, allowing them to re-enter the bloodstream and contribute to the total hormonal load."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "What is the physiological rationale for the 40:1 Myo-Inositol to D-Chiro-Inositol (MI:DCI) ratio in PCOS supplementation protocols?",
            "options": [
                "It mimics the ratio found in healthy human plasma and follicular fluid",
                "It is the ratio required to bypass the blood-brain barrier",
                "D-Chiro-Inositol is toxic at higher levels",
                "Myo-Inositol is 40 times cheaper to manufacture"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio is the physiological ratio found in plasma. In PCOS, the 'Inositol Paradox' suggests that ovaries may have an over-conversion of MI to DCI, making the specific 40:1 ratio critical for restoring balance."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Adrenal PCOS' (high DHEA-S, normal Testosterone, normal BMI). Which intervention is prioritized in the Module 8 protocols for this specific phenotype?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive caloric restriction and 16:8 intermittent fasting",
                "High-dose Berberine (1500mg/day)",
                "Magnesium, Vitamin C, and Adaptogens to modulate the HPA-axis response",
                "Low-carb ketogenic diet to suppress insulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adrenal-driven PCOS is characterized by HPA-axis dysfunction rather than primary insulin resistance. Interventions should focus on micronutrients and adaptogens that support the adrenal glands and lower the ACTH response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the 'Long-Term Monitoring' lesson, which biomarker is identified as the most sensitive 'Early Warning System' for a metabolic relapse in previously managed PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c",
                "Fasting Glucose",
                "Triglyceride-to-HDL Ratio",
                "Fasting Insulin (HOMA-IR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Fasting insulin and the calculated HOMA-IR score typically rise years before HbA1c or Fasting Glucose move out of the 'normal' range, making it the gold standard for early detection of metabolic drift."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Using 'Motivational Interviewing' in PCOS coaching (Lesson 8), if a client says, 'I know I should exercise, but I'm just too tired after work,' which response demonstrates 'Reflective Listening'?",
            "options": [
                "'You should try exercising in the morning instead.'",
                "'It sounds like your current energy levels are a significant barrier to your goals.'",
                "'If you don't exercise, your insulin resistance will get worse.'",
                "'Why don't you just take a pre-workout supplement?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening mirrors the client's experience without judgment or immediate advice, which builds rapport and helps the client explore their own 'change talk' and barriers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Based on the 2023 meta-analysis cited in the 'Integrative Supplementation' lesson, how does Berberine compare to Metformin in PCOS populations?",
            "options": [
                "Metformin is significantly superior for weight loss",
                "Berberine shows similar efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity with superior results in reducing waist-to-hip ratio and LDL cholesterol",
                "Berberine is only effective if taken with Metformin",
                "Berberine has no effect on androgen levels compared to placebo"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data shows Berberine is comparable to Metformin for insulin sensitivity but often outperforms it in improving lipid profiles and reducing visceral adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio)."
