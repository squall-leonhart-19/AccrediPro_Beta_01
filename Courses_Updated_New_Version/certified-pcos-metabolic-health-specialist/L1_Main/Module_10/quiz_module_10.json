            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "In the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Synthesis framework for complex phenotyping, what does the 'A' specifically represent when evaluating a client's hormonal profile?",
            "options": ["Adipose Tissue Distribution", "Adrenal Androgen Contribution", "Autoimmune Markers", "Anovulatory Frequency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the S.T.E.A.D.Y. framework, 'A' stands for Adrenal Androgen Contribution, requiring the practitioner to distinguish between ovarian and adrenal sources of hyperandrogenism (e.g., checking DHEA-S levels)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to the International Evidence-based Guideline, which criteria must be met to diagnose PCOS in an adolescent (less than 8 years post-menarche)?",
            "options": ["Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and irregular cycles", "Clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles", "Hirsutism and weight gain only", "Insulin resistance and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In adolescents, ultrasound is not reliable due to the high prevalence of multi-follicular ovaries in normal puberty. Diagnosis requires both clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism and persistent irregular cycles."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' Total Testosterone but symptoms of severe hirsutism. Which lab marker is most critical to evaluate to understand the 'free' hormone availability?",
            "options": ["Progesterone", "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)", "Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)", "Prolactin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone; when SHBG is low (often due to high insulin), more testosterone remains 'free' and biologically active, causing symptoms even if Total Testosterone appears normal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In the 'Therapeutic Glucose Tuning' (TGT) protocol, what is the primary target for the maximum allowable glucose rise two hours after a meal?",
            "options": ["< 10 mg/dL", "< 30 mg/dL", "< 60 mg/dL", "< 100 mg/dL"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TGT aims for high-resolution glucose stability, typically targeting a post-prandial rise of less than 30 mg/dL from the pre-meal baseline to minimize insulin spikes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which class of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) is specifically classified as 'obesogens' due to their ability to promote adipogenesis and interfere with lipid metabolism?",
            "options": ["Phthalates", "Phytoestrogens", "Vitamin D analogues", "Polyphenols"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and certain bisphenols (like BPA) act as obesogens by activating PPAR-gamma receptors, which triggers the development of fat cells and disrupts metabolic signaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Research indicates that women with PCOS are significantly more likely to experience which psychological condition compared to the general population?",
            "options": ["Binge Eating Disorder (BED)", "Narcissistic Personality Disorder", "Bipolar I Disorder", "Schizophrenia"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Women with PCOS have a 3-4 times higher prevalence of Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and other disordered eating patterns, often driven by insulin-induced hunger and hormonal dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "When creating a supplement protocol for a client with 'Classic' PCOS (Phenotype A), what is the clinically validated ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol (MI:DCI)?",
            "options": ["1:1", "10:1", "40:1", "100:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the physiological ratio found in plasma and has been shown to be most effective for restoring ovulation and improving insulin sensitivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A PCOS coach notices a client's lab results show a dangerously high TSH (12.0 mIU/L). Which action is the most ethically and professionally appropriate?",
            "options": ["Prescribe a high-dose iodine supplement immediately", "Tell the client to stop all current medications", "Refer the client to their primary care physician or endocrinerologist for medical evaluation", "Ignore the result as it is outside the scope of PCOS"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must work within their scope of practice. Identifying clinical pathology (like overt hypothyroidism) requires a referral to a licensed medical professional for diagnosis and treatment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Which lab finding is most indicative of the 'Adrenal' PCOS phenotype, where androgens are elevated but insulin sensitivity and ovarian morphology are relatively normal?",
            "options": ["Elevated DHEA-S with normal fasting insulin", "Low LH:FSH ratio", "High HOMA-IR with low Testosterone", "Elevated Progesterone in the follicular phase"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The adrenal phenotype is characterized by elevated DHEA-S (an adrenal androgen) without the significant insulin resistance or metabolic dysfunction typically seen in other phenotypes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "As a PCOS client transitions into menopause, which health risk becomes the primary focus for metabolic management?",
            "options": ["Risk of twins during pregnancy", "Cardiovascular disease and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)", "Iron deficiency anemia", "Endometriosis flares"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-menopause, the protective effects of estrogen diminish, and the lifelong metabolic stressors of PCOS culminate in significantly higher risks for CVD, hypertension, and NAFLD."
