            "question": "In the Gut-Brain-Ovary axis, what is the primary mechanism by which Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) contribute to the PCOS phenotype?",
            "options": [
                "LPS enters systemic circulation via 'leaky gut' and triggers TLR4 receptors, causing chronic inflammation that stimulates ovarian theca cells to produce androgens.",
                "LPS directly converts progesterone into testosterone within the intestinal lumen.",
                "LPS inhibits the pituitary gland, preventing the release of Luteinizing Hormone (LH).",
                "LPS acts as a prebiotic that specifically feeds beneficial Bifidobacterium strains."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "LPS from gram-negative bacteria can cross a compromised gut barrier, triggering systemic inflammation (metabolic endotoxemia) which activates theca cells to increase androgen production."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "For a client with the 'Adrenal PCOS' phenotype (elevated DHEA-S, lean BMI), why is a very-low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet often contraindicated?",
            "options": [
                "Ketogenic diets increase insulin sensitivity too rapidly for lean phenotypes.",
                "Inadequate carbohydrate intake can further elevate cortisol and HPA-axis stress, potentially worsening adrenal androgen output.",
                "Lean PCOS clients cannot digest fats efficiently due to gallbladder issues.",
                "Adrenal PCOS is caused by a lack of ketones in the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lean PCOS clients with high adrenal androgens often have dysregulated HPA-axis function; extreme carb restriction can be perceived as a stressor, further increasing cortisol and adrenal androgens."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Based on Circadian Biology (L3), which 'Chrononutrition' strategy has been shown in studies to improve insulin sensitivity and ovulation rates in PCOS women?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming 70% of total daily calories at dinner (Back-loading).",
                "Front-loading calories by consuming a large breakfast and a small dinner.",
                "Eating six small meals spaced exactly 2 hours apart throughout the night.",
                "Avoiding all protein until after 4:00 PM."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Jakubowicz et al.) shows that a large breakfast/small dinner approach improves insulin sensitivity and reduces testosterone more effectively than the reverse in PCOS populations."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "During the Mid-Luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, what physiological change necessitates an adjustment in exercise intensity for the PCOS client?",
            "options": [
                "A significant increase in core body temperature and higher cardiovascular strain due to progesterone.",
                "A sudden surge in testosterone that makes high-intensity interval training (HIIT) dangerous.",
                "The complete cessation of fat oxidation, making steady-state cardio useless.",
                "An increase in ligament laxity caused by a drop in relaxin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Progesterone raises the basal body temperature by about 0.5-1.0°F, increasing the heart rate and making exercise feel more difficult (higher RPE) and reducing heat tolerance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC) is most notorious for binding to androgen receptors and is frequently found at higher serum levels in women with PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium sulfate",
                "Bisphenol A (BPA)",
                "Vitamin K2",
                "Omega-3 fatty acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA is a known EDC that can interfere with hormone signaling and is positively correlated with higher androgen levels and insulin resistance in PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Postpartum Pivot' strategy regarding insulin resistance management after a PCOS pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately returning to a high-carbohydrate diet to support breastfeeding.",
                "Gradually reintroducing metabolic flexibility strategies while monitoring the return of the cycle, as insulin resistance often resurfaces after placental delivery.",
                "Stopping all exercise for 6 months to protect the pelvic floor.",
                "Using high-dose berberine regardless of breastfeeding status."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "After the placenta (which produces its own hormones) is delivered, the underlying PCOS metabolic environment returns; management must pivot to prevent a rapid rebound of insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Why does the perimenopause transition often present a 'double hit' to the metabolic health of a PCOS client?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen levels rise too high, causing rapid weight loss.",
                "The natural decline in estrogen (which is insulin-sensitizing) compounds with existing PCOS-related insulin resistance, increasing CVD risk.",
                "Testosterone levels drop to zero, causing muscle mass to double.",
                "The gut microbiome becomes completely dormant during perimenopause."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen helps maintain insulin sensitivity and healthy lipid profiles; when it drops during perimenopause, the pre-existing metabolic issues of PCOS are often exacerbated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Behavioral Psychology (L8), what is 'Implementation Intention' and how does it aid PCOS maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "It is a form of deep-tissue massage for stress relief.",
                "It is a 'Plan B' strategy using 'If-Then' statements to automate healthy responses to environmental triggers.",
                "It is the practice of intending to exercise without actually doing it.",
                "It is a strict rule that forbids any social eating."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions (If-Then planning) reduce decision fatigue by pre-deciding how to handle obstacles (e.g., 'If I am at a party with no healthy options, then I will stick to the protein and salad')."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) produced by gut bacteria is most critical for stimulating GLP-1 and PYY to improve satiety in PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Acetate",
                "Butyrate",
                "Lactate",
                "Ethanol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is a key SCFA that provides energy to colonocytes and stimulates the release of satiety hormones like GLP-1, which is often impaired in PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "In exercise periodization, why is the Late Follicular phase (pre-ovulation) often the best time for a PCOS client to attempt high-intensity training or strength PRs?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone is at its peak, providing sedative effects.",
                "Estrogen peaks, which has a mildly anabolic effect on muscle tissue and improves neuromuscular function.",
                "The body is in a state of 'metabolic hibernation'.",
                "Cortisol is naturally at its lowest possible point of the entire year."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrogen surge just before ovulation can enhance muscle force production and recovery, making it an ideal window for higher-intensity efforts."
