            "question": "In the 'Insulin-Androgen Axis,' how does hyperinsulinemia directly contribute to hyperandrogenism in PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "By inhibiting the production of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) in the pituitary gland",
                "By stimulating theca cells to produce androgens and sensitizing them to LH",
                "By increasing the production of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) in the liver",
                "By converting testosterone into estrogen within the adipose tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts as a co-gonadotropin, stimulating the ovarian theca cells to produce androgens and increasing their sensitivity to LH, while simultaneously suppressing SHBG production in the liver."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "If a specific food has a Glycemic Index (GI) of 70 but contains only 5 grams of available carbohydrates per serving, what is its Glycemic Load (GL) and how is it classified?",
            "options": [
                "GL of 3.5 (Low)",
                "GL of 14 (Medium)",
                "GL of 35 (High)",
                "GL of 7.0 (Low)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "GL is calculated as (GI x net carbs) / 100. (70 x 5) / 100 = 3.5. A GL below 10 is considered 'Low,' making this food a safe choice despite its high GI."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Macro-Buffer Strategy,' what is the scientifically validated sequence of food consumption to minimize postprandial glucose excursions?",
            "options": [
                "Carbohydrates first, followed by protein, then fiber",
                "Protein and fats first, followed by fiber, then carbohydrates",
                "Fiber first, followed by protein and fats, then carbohydrates",
                "All components consumed simultaneously for balanced digestion"
            ],
            "explanation": "Research shows that consuming fiber first, followed by protein and fats, and saving starches/sugars for last can reduce glucose spikes by up to 70% and insulin spikes by up to 40%.",

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the context of Chrono-Nutrition, why is it recommended that PCOS patients consume the bulk of their carbohydrates earlier in the day?",
            "options": [
                "Because cortisol levels are lowest in the morning",
                "Because skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity is highest in the morning due to circadian rhythms",
                "Because the thermic effect of food (TEF) is nonexistent at night",
                "Because melatonin increases insulin secretion in the early afternoon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peripheral clocks in skeletal muscle dictate that insulin sensitivity is significantly higher in the morning. Consuming carbs later in the evening, when melatonin begins to rise, can impair glucose tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following 'Hidden Glucose Disruptors' can cause a significant rise in fasting glucose levels due to an increase in cortisol and growth hormone?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming Stevia in moderation",
                "Drinking 2 liters of water daily",
                "A single night of restricted sleep (4 hours)",
                "Supplementing with Magnesium Glycinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even one night of sleep deprivation can induce temporary insulin resistance, raising fasting glucose and making the body more reactive to carbohydrates the following day."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When analyzing CGM data for a PCOS client, a 'Glycemic Variability' (Standard Deviation) consistently above which level indicates a need for better macro-buffering?",
            "options": [
                "Above 5 mg/dL",
                "Above 10 mg/dL",
                "Above 20 mg/dL",
                "Above 50 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional metabolic health, we look for a Standard Deviation (SD) of <20 mg/dL. Higher variability indicates frequent 'glucose rollercoasters' that trigger inflammatory and androgenic responses."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "What is the primary indicator that a client has exceeded their 'Carbohydrate Threshold' during a Metabolic Flexibility assessment?",
            "options": [
                "A postprandial glucose spike that returns to baseline within 2 hours",
                "A rise in energy and mental clarity 30 minutes after eating",
                "A glucose spike exceeding 140 mg/dL or a 'crash' below 70 mg/dL accompanied by brain fog",
                "A steady glucose line between 80-90 mg/dL throughout the day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Carbohydrate Threshold is reached when the intake of carbs causes an excessive excursion (>140 mg/dL) or a reactive hypoglycemic dip (<70 mg/dL), indicating the body cannot efficiently process that load."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "The clinically studied 40:1 ratio of Myo-Inositol to D-Chiro-Inositol is designed to mimic the physiological ratio found in which fluid?",
            "options": [
                "Follicular fluid of healthy ovaries",
                "Cerebrospinal fluid",
                "Hepatic portal vein blood",
                "Intracellular cytoplasm of muscle cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Healthy ovaries maintain a 40:1 ratio of MI to DCI. In PCOS, the 'Inositol Paradox' often results in an over-conversion of MI to DCI in the ovaries, disrupting egg quality."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Dawn Phenomenon' where their fasting glucose is higher than their pre-bedtime glucose. What is the most appropriate therapeutic adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "Increase carbohydrate intake at dinner to prevent overnight drops",
                "Implement a 10-minute walk after dinner and ensure 7-9 hours of quality sleep",
                "Omit the 'Macro-Buffer' during the last meal of the day",
                "Consume a high-sugar snack immediately upon waking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dawn Phenomenon is often driven by nocturnal cortisol/growth hormone spikes. Improving sleep hygiene and using post-meal movement to lower the glucose load before bed can mitigate this effect."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical acts as a 'glucose transporter mimetic' by activating AMPK, similar to the mechanism of Metformin?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Berberine",
                "Zinc Picolinate",
                "Vitex (Chasteberry)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine is a potent AMPK activator, which improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake into cells, often showing efficacy comparable to Metformin in clinical trials."
