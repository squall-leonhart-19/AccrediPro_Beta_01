            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Research indicates that women with PCOS exhibit a significantly higher risk for subclinical atherosclerosis. Which diagnostic marker is considered the most sensitive for detecting early-stage vascular changes in this population?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol to HDL ratio",
                "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT)",
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels",
                "Resting heart rate variability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) is a validated non-invasive marker for subclinical atherosclerosis and is frequently found to be elevated in women with PCOS, even when LDL levels remain within 'normal' ranges."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Women with PCOS have a 3-fold higher risk of developing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). According to international guidelines, when should an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) be performed for these patients?",
            "options": [
                "Only at 24-28 weeks of gestation",
                "Only if the patient's BMI is over 30 kg/m²",
                "Pre-conception and again at 24-28 weeks of gestation",
                "At the first postpartum check-up only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the high baseline risk of insulin resistance, women with PCOS should ideally be screened pre-conception (or at the first prenatal visit) and again at 24-28 weeks of gestation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "How does the PCOS phenotype typically shift as a patient transitions into menopause?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperandrogenism symptoms increase while insulin resistance resolves",
                "Menstrual cycles often become more regular, but metabolic risks (visceral adiposity) accelerate",
                "The 'PCOS' diagnosis is automatically revoked as ovaries atrophy",
                "Androgen levels rise significantly due to increased LH secretion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In menopause, the androgen/estrogen ratio shifts; while cycle regularity may improve as follicle count drops, the underlying metabolic dysfunction and abdominal fat distribution often worsen."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in PCOS. Beyond BMI, what physiological factor is most strongly associated with sleep-disordered breathing in this population?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated progesterone levels",
                "Hyperandrogenism (specifically high testosterone)",
                "Low Vitamin D levels",
                "Excessive intake of magnesium at night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show that hyperandrogenism is an independent risk factor for OSA in PCOS, potentially due to the influence of androgens on the upper airway and central respiratory drive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' influences PCOS pathology by regulating the enterohepatic circulation of estrogen. Which bacterial enzyme is responsible for deconjugating estrogen in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Lipase",
                "β-glucuronidase",
                "Protease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "β-glucuronidase is the primary enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that deconjugates estrogens, leading to their reabsorption and potentially contributing to estrogen dominance or hormonal imbalances."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Which psychological condition is reported to have a prevalence rate nearly 4 times higher in women with PCOS compared to the general population, requiring routine clinical screening?",
            "options": [
                "Bipolar Disorder",
                "Binge Eating Disorder (BED)",
                "Schizophrenia",
                "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and disordered eating patterns are significantly more common in PCOS due to the intersection of hormonal cravings (insulin/leptin resistance) and the psychological burden of the condition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A patient has been on 1500mg of Metformin daily for 4 years. She presents with fatigue and peripheral neuropathy. Which nutritional deficiency should be investigated first?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Magnesium",
                "Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term Metformin use (especially >3 years or at high doses) is a well-documented cause of Vitamin B12 malabsorption, which can lead to fatigue and neurological symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In long-term clinical monitoring of PCOS, why is the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) preferred over HbA1c for diagnosing impaired glucose tolerance?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c is too expensive for routine use",
                "HbA1c may underestimate glycemic excursions and early-stage insulin resistance in young women",
                "OGTT measures cortisol levels simultaneously",
                "HbA1c is only accurate in patients over age 50"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the PCOS population, HbA1c often fails to capture post-prandial glucose spikes and early insulin resistance, making the 2-hour 75g OGTT the 'gold standard' for screening."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "When managing a patient with PCOS and depression, what is a potential benefit of combining Myo-Inositol with standard SSRI therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Inositol completely replaces the need for SSRIs",
                "Inositol may enhance serotonin receptor sensitivity and mitigate SSRI-induced metabolic side effects",
                "Inositol prevents the absorption of the SSRI",
                "There is no known interaction or benefit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inositol acts as a second messenger in the brain; research suggests it may improve the efficacy of SSRIs while simultaneously addressing the insulin resistance that often leads to weight gain with psychiatric medications."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Postpartum management for a PCOS patient should emphasize lactation support. What metabolic benefit does breastfeeding for at least 6 months provide to the mother?",
            "options": [
                "It permanently cures PCOS",
                "It significantly improves postpartum insulin sensitivity and reduces the long-term risk of Type 2 Diabetes",
                "It increases androgen levels to help with muscle recovery",
                "It has no impact on metabolic health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lactation is a metabolically demanding process that improves glucose metabolism; for women with a history of GDM or PCOS, breastfeeding is a key strategy for reducing the risk of progressing to Type 2 Diabetes."
