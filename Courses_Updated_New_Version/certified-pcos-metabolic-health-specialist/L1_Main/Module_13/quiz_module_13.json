        {
            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Which specific gut bacterium is frequently found to be depleted in individuals with PCOS and is considered a 'sentinel' species for gut barrier integrity and insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "Lactobacillus acidophilus",
                "Akkermansia muciniphila",
                "Escherichia coli",
                "Bacteroides fragilis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading bacterium that strengthens the gut barrier; low levels are consistently linked to systemic inflammation and insulin resistance in PCOS populations."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of advanced fertility, what is the primary mechanism by which Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) improves oocyte quality in aging PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "By lowering serum testosterone levels",
                "By increasing the thickness of the endometrial lining",
                "By restoring mitochondrial ATP production and reducing oxidative stress",
                "By suppressing Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) secretion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oocyte quality is highly dependent on mitochondrial function. CoQ10 acts as an essential component of the electron transport chain, boosting ATP production and neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to meta-analyses regarding metabolic management in pregnancy, women with PCOS face approximately how much higher risk of developing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) compared to non-PCOS controls?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 times the risk",
                "3 times the risk",
                "10 times the risk",
                "The risk is the same if BMI is controlled"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Even after adjusting for BMI, women with PCOS have roughly a 3-fold (3x) increased risk of GDM due to pre-existing insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "During the PCOS-Menopause transition, which metabolic shift is most characteristic and contributes to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease?",
            "options": [
                "A significant increase in subcutaneous fat on the hips",
                "A decrease in total cholesterol levels",
                "The redistribution of fat from subcutaneous to visceral (android) depots",
                "A sudden drop in serum testosterone to undetectable levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As estrogen declines during menopause, the relative androgen excess in PCOS promotes visceral fat accumulation, which is highly metabolically active and pro-inflammatory."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In advanced lipidology for PCOS, why is Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) considered a superior marker to LDL-C for predicting cardiovascular risk?",
            "options": [
                "It measures the total number of all atherogenic particles, including VLDL and IDL",
                "It is cheaper and easier to test in a standard lipid panel",
                "It only measures the 'large buoyant' LDL particles",
                "It fluctuates less with dietary fat intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ApoB is found on every potentially atherogenic lipoprotein particle (LDL, VLDL, IDL). Since PCOS patients often have 'discordance' (high particle count but normal LDL-C), ApoB provides a more accurate assessment of risk."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which psychological framework is most effective for PCOS coaches to help clients move from 'Ambiance' to 'Action' by resolving internal conflict regarding lifestyle changes?",
            "options": [
                "Aversion Therapy",
                "Motivational Interviewing (MI)",
                "Classical Conditioning",
                "Authoritarian Coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motivational Interviewing is a client-centered counseling style that helps resolve ambivalence and taps into intrinsic motivation, which is critical for long-term PCOS management."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Which class of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs), often found in personal care products and fragrances, is specifically linked to increased androgen production and interference with thyroid signaling?",
            "options": [
                "Phthalates",
                "Organophosphates",
                "Heavy Metals",
                "Nitrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are known anti-androgenic and pro-oxidative EDCs that can disrupt the HPO axis and are frequently found in scented products and soft plastics."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "When utilizing Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) in a non-diabetic PCOS client, which metric is most useful for identifying 'silent' metabolic dysfunction that a standard HbA1c might miss?",
            "options": [
                "Mean Glucose",
                "Estimated HbA1c",
                "Glycemic Variability (standard deviation/spikes)",
                "Total Carbs Consumed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycemic variability (the height and frequency of postprandial spikes) can trigger inflammation and androgen production even if the average glucose (HbA1c) remains within a 'normal' range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "In the Phase II detoxification process of the liver, which pathway is specifically responsible for the neutralization of estrogen metabolites and is often sluggish in PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Oxidation",
                "Methylation",
                "Hydrolysis",
                "Reduction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methylation (via the COMT enzyme) is a key Phase II pathway for detoxifying catechol estrogens. Poor methylation can lead to an accumulation of DNA-damaging estrogen metabolites."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client has reached her goal weight and improved her cycle regularity. To prevent 'metabolic adaptation' and weight regain during the maintenance phase, what is the most evidence-based strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Staying on a very low-calorie diet indefinitely",
                "Eliminating all forms of resistance training",
                "Implementing 'diet breaks' and focusing on increasing non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)",
                "Switching entirely to a cardio-only exercise routine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintenance requires preventing the drop in metabolic rate. Increasing NEAT and using periodic diet breaks helps normalize hunger hormones and counteract metabolic adaptation."
