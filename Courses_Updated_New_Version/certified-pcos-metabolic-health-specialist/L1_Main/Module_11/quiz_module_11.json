            "question": "According to the 'Dysbiosis of Gut Microbiota' (DOGMA) theory discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary mechanism by which intestinal permeability triggers hyperandrogenism?",
            "options": [
                "Direct stimulation of the adrenal glands by Lactobacillus strains",
                "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation triggering an immune response that impairs insulin receptor signaling",
                "Excessive production of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) which stimulate the HPG axis",
                "The conversion of progesterone to testosterone within the gut lumen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DOGMA theory posits that gut dysbiosis leads to increased intestinal permeability, allowing LPS (endotoxins) to enter systemic circulation. This triggers low-grade inflammation, which interferes with insulin receptor function, leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia that stimulates ovarian androgen production."

            "question": "In the landmark study by Jakubowicz et al. (2013) on chrononutrition, what were the results for PCOS patients who consumed a high-calorie breakfast (980 kcal) compared to a high-calorie dinner?",
            "options": [
                "There was no significant difference in androgen levels between the groups",
                "The high-dinner group showed better weight loss but higher insulin resistance",
                "The high-breakfast group saw a 50% reduction in insulin resistance and a 50% drop in testosterone levels",
                "The high-breakfast group experienced increased cortisol levels that inhibited ovulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that timing calories earlier in the day (high-calorie breakfast) significantly improved insulin sensitivity and reduced free testosterone levels by 50% in lean PCOS women, highlighting the importance of circadian alignment."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "When screening an adolescent for PCOS (Lesson 3), why do international guidelines recommend waiting at least 2 years post-menarche before confirming a diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "Adolescent ovaries are too small to visualize on an ultrasound before this time",
                "Irregular cycles and multi-follicular ovarian morphology are common, normal features of physiological puberty",
                "Insulin resistance does not develop in females until after the age of 18",
                "Androgen levels are naturally suppressed during the first 24 months of menstruation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To avoid over-diagnosis, guidelines suggest waiting 2 years post-menarche because the hallmark signs of PCOS (irregular cycles and cystic-appearing ovaries) often mimic normal pubertal development during the transition period."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "In the context of Perimenopause and PCOS (Lesson 4), how does the 'metabolic shift' typically manifest compared to women without PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "PCOS symptoms usually disappear entirely once FSH levels begin to rise",
                "Women with PCOS often experience an earlier onset of menopause by 5-7 years",
                "The decline in estrogen exacerbates pre-existing insulin resistance, leading to a sharper increase in visceral adiposity",
                "Androgen levels drop to zero, eliminating the risk of cardiovascular disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As estrogen declines during perimenopause, the protective effects on insulin sensitivity are lost. For women with PCOS, this shift often results in a significant increase in visceral fat and metabolic syndrome risk compared to their peers."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "What is the specific physiological rationale for using a 40:1 ratio of Myo-Inositol to D-Chiro-Inositol in PCOS therapy?",
            "options": [
                "It is the ratio found in commercially available soft drinks",
                "It mimics the natural plasma ratio found in healthy individuals",
                "D-Chiro-Inositol is toxic at ratios higher than 1 part per 40",
                "It ensures that the liver converts all glucose into glycogen immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio is the physiological ratio found in human plasma. While Myo-inositol aids in FSH signaling and glucose uptake, excessive D-Chiro-inositol can actually impair oocyte quality, making the balanced ratio critical for ovarian health."

            "question": "How does chronic activation of the HPA axis (Stress) directly interfere with the HPG axis in PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol increases SHBG, which lowers free testosterone too much",
                "CRH and cortisol inhibit the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, disrupting LH/FSH secretion",
                "Stress hormones stimulate the gallbladder to release excess estrogen",
                "The HPA axis has no direct impact on the HPG axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress increases Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) and glucocorticoids, which suppress the GnRH pulse generator. This leads to disrupted gonadotropin secretion, contributing to anovulation and worsening the hormonal imbalance of PCOS."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs). Which mechanism explains how Bisphenol A (BPA) contributes to hyperandrogenism?",
            "options": [
                "BPA acts as a prebiotic that feeds androgen-producing bacteria",
                "BPA displaces androgens from Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), increasing free androgen levels",
                "BPA prevents the thyroid from absorbing iodine, which increases testosterone",
                "BPA destroys the insulin receptors on the surface of muscle cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA is known to bind to SHBG, displacing testosterone and increasing the circulating levels of free, biologically active androgens, which exacerbates PCOS symptoms."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "In Behavioral Change Psychology (Lesson 8), what is the 'Righting Reflex' and why should a coach avoid it?",
            "options": [
                "The urge to physically correct a patient's posture during an exam",
                "The coach's urge to fix a patient's problems by providing unsolicited advice, which often triggers resistance",
                "A neurological reflex that helps PCOS patients maintain balance during exercise",
                "The process of correcting a patient's laboratory results manually"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Righting Reflex' is the natural tendency of practitioners to want to 'fix' the patient. In Motivational Interviewing, this is discouraged because it often causes the patient to defend their current behavior (Sustain Talk) rather than moving toward change."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis mentioned in Lesson 5 compared N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) to Metformin. What was a key finding regarding NAC?",
            "options": [
                "NAC was found to be less effective than Metformin for weight loss",
                "NAC showed comparable results to Metformin in improving pregnancy rates and reducing BMI, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects",
                "NAC caused significant liver toxicity in 20% of the participants",
                "NAC was only effective if taken with high doses of Vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that NAC is a potent antioxidant and insulin sensitizer that performs similarly to Metformin in clinical outcomes like ovulation and pregnancy rates, but typically offers better gastrointestinal tolerability."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which 'Chrononutrition' strategy is most effective for improving the melatonin-insulin rhythm in PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "Eating the largest meal of the day within 1 hour of sleep",
                "Maintaining a consistent 12-hour fasting window and avoiding blue light 2 hours before bed",
                "Consuming high-protein snacks every 2 hours throughout the night",
                "Taking melatonin supplements immediately after a high-carb dinner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Avoiding late-night caloric intake and blue light helps preserve the melatonin surge, which is necessary for insulin sensitivity and oocyte quality. Melatonin and insulin have a reciprocal relationship; high insulin late at night can suppress melatonin."
