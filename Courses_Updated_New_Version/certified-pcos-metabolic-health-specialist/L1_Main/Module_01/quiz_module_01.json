            "question": "According to the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline, which of the following is required for a PCOS diagnosis in an adult woman under the Rotterdam Criteria?",
            "options": [
                "Only biochemical hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound",
                "At least two of: Ovulatory dysfunction, Hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), and PCO morphology",
                "Mandatory presence of insulin resistance and weight gain",
                "Presence of all three: Ovulatory dysfunction, Hyperandrogenism, and PCO morphology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rotterdam Criteria, currently the gold standard, requires at least two of the three main features: ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client presents with regular menstrual cycles and clinical hirsutism. Her ultrasound confirms polycystic ovary morphology. Which PCOS phenotype does she represent?",
            "options": [
                "Phenotype A (Classic)",
                "Phenotype B (Hyperandrogenic Anovulatory)",
                "Phenotype C (Ovulatory)",
                "Phenotype D (Non-Hyperandrogenic)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phenotype C (Ovulatory PCOS) consists of hyperandrogenism and PCOM, but with regular ovulatory cycles. This phenotype often presents with a lower metabolic risk profile than Phenotypes A or B."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When assessing hirsutism using the Modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score, what is the generally accepted threshold for clinical significance in most Caucasian and African American populations?",
            "options": [
                "A score of 2 or higher",
                "A score of 4 to 6 or higher",
                "A score of 12 or higher",
                "A score of 15 or higher"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While thresholds vary by ethnicity, most modern guidelines recognize a score of 4 to 6 or higher as indicative of clinical hirsutism in Caucasian and African American women."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Why is measuring Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) critical in a PCOS androgen panel?",
            "options": [
                "SHBG is an androgen produced by the adrenal glands",
                "SHBG converts testosterone into estrogen in the fat cells",
                "Low SHBG increases the amount of 'free' or bioavailable testosterone, even if total testosterone is normal",
                "High SHBG is a primary cause of cystic acne"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone in the blood. In PCOS, hyperinsulinemia often suppresses SHBG production in the liver, leading to higher levels of free (active) testosterone despite potentially normal 'total' levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A client's labs show a Fasting Glucose of 95 mg/dL and a Fasting Insulin of 18 µIU/mL. What is her HOMA-IR score, and how is it interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR 1.5; Within optimal range",
                "HOMA-IR 2.8; Suggestive of insulin resistance",
                "HOMA-IR 4.2; Suggestive of significant insulin resistance",
                "HOMA-IR 6.5; Diagnostic for Type 2 Diabetes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using the formula (Glucose x Insulin) / 405, the result is (95 x 18) / 405 = 4.22. A HOMA-IR score above 2.0 or 2.5 is generally considered indicative of insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which lipid marker ratio is considered a strong surrogate marker for insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk in PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol / LDL ratio",
                "Triglyceride / HDL ratio",
                "HDL / LDL ratio",
                "VLDL / Triglyceride ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A TG/HDL ratio >3.0 (in mg/dL) is highly correlated with insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles, which are more atherogenic."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "To rule out Non-Classic Adrenal Hyperplasia (NCAH), which lab marker should be tested during the early follicular phase?",
            "options": [
                "DHEA-S",
                "Androstenedione",
                "17-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP)",
                "Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "17-OHP is the primary screening marker for NCAH. A value <200 ng/dL (6 nmol/L) generally rules out the condition, while higher values require further ACTH stimulation testing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Rule-Out' condition that can mimic the symptoms of PCOS by causing both amenorrhea and elevated androgens?",
            "options": [
                "Hypothyroidism",
                "Hyperprolactinemia",
                "Cushing's Syndrome",
                "All of the above"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Thyroid disorders, elevated prolactin, and Cushing's Syndrome can all cause ovulatory dysfunction and/or androgenic symptoms and must be ruled out before confirming a PCOS diagnosis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Phenotype D (Non-Hyperandrogenic PCOS) is often the most controversial. What characterizes this specific group?",
            "options": [
                "Hirsutism and high testosterone, but regular cycles",
                "Ovulatory dysfunction and PCO morphology, but NO clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism",
                "High insulin and weight gain, but clear skin and regular cycles",
                "Extreme hirsutism and anovulation with normal ovaries on ultrasound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phenotype D consists of individuals who meet the criteria for ovulatory dysfunction and PCOM, but lack evidence of hyperandrogenism. This group typically has the lowest metabolic risk."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "During the 'Synthesizing the S-Phase' process, what is the primary goal of the 'Client Baseline'?",
            "options": [
                "To determine which pharmaceutical medication to prescribe first",
                "To categorize the client into a phenotype and identify their unique metabolic and symptomatic drivers",
                "To prove to the client that they have a permanent disease",
                "To replace the need for a medical doctor's diagnosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' Phase (Symptom & Lab Screening) aims to build a comprehensive baseline that identifies the client's specific phenotype and metabolic drivers (like IR or inflammation) to tailor the subsequent 'P', 'E', and 'C' phases."
