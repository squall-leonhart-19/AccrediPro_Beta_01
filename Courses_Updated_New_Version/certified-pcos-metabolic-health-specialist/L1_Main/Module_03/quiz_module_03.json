            "question": "Chronic cortisol elevation in PCOS clients primarily drives metabolic dysfunction through which of the following mechanisms?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulating the conversion of testosterone to estrogen in adipose tissue",
                "Increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and promoting visceral adiposity while worsening insulin resistance",
                "Directly inhibiting the production of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) in the pituitary",
                "Decreasing the production of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) in the kidneys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol triggers the liver to produce more glucose (gluconeogenesis) and promotes the storage of fat in the visceral region, which directly exacerbates insulin resistance, a core driver of PCOS symptoms."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A 'Luteal Phase Defect' (LPD), common in PCOS due to poor follicular development, is clinically defined by a luteal phase duration of fewer than how many days?",
            "options": [
                "14 days",
                "12 days",
                "10 days",
                "7 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase of 10 days or fewer is considered insufficient to support the implantation of a fertilized egg and is a hallmark of progesterone deficiency often seen in PCOS."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In 'Subclinical Hypothyroidism' (SCH), which is prevalent in PCOS, what is the typical biochemical finding?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated TSH with normal Free T4 levels",
                "Low TSH with low Free T4 levels",
                "Elevated TSH with low Free T4 levels",
                "Normal TSH with elevated Reverse T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Subclinical Hypothyroidism is characterized by a TSH level above the reference range (often >2.5 or 4.0 mIU/L depending on guidelines) while the actual thyroid hormone (Free T4) remains within the normal laboratory range."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Insulin acts as a co-gonadotropin in the ovaries. Specifically, it works synergistically with which hormone to stimulate theca cell androgen production?",
            "options": [
                "Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Progesterone",
                "Prolactin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin enhances the response of ovarian theca cells to LH, leading to an overproduction of androgens (testosterone and androstenedione)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "According to the science of circadian rhythms in PCOS, why is 'blue light' exposure at night particularly detrimental to hormonal pulsatility?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the half-life of insulin in the bloodstream",
                "It suppresses melatonin, which acts as a vital antioxidant for oocyte quality within the follicle",
                "It directly stimulates the ovaries to produce more testosterone",
                "It prevents the kidneys from excreting excess estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin is not just for sleep; it is found in high concentrations in follicular fluid where it protects the egg from oxidative damage. Nighttime blue light suppresses melatonin, disrupting this protective mechanism."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "The 'LH Surge' is the trigger for ovulation. In a healthy endocrine response, how many hours after the start of the LH surge does ovulation typically occur?",
            "options": [
                "2–4 hours",
                "10–12 hours",
                "24–36 hours",
                "72–96 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ovulation generally occurs 24 to 36 hours after the onset of the LH surge, or about 10-12 hours after the LH peak."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client's lab work shows a 3:1 ratio of LH to FSH. What is the most likely physiological consequence of this endocrine imbalance?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid follicular maturation and twin pregnancies",
                "Premature ovarian failure",
                "Stalled follicular development and failure to reach dominance (ovulation)",
                "Excessive progesterone production in the follicular phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An elevated LH:FSH ratio (2:1 or 3:1) is a classic PCOS marker where the high LH stimulates androgens while the relatively low FSH is insufficient to mature a follicle to the point of ovulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "When monitoring Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a metric for HPA-axis resilience, what does a consistently *low* RMSSD value indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A state of parasympathetic dominance (rest and digest)",
                "High cardiovascular fitness and excellent recovery",
                "A state of sympathetic dominance and reduced adaptive capacity to stress",
                "Optimal endocrine alignment and low cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low HRV (specifically the RMSSD metric) indicates that the body is stuck in a 'fight or flight' (sympathetic) state, suggesting poor stress resilience and potential HPA-axis dysregulation."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client presents with adult acne and hirsutism. Her labs show high DHEA-S but normal Total Testosterone and normal fasting insulin. What is the most likely driver of her hyperandrogenism?",
            "options": [
                "Ovarian overproduction driven by insulin",
                "Adrenal hyperandrogenism driven by HPA-axis activation",
                "Thyroid peroxidase antibodies",
                "Excessive intake of dietary fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHEA-S is produced almost exclusively by the adrenal glands. High DHEA-S with normal testosterone and insulin points toward the 'Adrenal PCOS' phenotype rather than the insulin-driven ovarian phenotype."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) is often significantly elevated in PCOS. What is the functional impact of excess AMH on the follicular cycle?",
            "options": [
                "It causes follicles to disappear too quickly (early menopause)",
                "It inhibits the recruitment of primordial follicles and reduces the follicles' sensitivity to FSH",
                "It triggers the LH surge prematurely",
                "It converts progesterone into testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High AMH levels in PCOS act as a 'brake' on the system, inhibiting the transition of follicles into later stages and making them less responsive to FSH, which contributes to the 'string of pearls' (arrested follicles) seen on ultrasound."
