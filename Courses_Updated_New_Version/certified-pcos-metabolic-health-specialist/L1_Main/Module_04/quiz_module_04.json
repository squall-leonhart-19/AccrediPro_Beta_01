            "question": "Why is skeletal muscle referred to as the 'metabolic sink' in the context of PCOS and insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "It is the primary site for insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, accounting for up to 80% of clearance.",
                "It stores excess circulating androgens and converts them into estrogen.",
                "It is the only tissue capable of producing cortisol during periods of caloric deficit.",
                "It acts as a reservoir for inflammatory cytokines that trigger ovulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Skeletal muscle is responsible for approximately 70-80% of whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, making it the most critical 'sink' for managing blood sugar in PCOS."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Resistance training is considered the 'Gold Standard' for PCOS because it directly increases the expression of which glucose transporter protein?",
            "options": [
                "GLUT1",
                "GLUT4",
                "SGLT2",
                "GLUT5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance training increases the expression and translocation of GLUT4, the primary protein responsible for transporting glucose into muscle cells, thereby bypassing some insulin resistance mechanisms."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on NEAT, what is the typical range of energy expenditure that Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis can contribute to Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Exactly 10% for all individuals",
                "15% to 50% depending on lifestyle",
                "70% to 90% in sedentary individuals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NEAT is highly variable and can account for 15% to 50% of TDEE, often providing a greater metabolic impact than a structured 45-minute gym session."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A client with PCOS and high adrenal androgens reports feeling 'wired but tired' and experiences insomnia after evening HIIT sessions. What is the likely physiological cause?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive depletion of glycogen stores",
                "A prolonged elevation of the cortisol response overriding the natural melatonin rise",
                "Inadequate protein intake prior to the workout",
                "The 'afterburn' effect increasing core temperature too much for sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-intensity exercise can cause a significant cortisol spike; if performed too late or too intensely for the client's current stress load, it can disrupt the circadian rhythm and inhibit melatonin."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "During the follicular phase (post-menstruation), how should a coach typically program exercise intensity for an ovulatory PCOS client?",
            "options": [
                "Focus exclusively on restorative yoga to prevent cortisol spikes",
                "This is the optimal time for higher intensity or heavy lifting due to rising estrogen and insulin sensitivity",
                "Complete rest is required to allow the follicle to develop",
                "Intensity should be at its lowest point of the entire month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the follicular phase, estrogen rises and insulin sensitivity is generally higher, making the body more resilient to higher intensity work and better at utilizing carbohydrates for fuel."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "The '10-Minute Glucose Hack' (post-prandial movement) is most effective at flattening the glucose curve when performed within what timeframe after a meal?",
            "options": [
                "5 minutes before the meal starts",
                "Within 30 minutes of finishing the meal",
                "Exactly 2 hours after the meal",
                "Immediately before going to sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Walking within 30 minutes of a meal utilizes the glucose as it enters the bloodstream, activating insulin-independent glucose uptake through muscle contraction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which post-prandial walking lowers blood glucose without requiring high levels of insulin?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the kidneys to excrete glucose",
                "It triggers muscle-contraction-induced GLUT4 translocation",
                "It causes the stomach to stop absorbing carbohydrates",
                "It increases the production of alpha-cells in the pancreas"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Muscle contractions during light activity like walking trigger the movement of GLUT4 to the cell surface independently of insulin, allowing for effective glucose clearance."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "When managing 'Exercise Resistance' in a client with PCOS-related fatigue, which approach is most likely to improve mitochondrial function over time?",
            "options": [
                "Daily high-volume fasted cardio",
                "Short, frequent 'movement snacks' and zone 2 activity to build aerobic base",
                "Pushing through the fatigue to 'break' the metabolic plateau",
                "Eliminating all movement until the client feels 100% recovered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-intensity 'movement snacks' and Zone 2 training support mitochondrial biogenesis without overtaxing the HPA-axis, which is essential for overcoming exercise resistance."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In the 'A' Protocol Integration, which of the following is considered a 'Red Flag' that the current activity plan is too aggressive for the client's metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "Increased energy levels in the afternoon",
                "A decrease in cravings for sugary foods",
                "Resting Heart Rate (RHR) trending upward by 5-10 bpm over a week",
                "Mild muscle soreness (DOMS) that resolves within 24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A rising trend in Resting Heart Rate (RHR) is a key indicator of autonomic nervous system strain and poor recovery, suggesting the exercise volume or intensity is too high."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which specific benefit does resistance training provide for the 'Hormonal' component of PCOS beyond just glucose management?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), which helps lower free testosterone",
                "It destroys androgen receptors in the skin to stop hirsutism",
                "It converts all circulating testosterone into progesterone",
                "It prevents the pituitary gland from releasing LH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "By improving insulin sensitivity and reducing hyperinsulinemia, resistance training helps the liver increase the production of SHBG, which binds to excess testosterone and reduces symptoms like acne and hair growth."
