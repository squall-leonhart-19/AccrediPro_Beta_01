            "question": "High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) is a primary marker for systemic inflammation. In PCOS populations, what level of hs-CRP is typically indicative of the 'chronic low-grade inflammation' that drives insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Lower than 0.5 mg/L",
                "Between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/L",
                "Greater than 3.0 mg/L",
                "Only levels above 10.0 mg/L are relevant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the context of PCOS and metabolic health, an hs-CRP level greater than 3.0 mg/L is widely recognized as a marker for chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, which contributes to theca cell hyperplasia and insulin receptor desensitization."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which specific mechanism explains how Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) like Bisphenol A (BPA) exacerbate PCOS symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the clearance rate of testosterone in the liver",
                "They bind to estrogen receptors and displace natural estrogen, while simultaneously stimulating androgen production in theca cells",
                "They decrease the sensitivity of the pituitary gland to GnRH",
                "They promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria that metabolize fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA is structurally similar to estrogen and can bind to estrogen receptors. Crucially for PCOS, studies show BPA directly stimulates theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess androgens, worsening hyperandrogenism."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "Metabolic Endotoxemia occurs when Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) cross the gut barrier. Which receptor does LPS bind to on immune cells to trigger the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade in PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1)",
                "Glut-4 Transporter",
                "Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4)",
                "PPAR-gamma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria) bind to Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) on macrophages and other immune cells, triggering the release of NF-κB and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "In Phase II Liver Detoxification, which pathway is specifically responsible for neutralizing the 'catechol estrogens' (2-OH and 4-OH) to prevent DNA damage and oxidative stress?",
            "options": [
                "Sulfation",
                "Methylation (via COMT enzyme)",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Acetylation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methylation, facilitated by the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, is the critical Phase II pathway for neutralizing catechol estrogens, converting them into water-soluble methoxyestrogens for excretion."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "A client presents with an Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio of 18:1. According to anti-inflammatory nutrition strategies for PCOS, what is the optimal target ratio to reduce systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "10:1",
                "1:1 to 4:1",
                "25:1",
                "Ratios do not matter as long as total fat is low"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Western diet often reaches ratios of 15:1 or 20:1. For PCOS management and inflammation control, the goal is to bring the ratio down to between 1:1 and 4:1 by increasing EPA/DHA intake and reducing processed seed oils."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Mitochondrial dysfunction in PCOS is characterized by an overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Why is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) more susceptible to this damage than nuclear DNA?",
            "options": [
                "mtDNA is larger and harder to repair",
                "mtDNA lacks protective histones and is located in close proximity to the site of ROS production",
                "mtDNA is only inherited from the father",
                "mtDNA is protected by a double-layer of cholesterol that oxidizes easily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mitochondrial DNA lacks the protective histone proteins found in nuclear DNA and is located right next to the electron transport chain, where ROS are generated, making it highly vulnerable to oxidative stress."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "When implementing a 'Low-Tox Lifestyle,' which intervention has been shown in clinical trials to reduce urinary Phthalate and BPA metabolites by over 60% in as little as three days?",
            "options": [
                "Switching to an all-liquid juice cleanse",
                "Taking high doses of activated charcoal",
                "Replacing all plastic food storage and canned goods with fresh, whole foods stored in glass or stainless steel",
                "Using an infrared sauna for 20 minutes daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Rudel et al.) has demonstrated that moving from a diet high in packaged/canned foods to a fresh, whole-food diet significantly reduces the body burden of BPA and Phthalates within 72 hours."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Which laboratory marker is considered the most sensitive indicator of glutathione depletion and oxidative stress in the liver for a client with PCOS and NAFLD?",
            "options": [
                "ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)",
                "AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)",
                "GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)",
                "Total Bilirubin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While ALT and AST indicate liver cell damage, GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase) is often the first to rise in response to oxidative stress and the demand for glutathione, making it a key marker for monitoring the 'D' pillar."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to a subset of the gut microbiome. What enzyme do these bacteria produce that can deconjugate estrogens, leading to their reabsorption into the bloodstream?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Lipase",
                "Protease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-clips' the glucuronic acid from conjugated estrogen, allowing the 'active' estrogen to be reabsorbed (enterohepatic circulation) instead of excreted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'estrogen dominance' symptoms and poor Phase II clearance. Which cruciferous-derived compound supports the liver by inducing Phase II enzymes and promoting the 2-OH (protective) estrogen pathway?",
            "options": [
                "Resveratrol",
                "Sulforaphane / Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C)",
                "Quercetin",
                "Berberine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane and I3C (which breaks down into DIM) are potent inducers of Phase II detoxification enzymes and help shift estrogen metabolism toward the more favorable 2-hydroxyestrone pathway."
