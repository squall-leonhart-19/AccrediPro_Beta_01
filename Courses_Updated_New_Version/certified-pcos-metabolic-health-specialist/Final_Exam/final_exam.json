        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "According to the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Method™, what is the primary objective of the 'S' (Symptom & Lab Screening) phase before proceeding to nutritional interventions?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the specific PCOS phenotype and establish baseline metabolic markers like HOMA-IR and androgen levels.",
                "To prescribe specific pharmaceutical interventions for ovulation induction.",
                "To determine the client's caloric deficit requirements for rapid weight loss.",
                "To eliminate all carbohydrates from the client's diet based on their blood type."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'S' in the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Method™ stands for Symptom & Lab Screening. Its purpose is to identify the unique PCOS phenotype (e.g., Insulin Resistant, Adrenal, Inflammatory, or Post-Pill) and establish metabolic baselines such as HOMA-IR (Fasting Insulin x Fasting Glucose / 405) to tailor the subsequent steps."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a Fasting Insulin of 18 uIU/mL and a Fasting Glucose of 95 mg/dL. What is her HOMA-IR score, and how is it interpreted in the context of PCOS metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR 1.8; considered metabolically healthy and within optimal range.",
                "HOMA-IR 4.22; indicating significant insulin resistance and a high risk for metabolic dysfunction.",
                "HOMA-IR 2.5; indicating moderate insulin sensitivity with no need for intervention.",
                "HOMA-IR 0.8; indicating possible hypoglycemia and adrenal insufficiency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR is calculated as (Insulin x Glucose) / 405. (18 x 95) / 405 = 4.22. In PCOS management, a HOMA-IR above 2.0 is often considered early insulin resistance, and above 2.5 is significant. A score of 4.22 indicates high hyperinsulinemia driving androgen production."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "In the 'T' (Therapeutic Glucose Tuning) phase, which nutritional strategy is most effective for reducing the post-prandial insulin spike that triggers ovarian androgen production?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming a high-fructose fruit-only breakfast to 'jumpstart' the metabolism.",
                "Implementing 'food sequencing' by consuming fiber, then protein/fats, and carbohydrates last.",
                "Reducing total daily calories to under 800 per day regardless of macronutrient composition.",
                "Increasing meal frequency to 6-8 small snacks per day to keep insulin constantly elevated."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic Glucose Tuning focuses on stabilizing blood sugar. Food sequencing (fiber first, then protein/fats, then complex carbs) significantly reduces the glucose and insulin excursion of a meal, which is critical because hyperinsulinemia directly stimulates theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess testosterone."

        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "The 'E' (Endocrine System Alignment) phase addresses HPA axis dysfunction. How does chronic cortisol elevation specifically exacerbate PCOS symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), lowering free testosterone.",
                "It suppresses the production of insulin, leading to Type 1 Diabetes.",
                "It promotes gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance while potentially increasing adrenal androgen (DHEA-S) production.",
                "It has no effect on PCOS as PCOS is strictly an ovarian disorder."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Endocrine System Alignment recognizes the HPA axis's role. Elevated cortisol triggers the liver to release glucose (gluconeogenesis), which raises insulin. Furthermore, about 20-30% of PCOS patients have 'Adrenal PCOS,' where the HPA axis drives excess DHEA-S production."

        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "Under the 'A' (Activity & Muscle Activation) protocol, why is resistance training prioritized over high-intensity steady-state (HISS) cardio for PCOS clients?",
            "options": [
                "Resistance training decreases the number of insulin receptors on the muscle cell.",
                "Resistance training increases GLUT4 translocation and muscle mass, providing a larger 'sink' for glucose disposal.",
                "PCOS clients are physically unable to perform cardiovascular exercise due to hormonal imbalances.",
                "Cardio causes an immediate and permanent shutdown of the thyroid gland."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Activity & Muscle Activation emphasizes resistance training because skeletal muscle is responsible for ~80% of insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Increasing muscle mass and stimulating GLUT4 transporters through resistance training improves systemic insulin sensitivity more effectively than excessive cardio, which can sometimes overstress the HPA axis."

            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "The 'D' (Detoxification & Inflammation Control) phase focuses on Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs). Which mechanism explains how Bisphenol A (BPA) worsens PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "BPA acts as an estrogen mimetic and has been correlated with higher androgen levels and insulin resistance in PCOS populations.",
                "BPA increases the body's ability to clear excess testosterone through the kidneys.",
                "BPA strengthens the intestinal barrier, preventing 'leaky gut'.",
                "BPA is a necessary nutrient for progesterone synthesis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phase 'D' addresses environmental factors. Research (e.g., Kandaraki et al.) shows that women with PCOS have higher serum BPA levels, which can interfere with hormone receptor signaling, exacerbate insulin resistance, and contribute to the inflammatory state of the disorder."

            "id": "final_7",
            "question": "In the 'Y' (Yielding Lasting Vitality) phase, which 'bio-feedback' markers are most indicative of successful long-term metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "Daily weight fluctuations of 3-5 pounds.",
                "Stable energy levels between meals, regular ovulatory cycles, and reduced hirsutism growth rate.",
                "The ability to fast for 48 hours without any hunger signals.",
                "A total cessation of all sweating during exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yielding Lasting Vitality is about sustainability. Success is measured by the remission of symptoms (regular cycles, improved skin/hair) and metabolic flexibility—the body's ability to switch between fuel sources without energy crashes or intense cravings."

        {
            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "According to the Rotterdam Criteria, a diagnosis of PCOS requires at least two of the following three: (1) Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, (2) Hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), and what third criteria?",
            "options": [
                "Documented Insulin Resistance via HOMA-IR.",
                "Oligo-ovulation or Anovulation (irregular or absent periods).",
                "Presence of Acanthosis Nigricans.",
                "Elevated Cortisol levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rotterdam Criteria (2003) remain the international diagnostic standard, requiring 2 of 3: 1. Irregular/absent ovulation, 2. High androgens (blood tests or symptoms like acne/hirsutism), and 3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (≥12-20 follicles)."

            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis suggests that women with PCOS have a significantly higher prevalence of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). What is the estimated prevalence range in this population?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-20%",
                "35-45%",
                "85-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the high overlap of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, NAFLD is highly prevalent in PCOS clients, with studies estimating between 35% and 45% (and higher in obese phenotypes), necessitating the 'D' (Detoxification) focus on liver health."

            "question": "When working with a complex client who has both PCOS and Hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's), what must a Specialist prioritize according to the STEADY methodology?",
            "options": [
                "Ignoring the thyroid and focusing only on weight loss.",
                "Ensuring the client is working with an endocrinologist for thyroid medication while the Specialist supports metabolic health and inflammation reduction.",
                "Prescribing a high-iodine supplement protocol without medical supervision.",
                "Telling the client to stop their thyroid medication to 'heal naturally'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical considerations (M22) and complex scenarios (M17) dictate that Specialists work within their scope. Thyroid dysfunction mimics and exacerbates PCOS; therefore, medical management of the thyroid is essential while the Specialist applies the STEADY method to support underlying metabolic drivers."

            "id": "final_11",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'LH:FSH Ratio' often seen in the 'S' (Symptom & Lab Screening) phase for a classic PCOS phenotype?",
            "options": [
                "LH is significantly lower than FSH (1:3 ratio).",
                "LH and FSH are both zero.",
                "LH is often elevated relative to FSH, frequently appearing in a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio.",
                "FSH is always above 40 mIU/mL."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In many PCOS cases, the pituitary gland pulses Luteinizing Hormone (LH) at a higher frequency/amplitude, leading to an elevated LH to Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) ratio, which interferes with follicle maturation and ovulation."

            "id": "final_12",
            "question": "In Module 33 (Legal & Compliance), which document is essential before beginning a STEADY Method™ intervention to clarify that the coach is not a medical doctor?",
            "options": [
                "A Marketing Release Form.",
                "A Medical Disclaimer and Informed Consent Agreement.",
                "A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).",
                "A Credit Application."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To protect the practitioner and the client, a Medical Disclaimer and Informed Consent must be signed. It explicitly states that the Specialist provides educational and lifestyle support, not medical diagnosis or treatment, maintaining legal compliance."

            "id": "final_13",
            "question": "During the 'T' (Therapeutic Glucose Tuning) phase, what is the significance of Myo-Inositol supplementation (at a 40:1 ratio with D-Chiro-Inositol)?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a sedative to help the client sleep.",
                "It serves as a second messenger for insulin signaling, helping to improve insulin sensitivity and oocyte quality.",
                "It is a stimulant that increases heart rate for fat burning.",
                "It is a synthetic hormone that replaces progesterone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myo-inositol is one of the most researched supplements for PCOS. It improves the body's response to insulin (insulin signaling) and is crucial for the maturation of the egg (oocyte) within the follicle."

            "options": [
                "Because gut bacteria produce testosterone.",
                "Because dysbiosis can lead to increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut), triggering systemic inflammation that worsens insulin resistance.",
                "Because the gut is the only place where calories are absorbed.",
                "Because a healthy gut prevents the need for any exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'PCOS-Gut Axis' suggests that dysbiosis leads to the translocation of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the bloodstream. This triggers an immune response and chronic low-grade inflammation, which directly impairs insulin receptor sensitivity."

                "Immediately going back on the pill.",
                "Supporting the body through the temporary androgen surge and nutrient depletions (like Zinc and B6) caused by the pill.",
                "Doing 2 hours of HIIT daily to sweat out the synthetic hormones.",
                "Restricting all fats to lower cholesterol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-Pill PCOS occurs as the body resumes its own hormone production after suppression. The focus is on clearing synthetic hormones, replenishing depleted nutrients (Zinc, B vitamins, Magnesium), and managing the temporary rebound in androgens."
