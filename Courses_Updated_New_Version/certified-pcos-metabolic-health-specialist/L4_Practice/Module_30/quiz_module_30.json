            "question": "When defining a PCOS brand identity (L1), why is 'micro-niching' (e.g., focusing specifically on PCOS-related primary infertility) considered a strategic advantage?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the specialist to charge lower fees to attract more volume",
                "It reduces the need for clinical knowledge because the scope is narrower",
                "It positions the specialist as a 'Category of One,' reducing direct competition and increasing perceived authority",
                "It eliminates the need for a referral network since the niche is so specific"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-niching allows a specialist to dominate a specific segment of the market, making them the go-to expert for that specific problem, which naturally commands higher authority and less competition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adjusting medication dosages is the practice of medicine. Specialists may educate on medications but must never prescribe or alter dosages; this must be handled by the client's physician."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Educational marketing, particularly on complex physiological topics, serves to establish the specialist's expertise and clinical competence, moving the lead from 'aware' to 'trusting.'"

                "End the call immediately as they are not a 'high-quality' lead"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a consultative model, overcoming objections involves helping the client weigh the investment against the long-term metabolic risks (diabetes, infertility, etc.) of remaining in their current state."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "question": "A specialist is designing the 'Signature S.T.E.A.D.Y. Program' (L3). Why is it recommended to include 'Non-Scale Victories' (NSVs) in the tracking system?",
            "options": [
                "Because weight loss in PCOS is often slow due to insulin resistance, and NSVs (like improved energy or cycles) maintain client motivation",
                "Because weight doesn't matter at all in metabolic health",
                "To avoid using a scale, which is legally required in most states",
                "To make the program seem easier than it actually is"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PCOS clients often struggle with slow weight loss due to metabolic dysfunction. Tracking NSVs ensures they recognize the internal physiological improvements (insulin sensitivity, hormonal balance) even when the scale is stagnant."
