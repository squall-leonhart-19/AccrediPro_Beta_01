            "question": "In the context of PCOS group dynamics, what is the primary benefit of 'Universalism' within a cohort?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the facilitator to spend less time on individual questions.",
                "It reduces the 'shame-secrecy' cycle by showing participants they are not alone in their symptoms.",
                "It ensures that every participant follows the exact same supplement protocol.",
                "It eliminates the need for HIPAA-compliant communication platforms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universalism is a core psychological benefit of group work where participants realize their struggles (like hirsutism or infertility) are shared, significantly reducing the isolation and shame often associated with PCOS."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maintain privacy and adhere to professional standards, facilitators should use de-identified data or 'proxy' cases to teach the group how to read their own labs without exposing private health information (PHI)."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "In a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) cohort, a participant experiences a 'glucose comparison trap,' feeling discouraged because her peaks are higher than others. What is the facilitator's best response?",
            "options": [
                "Advise her to eat exactly what the person with the lowest peaks is eating.",
                "Explain that metabolic bio-individuality means her 'normal' range is unique to her insulin sensitivity and HPA axis state.",
                "Tell her she is likely 'cheating' on her diet and needs more discipline.",
                "Remove her from the group to prevent her from discouraging others."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Facilitating 'Group Glucose Tuning' requires emphasizing bio-individuality; factors like muscle mass, sleep, and stress (HPA axis) mean two people can react differently to the same carbohydrate source."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Inflammation Audit assesses whether the group's exercise habits are triggering an HPA-axis flare or systemic inflammation, which is critical for PCOS patients who may struggle with recovery."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "According to the module, 'Co-regulation' in a workshop setting refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The facilitator using their own regulated nervous system to help calm the collective HPA axis of the group.",
                "Participants checking each other's blood pressure during the session.",
                "A legal requirement to have two facilitators present at all times.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation is a physiological process where the facilitator's calm presence and tone help stabilize the nervous systems of participants, especially important when discussing stressful topics like infertility."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Yield' represents the immediate value or actionable outcome a participant gains from a single session, ensuring they feel the program is worth their time and investment."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "When managing 'Group Resistance' (Lesson 7), a participant consistently derails the conversation with 'What about...' questions. This is often a sign of:",
            "options": [
                "High intelligence and engagement.",
                "An overactive HPA axis seeking certainty as a safety mechanism.",

                "Poor curriculum design."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In PCOS care, 'information seeking' can sometimes be a trauma response or a sign of HPA axis dysregulation where the participant is trying to find 'the one perfect answer' to feel safe."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "From a business scaling perspective (Lesson 8), what is the 'Hybrid Model' of group programming?",
            "options": [
                "Mixing PCOS patients with menopausal patients in the same group.",
                "Combining pre-recorded curriculum (asynchronous) with live group coaching (synchronous).",
                "Selling both supplements and coaching at the same time.",
                "Offering the program for free but charging for the lab tests."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid Model uses a 'flipped classroom' approach where participants watch lessons on their own time and use the live sessions for high-value coaching and integration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For PCOS and metabolic health, 'Next Day Recovery' is a superior metric to weight loss or intensity, as it indicates the movement is supporting rather than stressing the endocrine system."
