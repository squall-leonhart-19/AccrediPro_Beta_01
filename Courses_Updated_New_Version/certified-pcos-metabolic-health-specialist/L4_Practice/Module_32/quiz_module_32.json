            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing aligns the specialist's incentives with the client's goals. By pricing based on the transformation (e.g., successfully conceiving or reversing metabolic syndrome), the perceived ROI is significantly higher than an hourly rate."
