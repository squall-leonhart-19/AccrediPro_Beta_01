            "question": "According to Lesson 1 on High-Ticket Positioning, why is a 'low-cost, high-volume' business model often detrimental to both the PCOS specialist and the client?",
            "options": [
                "PCOS clients require less time and can be managed in bulk sessions.",
                "Low-cost models lack the margin to provide the deep-dive functional testing and personalized support necessary for complex PCOS phenotypes.",
                "High-ticket models are only used for vanity branding and do not impact clinical outcomes.",
                "PCOS clients generally prefer self-guided courses over high-touch coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PCOS is a complex endocrine disorder that requires bio-individualized attention. High-ticket positioning provides the financial margin for the specialist to spend the necessary time on lab analysis and lifestyle coaching to ensure client success."

                "To strictly share personal anecdotes without scientific backing.",
                "To establish clinical expertise by solving a specific sub-problem (e.g., insulin resistance) while building trust through evidence-based education.",
                "To hide all valuable information behind a paywall to force a discovery call."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pillar content serves to demonstrate authority by providing high-value, evidence-based solutions to specific PCOS symptoms, which positions the specialist as the 'go-to' expert for that condition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reproductive Endocrinologists often work with PCOS patients struggling with infertility. A specialist can provide the nutritional and lifestyle support that REIs typically do not have time to manage, creating a symbiotic referral loop."

                "To calculate the exact number of calories the client needs to eat during the call.",
                "To compare the specialist's prices with those of local competitors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gap Analysis helps the client realize that their current trajectory will not lead to their goals, making the specialist's program the logical bridge to help them cross that 'gap'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid Model allows for scalability by using a digital curriculum for standard education while maintaining high-value group and 1:1 support for specific clinical needs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using words like 'cure' or 'guarantee' for a chronic condition like PCOS is a major compliance violation. Specialists must use 'structure/function' claims rather than 'disease' claims."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
