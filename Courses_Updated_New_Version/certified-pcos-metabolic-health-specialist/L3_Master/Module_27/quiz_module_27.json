            "question": "When distinguishing between PCOS and Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) in a high-performance athlete with amenorrhea, which hormonal profile is most indicative of RED-S?",
            "options": [
                "Low LH, low FSH, and low estradiol",
                "High LH, normal FSH, and elevated testosterone",
                "Elevated Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) and high LH",
                "Normal Prolactin and elevated DHEAS"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "RED-S is characterized by functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, resulting in low gonadotropins (LH/FSH) and low estradiol due to energy deficiency, whereas PCOS typically presents with elevated LH and androgens."

        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "In the menopause transition, how does the PCOS phenotype typically shift regarding androgen levels compared to women without PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Androgen levels rise significantly higher than pre-menopausal levels",
                "Androgen levels drop to zero immediately upon the final menstrual period",
                "Androgens remain higher than age-matched peers, though they decline from pre-menopausal levels",
                "PCOS symptoms completely resolve and metabolic risk disappears"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While androgens decline with age in all women, those with PCOS maintain higher testosterone and androstenedione levels than age-matched controls, contributing to ongoing metabolic risks post-menopause."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "According to clinical data discussed in the module, pregnant individuals with PCOS have approximately how many times the risk of developing Gestational Diabetes (GDM) compared to those without PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 times the risk",
                "3 times the risk",
                "5 times the risk",
                "10 times the risk"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses indicate that PCOS confers a 3-fold increased risk for GDM, necessitating early screening and proactive glucose management during pregnancy."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Which autoimmune condition shows the strongest prevalence link with PCOS, appearing in approximately 18-27% of PCOS patients?",
            "options": [

                "Rheumatoid Arthritis",
                "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis",
                "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is significantly more common in the PCOS population (3 times the prevalence of the general population), requiring regular TSH and TPO antibody monitoring."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Why do international guidelines recommend waiting at least 2 years post-menarche before diagnosing PCOS in adolescents using the Rotterdam Criteria?",
            "options": [
                "Androgens are not produced by the body until age 16",
                "Irregular cycles and multi-follicular ovaries are normal physiological features of puberty",
                "Insulin resistance only develops after the age of 18",
                "Adolescents cannot accurately report their symptoms until adulthood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the first two years post-menarche, anovulatory cycles and 'polycystic' appearing ovaries are common developmental stages, which can lead to over-diagnosis if adult criteria are applied too early."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "For a client with both PCOS and ADHD, which 'Executive Function' challenge is most likely to interfere with their metabolic nutrition plan?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-focusing on exercise",
                "Enhanced memory for supplement schedules",
                "Difficulty with meal planning, initiation, and impulse control",
                "Excessive thirst leading to over-hydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Executive dysfunction in ADHD makes multi-step tasks like meal prepping, remembering to eat consistently, and resisting impulsive food choices significantly more difficult for PCOS management."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "When applying a trauma-informed approach to PCOS and Disordered Eating, what is the primary concern with recommending restrictive 'elimination diets'?",
            "options": [
                "They are too expensive for most clients",
                "They can trigger the 'binge-restrict' cycle and exacerbate Binge Eating Disorder (BED)",
                "They prevent the absorption of Myo-inositol",
                "They cause a permanent decrease in metabolic rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In individuals with a history of disordered eating or trauma, restrictive diets often trigger a psychological and physiological 'rebound' effect, leading to increased binge frequency and psychological distress."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "Which phenotypic characteristic is most commonly observed in East Asian populations with PCOS compared to Caucasian populations?",
            "options": [
                "Higher rates of obesity and higher BMI at diagnosis",
                "Lower risk of cardiovascular disease",
                "Metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance at a lower BMI ('Lean PCOS')",
                "Complete absence of hirsutism regardless of androgen levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "East Asian phenotypes often present with 'Lean PCOS,' where significant metabolic disturbances and insulin resistance occur at lower BMI thresholds than those typically seen in Western populations."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "What is a primary physiological reason why individuals with PCOS may experience lower milk supply or delayed lactogenesis II in the postpartum period?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive oxytocin production",
                "Low levels of progesterone during pregnancy",
                "Insulin resistance interfering with mammary gland development and prolactin sensitivity",
                "PCOS patients are unable to produce prolactin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin is a 'master switch' for lactation; insulin resistance, combined with high androgens, can interfere with the final stages of mammary tissue development and the signaling required for robust milk production."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A 15-year-old adolescent presents with irregular cycles (3 years post-menarche) and clinical hirsutism. What is the first-line recommendation for management according to pediatric guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate bariatric surgery",
                "Lifestyle modifications including nutrition and physical activity",
                "High-dose spironolactone and Metformin",
                "Strict 1200-calorie diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lifestyle modifications (nutrition, sleep, and activity) remain the first-line intervention for adolescents, focusing on metabolic health and symptom management before escalating to pharmacological interventions."
