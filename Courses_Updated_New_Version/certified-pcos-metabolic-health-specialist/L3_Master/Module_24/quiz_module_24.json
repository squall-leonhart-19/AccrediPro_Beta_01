            "id": "q24_1",
            "question": "In the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Diagnostic Matrix, which element is specifically focused on interpreting functional lab results against optimal rather than standard reference ranges?",
            "options": ["Stress Load", "Environmental Toxins", "Yield (Functional Analysis)", "Adrenal Response"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Y' in the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Matrix stands for Yield, which focuses on the functional analysis of lab data to identify subclinical imbalances before they progress to pathology."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner identifies a client with a fasting insulin of 14 mIU/L. While the lab's 'normal' range goes up to 24.9 mIU/L, what is the Master Practitioner's functional interpretation?",
            "options": ["The client is in the optimal range (2-5 mIU/L).", "The client demonstrates early-stage insulin resistance (Optimal is <7 mIU/L).", "The client is at risk for Type 1 Diabetes.", "The result is clinically insignificant."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine and PCOS mastery, fasting insulin is ideally below 7 mIU/L. A value of 14 mIU/L indicates significant underlying insulin resistance despite being within 'standard' lab ranges."

        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When utilizing Neuro-Endocrine Behavioral Coaching, a client who constantly seeks high-sugar 'rewards' and struggles with binge eating may be demonstrating a deficiency in which neurotransmitter pathway?",
            "options": ["GABA", "Serotonin", "Dopamine", "Acetylcholine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter involved in the reward and motivation pathway. Low dopaminergic tone often leads to 'reward-seeking' behaviors, such as sugar cravings and binge eating, to achieve a temporary spike."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "Under the concept of Metabolic Periodization, why might a practitioner increase caloric intake by 100-200 calories during the mid-to-late luteal phase?",
            "options": ["To induce rapid fat loss", "To account for the 5-10% increase in Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and prevent HPA-axis stress", "To suppress progesterone production", "To improve insulin sensitivity in the follicular phase"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) increases by roughly 5-10% during the luteal phase due to thermogenesis. Failing to account for this can increase cortisol and exacerbate PCOS symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "Which lab marker, when elevated above 25 U/L functionally, serves as a primary indicator of oxidative stress and potential Phase II detoxification impairment?",
            "options": ["ALT", "Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)", "Albumin", "Bilirubin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GGT is a sensitive marker for glutathione depletion and oxidative stress. While standard labs allow higher levels, functional practitioners look for GGT to be between 10-20 U/L."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "A client with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is struggling with estrogen dominance. Which 'Epigenetic Mastery' intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": ["High-dose synthetic Folic Acid", "Supporting methylation with Methylfolate (5-MTHF) and Methylcobalamin", "Increasing soy isoflavone intake", "Aggressive fasted cardio"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MTHFR mutations impair the conversion of folate to its active form, which is crucial for methylation. Supporting this pathway with methylated B-vitamins helps metabolize estrogen effectively."

        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "When managing a 'recalcitrant' case where a client has plateaued for 12 weeks despite perfect adherence, what is the first priority for a Master Practitioner?",
            "options": ["Reduce calories further by 500/day", "Add 4 hours of HIIT per week", "Assess for 'Hidden Stressors' such as mold, occult infections, or HPA-dysfunction", "Recommend a 3-day water fast"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recalcitrant cases usually involve physiological 'brakes' like chronic inflammation, mold toxicity, or HPA-axis burnout that prevent metabolic flexibility regardless of caloric intake."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "Using the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) communication model, how should a PCOS Specialist approach a client's physician regarding a suspected thyroid issue?",
            "options": ["Tell the doctor exactly which medication to prescribe", "Provide the client's lab data and suggest a full thyroid panel (including T3/T4/Antibodies) for further investigation", "Diagnose the client with Hashimoto's in the referral note", "Advise the doctor that their previous assessment was incorrect"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Master Practitioner acts as a bridge. Using SBAR to present objective data and suggest (rather than demand) further testing maintains professional boundaries and collaborative care."

        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "In the Master Practitioner Business Model, what is the primary ethical reason for maintaining a strict 'Scope of Practice'?",
            "options": ["To avoid paying higher insurance premiums", "To ensure client safety and avoid practicing medicine without a license", "To make the coaching process faster", "To limit the number of clients one can see"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires staying within the scope of education and wellness. Diagnosing or treating disease is the domain of licensed medical professionals; specialists provide education, lifestyle architecture, and support."

        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the 'Amygdala Hijack' in the context of PCOS behavioral coaching?",
            "options": ["A physical growth on the brain", "An immediate emotional response that bypasses the prefrontal cortex, often leading to 'stress eating'", "A type of insulin resistance in the brain", "A hormonal surge during ovulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala Hijack occurs when a perceived stressor triggers an emotional response that shuts down logical thinking (prefrontal cortex), often resulting in impulsive behaviors like binge eating."
