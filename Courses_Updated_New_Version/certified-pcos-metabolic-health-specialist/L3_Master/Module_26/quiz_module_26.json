            "question": "In the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Architecture framework for program design, what does the 'E' represent, and what is its primary focus?",
            "options": [
                "Energy Balance; focusing strictly on caloric deficits for weight loss.",
                "Endocrine Alignment; focusing on balancing the HPO and HPA axes to reduce androgen dominance.",
                "Exercise Efficiency; focusing on HIIT protocols to maximize fat oxidation.",
                "Environmental Elimination; focusing on removing all plastics from the household."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the S.T.E.A.D.Y. framework, 'E' stands for Endocrine Alignment, which prioritizes the hormonal crosstalk between the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries (HPO), and adrenals (HPA) to address the root causes of PCOS."

            "id": "q26_2",

            "options": [
                "Aggressive fat loss through caloric restriction and heavy lifting.",
                "Introducing advanced intermittent fasting protocols (18:6).",
                "Blood sugar stabilization and reducing systemic inflammation to 'quiet' the metabolic alarm.",
                "Testing metabolic flexibility by introducing high-carb refeed days."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first four weeks are dedicated to stabilization. By focusing on blood sugar and inflammation, the coach 'quiets' the body's stress response, making it more receptive to fat loss in later phases."

        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "For a client identified with the 'Adrenal PCOS' phenotype, which nutritional strategy is most critical for program development?",
            "options": [
                "Strict ketogenic dieting to eliminate all insulin spikes.",
                "High-protein, moderate-carb intake with a focus on complex carbohydrates at dinner to support evening cortisol clearance.",
                "Prolonged fasted cardio to maximize adrenal output.",
                "Zero-carb breakfast to keep insulin low throughout the day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adrenal phenotypes often struggle with dysregulated cortisol. Including complex carbohydrates in the evening can help lower cortisol levels, improve sleep, and support the nervous system, unlike strict keto which may increase adrenal stress."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "According to the Movement Systems lesson, why is resistance training prioritized over chronic steady-state cardio for insulin-resistant PCOS clients?",
            "options": [
                "Cardio causes permanent damage to the thyroid in PCOS patients.",
                "Muscle tissue is the primary site for GLUT4 translocation, allowing for non-insulin-mediated glucose uptake.",
                "Resistance training is the only way to burn calories in a PCOS metabolism.",
                "Cardio increases testosterone levels, whereas lifting lowers them."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance training increases muscle mass and the density of GLUT4 transporters, which allows the body to clear glucose from the blood more efficiently, even without high levels of insulin."

            "id": "q26_5",

                "Eliminating all cruciferous vegetables."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA (found in receipts) and Phthalates (found in plastics) are potent xenoestrogens that mimic estrogen and disrupt endocrine function. Glass storage is a foundational environmental intervention."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "In Behavioral Architecture (L6), the 'Identity-Based Habit' approach suggests that for a PCOS client to sustain a program, they must:",
            "options": [
                "Focus entirely on the outcome (e.g., 'I want to lose 20 lbs').",
                "Shift their focus from what they want to achieve to who they wish to become (e.g., 'I am the type of person who prioritizes her metabolic health').",
                "Use willpower and discipline as the primary drivers of change.",
                "Only change their habits once they see significant weight loss on the scale."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits are more sustainable because the behavior becomes an extension of the self rather than a chore performed to reach a distant goal."

            "question": "A coach wants to transition from 1-on-1 coaching to a 'Scalable Hybrid Model.' What defines this model?",
            "options": [
                "A model where the coach does not interact with clients at all.",

                "Selling only one-time meal plans with no follow-up.",
                "Working 40 hours a week of 1-on-1 sessions at a lower price point."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid Model leverages digital assets for education while maintaining the high-value coaching element, allowing the coach to serve more people without increasing their workload linearly."

            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Lagging Indicator' in outcome analytics (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "Daily protein intake tracking.",

                "Number of minutes spent in meditation daily."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lagging indicators like HbA1c or body weight are results that take time to change. Leading indicators (steps, protein, sleep) are the behaviors that eventually produce the lagging results."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A client in Week 10 (Optimization Phase) of your 16-week program reports that her energy is high, but her weight loss has slowed to 0.2 lbs per week. What is the best coaching iteration?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately cut calories by another 500 per day.",
                "Assess non-scale victories (NSVs) like waist circumference and cycle regularity, and consider a 'Metabolic Break' or maintenance week.",
                "Tell the client she is failing the program and needs more cardio.",
                "Switch her to a different PCOS phenotype protocol immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the Optimization phase, weight loss may slow as the body adapts. Assessing NSVs ensures the coach doesn't over-stress the metabolism with further restriction when health markers are improving."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "In the context of Outcome Analytics, a HOMA-IR score of 4.5 indicates:",

                "That the client is in the 'Yield' phase of the program."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, and a score above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance. 4.5 is a high-risk marker requiring intervention."
