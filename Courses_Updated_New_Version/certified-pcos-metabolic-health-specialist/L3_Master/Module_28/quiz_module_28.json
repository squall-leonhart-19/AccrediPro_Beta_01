            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR of 7.2 and fasting insulin of 35 µIU/mL. According to Lesson 1, which 'Metabolic Crisis' strategy should be prioritized first?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive caloric restriction to force weight loss",
                "Glycemic stabilization and 'lowering the ceiling' of insulin spikes",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve insulin sensitivity",
                "Intermittent fasting with a 20:4 window"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In an acute metabolic crisis (HOMA-IR > 5), the priority is stabilizing blood sugar and preventing the massive insulin spikes that drive systemic inflammation, rather than aggressive weight loss or high-intensity exercise which can further stress the system."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Cortisol Flatlining' (Stage 3 HPA dysfunction) is distinguished from 'Wired but Tired' (Stage 2) by which primary biomarker finding?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated evening cortisol with low morning cortisol",
                "High DHEA-S with high morning cortisol",
                "A flattened diurnal curve with low cortisol output across all four collection points",
                "Normal cortisol levels but high ACTH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stage 3 HPA axis collapse (flatlining) is characterized by a loss of the diurnal rhythm and chronically low cortisol output throughout the entire day, indicating a state of profound exhaustion."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the 'Overshoot Phenomenon' observed in clients who discontinue GLP-1 agonists without a transition protocol?",
            "options": [
                "A rapid increase in testosterone levels",
                "Regaining more fat mass than was lost due to a lower BMR and loss of lean muscle",
                "A permanent increase in appetite-suppressing hormones",
                "Spontaneous resolution of PCOS symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Overshoot Phenomenon' occurs when the rapid loss of lean muscle mass during GLP-1 use results in a significantly lower Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Upon cessation, the rebound hunger leads to rapid fat gain, often exceeding original weight."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "In the 'D' Protocol for environmental toxicity (Lesson 4), why must 'Drainage' be established before 'Detox'?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the potency of detox supplements",
                "To prevent the 're-circulation' of toxins and Herxheimer reactions by ensuring exit pathways are open",
                "Drainage is only necessary for clients with the HLA-DR gene",
                "To ensure the client loses weight before detoxing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Drainage (supporting liver, bile, kidneys, and bowels) ensures that once toxins are mobilized during the 'Detox' phase, they have a clear path out of the body, preventing systemic re-absorption."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 notes that in PCOS-related Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL), which factor is often the 'silent' contributor to failed implantation?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive Vitamin D levels",
                "Chronic low-grade endometritis and hypercoagulability (thrombophilia)",
                "Low testosterone levels",
                "Excessive cervical mucus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PCOS clients have a higher prevalence of thrombophilia and chronic uterine inflammation, both of which can lead to micro-clots at the implantation site and subsequent pregnancy loss."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 regarding Sarcopenic Obesity, what is the 'Anabolic Resistance' threshold for protein intake per meal to trigger muscle protein synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams",
                "20 grams",
                "30-40 grams with at least 2.5g of Leucine",
                "60 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients with sarcopenic obesity often suffer from anabolic resistance, requiring a higher 'bolus' of protein (30-40g) and specific leucine levels to overcome the threshold for muscle building."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, PMDD in PCOS clients is primarily driven by which neurometabolic mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "A total lack of progesterone in the luteal phase",
                "An abnormal sensitivity of GABA-A receptors to the metabolite allopregnanolone",
                "Excessive serotonin production",
                "Low blood sugar during the follicular phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PMDD is not typically caused by a hormone deficiency, but rather by how the brain's GABA-A receptors respond to the fluctuations of allopregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "What does the 'S' stand for in the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Protocol (Lesson 8), and what is its primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "Supplements; to fix deficiencies immediately",
                "Screening; to perform $2,000 worth of lab tests on day one",
                "Stabilization; to reduce systemic 'noise' and acute stressors before deep intervention",
                "Surgery; to address physical cysts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stabilization is the first step, focusing on 'calming the storm' by addressing sleep, hydration, and acute blood sugar swings before attempting complex protocols or heavy testing."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client stopping the birth control pill experiences a massive acne flare 4 months later. Based on Lesson 3, this is likely due to:",
            "options": [
                "A permanent allergy to the pill",
                "The 'Androgen Rebound' where sebum production spikes as the skin's receptors re-sensitize",
                "A lack of Vitamin E",
                "Excessive estrogen production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-pill androgen rebound occurs because the pill suppresses sebum production; once removed, the body over-compensates, typically peaking between 3-6 months post-cessation."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, which percentage of the population is estimated to have the HLA-DR genetic susceptibility that makes them 'poor mold clearers'?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10%",
                "25%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 25% of the population carries the HLA-DR genetic variants that prevent the immune system from properly identifying and clearing biotoxins like mold, leading to CIRS."
