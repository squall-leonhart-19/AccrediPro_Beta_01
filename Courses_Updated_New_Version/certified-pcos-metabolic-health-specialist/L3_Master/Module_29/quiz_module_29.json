            "question": "In the S.T.E.A.D.Y. Method™ clinical synthesis, what does the 'D' represent, and why is it prioritized in the Master Practitioner's hierarchy?",
            "options": [
                "Daily Movement; because caloric expenditure is the primary driver of insulin sensitivity.",
                "Digestive Health & Nutrient Density; because gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can drive systemic insulin resistance regardless of macronutrient intake.",
                "Dopamine Regulation; because PCOS is primarily a neurochemical disorder of reward seeking.",
                "Detoxification Support; because the liver is the only organ capable of reversing PCOS symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'D' stands for Digestive Health & Nutrient Density. Master Practitioners recognize that intestinal permeability and endotoxemia (LPS) are potent drivers of metabolic inflammation (metabolic endotoxemia) that can stall progress even with perfect macros."

            "question": "A client presents with a fasting insulin of 14 µIU/mL and a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dL. Using the HOMA-IR calculation taught in Lesson 2, what is the result and clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR 2.1; Optimal metabolic health.",
                "HOMA-IR 4.2; Severe insulin resistance requiring immediate medical intervention.",
                "HOMA-IR 3.4; Significant insulin resistance indicating the body is working 3x harder than optimal to maintain glucose.",
                "HOMA-IR 1.5; Mild insulin sensitivity with no cause for concern."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR is calculated as (Insulin x Glucose) / 405. (14 x 98) / 405 = 3.39. A score above 1.9 indicates early IR, and above 2.9 indicates significant IR. This client's tissues are resistant, requiring elevated insulin to maintain 'normal' glucose."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Dynamic Glucose Management' lesson, why is resistance training considered a 'metabolic bypass' for PCOS clients?",
            "options": [
                "It burns more calories per minute than any other form of exercise.",
                "It stimulates GLUT4 translocation through the AMPK pathway, allowing glucose uptake into muscle cells without requiring insulin.",
                "It specifically targets and shrinks the ovaries' androgen-producing theca cells.",
                "It increases cortisol, which helps mobilize stored glucose for better burning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Muscle contraction during resistance training activates AMPK, which triggers GLUT4 receptors to move to the cell surface and pull in glucose independently of insulin signaling. This 'bypasses' the insulin resistance at the receptor level."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "In the 'Neuroendocrine Web' (L4), how does chronic HPA axis activation (stress) directly contribute to the 'Anovulatory Cycle' in PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol increases LH pulse frequency, causing the follicle to rupture too early.",
                "CRH (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone) inhibits GnRH pulses, while cortisol reduces the sensitivity of the pituitary to GnRH.",
                "Stress reduces insulin, which prevents the ovaries from receiving enough energy to ovulate.",
                "Cortisol converts all available progesterone into testosterone via the 'Progesterone Steal' mechanism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High stress/CRH disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis by suppressing the pulsatile release of GnRH and blunting the pituitary response, which prevents the LH surge necessary for ovulation."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "A client has high Beta-glucuronidase levels on a stool test and elevated circulating estrogens. Which 'Systemic Detoxification' intervention is most clinically indicated?",
            "options": [
                "A 3-day juice cleanse to rest the digestive system.",
                "High-dose Vitamin C to acidify the urine.",
                "Calcium D-Glutarate supplementation to inhibit the enzyme and allow estrogen excretion.",
                "Increasing HIIT sessions to sweat out the excess hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme that 'un-conjugates' estrogen in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed. Calcium D-Glutarate inhibits this enzyme, ensuring Phase II detox products are actually excreted in the stool."

            "question": "The 'Non-Responder' Protocol (L6) suggests that if a client's weight and labs are stalled despite a 20% caloric deficit, the practitioner should FIRST investigate:",
            "options": [
                "Hidden food sensitivities like lectins and nightshades.",
                "Circadian disruption and sleep architecture (specifically the 10 PM - 2 AM window).",
                "Increasing the caloric deficit to 30% to break the plateau.",
                "Adding more cardio to increase the 'calories out' side of the equation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep and circadian rhythms govern insulin sensitivity and leptin signaling. If sleep is fragmented or poorly timed, the body remains in a pro-inflammatory, fat-storing state regardless of caloric intake."

            "question": "What is the 'PCOS Paradox' regarding longevity and life-stage transitions discussed in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "Women with PCOS have higher cardiovascular risk but lower rates of osteoporosis.",
                "Women with PCOS often experience an 'ovulatory peak' in their late 30s and a later menopause due to a larger primordial follicle pool.",
                "PCOS symptoms disappear entirely at age 40 due to natural androgen decline.",
                "Insulin resistance in PCOS actually protects against Alzheimer's disease."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'PCOS Paradox' refers to the observation that women with PCOS often have higher Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels and more follicles, which can lead to improved fertility in their late 30s and a menopause that occurs 2-4 years later than average."

            "options": [
                "To show the client how many supplements they need to buy.",
                "To visually demonstrate the interconnectedness of the client's symptoms (e.g., how gut health affects skin and mood) to increase buy-in.",
                "To provide a legal document that protects the practitioner from liability.",
                "To track the client's weight loss progress on a weekly basis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Synthesis Map helps the client understand 'The Why' behind their protocol. By showing how their HPA axis, gut, and metabolic health are linked, practitioners increase compliance and establish themselves as master-level experts."

            "question": "A 'Non-Responder' client presents with 'Thin PCOS' (BMI 21), high DHEA-S, but normal fasting insulin and glucose. What is the most likely master-level integration for this case?",
            "options": [
                "Implement a strict ketogenic diet to lower insulin further.",
                "Focus on 'Adrenal PCOS' drivers: nervous system regulation, magnesium, and B-vitamins, rather than aggressive glucose management.",
                "Prescribe intense CrossFit 5 days a week to build muscle mass.",
                "Assume the client is under-reporting calories and reduce their intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In 'Thin PCOS' with high DHEA-S and normal insulin, the driver is often adrenal-based rather than metabolic. Aggressive dieting or over-exercising will worsen the HPA axis dysfunction and increase adrenal androgens."

            "question": "When interpreting a CGM trace (Lesson 3), a 'Glycemic Variability' (Standard Deviation) of >20 mg/dL is significant because:",
            "options": [
                "It indicates the client is eating too much protein.",
                "Rapid swings in glucose (spikes and crashes) generate more oxidative stress and inflammation than a steady, slightly elevated glucose level.",
                "It proves the client is cheating on their diet.",
                "It means the CGM sensor is faulty and needs to be replaced."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High glycemic variability (the 'rollercoaster' effect) is more damaging to the vascular endothelium and mitochondria than 'stable' high glucose. It triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome and drives the androgenic response in the ovaries."
