            "options": [
                "To prescribe a specific clinical treatment plan for postpartum depression",
                "To establish a baseline of the client's physical, emotional, and social landscape",
                "To provide immediate nutritional supplements to correct deficiencies",
                "To begin the process of sleep training for the newborn"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recovery Evaluation is about assessment and establishing a baseline of the 'postpartum landscape' across multiple domains (physical, emotional, social) before interventions begin."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While specific thresholds vary by provider, a score of 10-13+ is generally the clinical cutoff for referral. Any positive response to Question 10 (suicidal ideation) requires immediate referral regardless of the total score."

                "It allows the coach to correct the client's memory of the medical events",
                "It helps the client move from a fragmented, emotional memory to a cohesive, integrated narrative",
                "It is a technique used to distract the client from birth trauma",
