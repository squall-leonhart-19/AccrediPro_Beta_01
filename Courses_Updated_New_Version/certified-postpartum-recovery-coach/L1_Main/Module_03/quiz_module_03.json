            "question": "A postpartum client describes feeling 'numb,' 'disconnected from her legs,' and 'moving through fog.' According to Polyvagal Theory, which state is she likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic Adrenal (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Collapse)",
                "Hyper-Vigilant Activation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is characterized by immobilization, dissociation, numbness, and a 'shut down' response to overwhelming stress or trauma."

            "question": "In somatic recovery, what is the primary difference between 'Top-Down' and 'Bottom-Up' processing?",
            "options": [
                "Top-Down focuses on the pelvic floor; Bottom-Up focuses on the brain.",
                "Top-Down uses cognitive reasoning; Bottom-Up uses sensory and body-based input.",
                "Top-Down is for physical fitness; Bottom-Up is for mental health.",
                "Top-Down is only used in clinical settings; Bottom-Up is for coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Top-Down processing involves the prefrontal cortex and cognitive strategies, while Bottom-Up processing—the core of somatic work—starts with physiological sensations to influence the brain."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for interoception, or the ability to sense the internal state of the body?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Insular Cortex (Insula)",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex acts as the 'map' of the body's internal state, processing signals from the heart, lungs, and gut to create a sense of 'how we feel.'"

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "During a proper diaphragmatic 'Core Breath,' what should occur in the pelvic floor during the inhalation phase?",
            "options": [
                "The pelvic floor should contract and lift.",
                "The pelvic floor should remain completely rigid.",
                "The pelvic floor should eccentrically lengthen and relax.",
                "The pelvic floor should be pulled inward toward the navel."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On inhalation, the diaphragm descends, increasing intra-abdominal pressure, which causes the pelvic floor to naturally lengthen and descend (eccentric loading)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is frequently used in somatic coaching as a biomarker for which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Muscular strength and hypertrophy",
                "Vagal tone and nervous system resilience",
                "The presence of Diastasis Recti",
                "Postpartum nutritional deficiencies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates a flexible and resilient nervous system with high vagal tone, meaning the body can switch efficiently between stress and rest states."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "When working with birth trauma, the somatic technique of 'Titration' refers to:",
            "options": [
                "Re-living the entire birth story in vivid detail to 'purge' the memory.",
                "Breaking down traumatic charge into small, manageable 'bytes' to avoid re-traumatization.",
                "Alternating between a place of safety in the body and a place of tension.",
                "Using heavy weights to discharge sympathetic energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the release of traumatic energy so the nervous system can integrate it without becoming overwhelmed or flooded."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Upper Crossed Syndrome' (protracted shoulders and forward head carriage) due to nursing. Which muscle group typically needs 'lengthening' or release in this somatic pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Rhomboids and Middle Trapezius",
                "Deep Neck Flexors",
                "Pectoralis Major and Minor",
                "Serratus Anterior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Upper Crossed Syndrome, the chest muscles (Pectorals) become chronically tight and short, while the back muscles (Rhomboids) become overstretched and weak."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Why does vocalization (such as humming or 'vooing') assist in Vagus Nerve regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It increases CO2 levels in the blood.",
                "It stimulates the laryngeal and pharyngeal branches of the Vagus Nerve.",
                "It forces the client to use their abdominal muscles.",
                "It distracts the brain from intrusive thoughts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve passes through the throat; the vibrations from humming or low-frequency vocalization stimulate the nerve directly, promoting a Ventral Vagal shift."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client is experiencing a 'Sympathetic' spike (anxiety, racing heart) during a session. Which breathwork cue is most appropriate to down-regulate her nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "'Take a sharp, quick inhale through the nose.'",
                "'Hold your breath at the top for five seconds.'",
                "'Lengthen your exhale so it is twice as long as your inhale.'",
                "'Perform 10 rapid 'Breath of Fire' repetitions.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system by signaling the Vagus nerve to slow the heart rate (the 'Vagal Brake')."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "The somatic concept of 'Pendulation' involves helping a client move their attention between:",
            "options": [
                "The past and the future.",
                "A 'resource' (area of ease) and a 'constriction' (area of tension).",
                "The left side and the right side of the brain.",
                "The coach's voice and their own internal monologue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is a Somatic Experiencing technique where the client 'swings' their focus between a place of comfort/safety and a place of discomfort to build capacity for processing stress."
