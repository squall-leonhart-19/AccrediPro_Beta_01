            "question": "Research on 'The Brain Drain' suggests that during pregnancy and lactation, the mother's brain can physically shrink by up to 5% to accommodate the nutritional needs of the fetus. Which nutrient is primarily responsible for this structural mobilization?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHA is a primary structural component of the brain. During the third trimester and lactation, the body prioritizes the transfer of DHA to the infant, often at the expense of maternal brain volume if intake is insufficient."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A client is 3 months postpartum and struggling with slow healing of her C-section incision and pelvic floor laxity. Which amino acid, found in high concentrations in collagen and bone broth, should be prioritized?",
            "options": [
                "Tryptophan",
                "L-Theanine",
                "Glycine",
                "Leucine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycine makes up roughly one-third of collagen. It is essential for the structural repair of connective tissues, skin, and the uterine lining during the postpartum period."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client's blood work shows a Hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL (normal), but her Ferritin is 18 ng/mL. Based on Lesson 3, how should a Recovery Coach view this result?",
            "options": [
                "The client is perfectly healthy as her hemoglobin is within the normal range.",
                "The client has Stage 2 Iron Deficiency (Iron Depletion) which can cause significant fatigue and brain fog despite not being 'anemic'.",
                "The client is suffering from acute iron toxicity.",
                "Ferritin is not a relevant marker for postpartum recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron depletion (low ferritin) often precedes iron-deficiency anemia (low hemoglobin). Many women suffer from 'non-anemic iron deficiency,' which still presents with severe fatigue, hair loss, and mood disturbances."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which poor blood sugar management contributes to 'Postpartum Rage' and anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "Low blood sugar triggers a compensatory spike in cortisol and adrenaline to mobilize glucose, activating the 'fight or flight' response.",
                "High blood sugar destroys the gut lining immediately.",
                "Glucose spikes prevent the absorption of Vitamin C.",
                "Blood sugar has no impact on emotional regulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops too low (hypoglycemia) due to skipped meals or high-sugar snacks, the body releases cortisol and adrenaline to bring it back up. This hormonal surge often manifests as irritability, anxiety, or 'rage'."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Postpartum Gut-Brain Axis' lesson, approximately what percentage of the body's serotonin is produced in the gastrointestinal tract?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "50-60%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vast majority of serotonin, a key neurotransmitter for mood stability, is produced in the gut. Postpartum gut dysbiosis can therefore directly impair maternal mental health."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "A breastfeeding client complains of low milk supply and is drinking 4 liters of plain water a day. Why might this approach be ineffective or even counterproductive?",
            "options": [
                "Water is toxic to breast milk production.",
                "Excessive plain water can dilute essential electrolytes like sodium and potassium, which are required for the cellular transport of milk.",
                "Lactation requires dehydration to concentrate nutrients.",
                "She should be drinking fruit juice instead of water."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hydration is about fluid balance, not just volume. Over-consuming plain water without electrolytes can lead to dilution, potentially signaling the kidneys to increase output and failing to support the mineral-heavy process of lactation."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurvedic postpartum traditions, why are 'warming' foods prioritized over 'cold' foods like raw salads in the first 40 days?",
            "options": [
                "Cold foods contain more bacteria.",
                "Warming foods are easier to digest, preserving 'Agni' (digestive fire) and redirecting energy toward tissue healing and uterine involution.",
                "Warming foods have fewer calories.",
                "Raw vegetables are strictly toxic during the postpartum period."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traditional wisdom suggests that the postpartum body is 'cold' and depleted. Easy-to-digest, warm foods prevent the digestive system from working too hard, allowing the body's energy to focus on healing the reproductive organs."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Which B-vitamin is a critical cofactor for the conversion of tryptophan into serotonin and is frequently depleted by the use of oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)",
                "Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)",
                "Vitamin B7 (Biotin)",
                "Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B6 is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis. Depletion from previous birth control use, combined with the demands of pregnancy, often leaves postpartum women deficient, contributing to mood disorders."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "When coaching a client on 'Crowding Out' (The Add, Don't Subtract method), what is the primary goal?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to count every calorie.",
                "To focus on adding nutrient-dense 'healing foods' first, which naturally reduces the appetite for inflammatory, low-nutrient foods without a deprivation mindset.",
                "To eliminate all carbohydrates immediately.",
                "To ensure the client eats at least 6 times per day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crowding out is a psychological and physiological strategy. By focusing on what to *add* (like protein or fiber), the client feels satisfied and nourished, making it easier to naturally reduce less-helpful foods without triggering the stress of restriction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is the most effective 'PFF' snack combination for a coach to recommend for blood sugar stability?",
            "options": [
                "An apple and a glass of juice",
                "A bowl of oatmeal with honey",
                "A hard-boiled egg, half an avocado, and a few berries",
                "A handful of rice crackers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PFF stands for Protein, Fat, and Fiber. The egg (protein/fat), avocado (fat/fiber), and berries (fiber) provide all three components, ensuring a slow glucose release and sustained energy."
