            "question": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™, what is the primary objective of the initial 'R' (Recovery Evaluation) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a clinical diagnosis of postpartum depression",
                "To establish a physiological and psychological baseline for personalized programming",
                "To prescribe a specific caloric restriction for weight loss",
                "To replace the need for an OB-GYN six-week checkup"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Recovery Evaluation phase is designed to gather data and establish a baseline of the client's current state across physical, mental, and hormonal domains to guide the coaching process."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client is 12 days postpartum and reports that her vaginal discharge (lochia) has returned to a bright red color after being pinkish-brown for several days. What is the appropriate coaching response?",
            "options": [
                "Reassure her that Lochia Rubra is normal for the first 4 weeks",
                "Advise her to increase her exercise intensity to help the uterus contract",
                "Identify this as a potential red flag for secondary hemorrhage or overexertion and recommend medical consultation",
                "Suggest she increase her iron intake to compensate for the blood loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lochia Rubra typically lasts 3-4 days. A return to bright red bleeding after it has lightened (Lochia Serosa) is a clinical red flag indicating potential complications or significant overexertion."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4, which hormonal shift is responsible for the 'hormonal crash' experienced within the first 48-72 hours postpartum?",
            "options": [
                "A 100-fold increase in Oxytocin",
                "A rapid drop in Estrogen and Progesterone following placental delivery",
                "A sudden decrease in Prolactin levels",
                "An immediate surge in Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The delivery of the placenta causes Estrogen and Progesterone levels to drop by approximately 95% within 48 hours, which is the steepest hormonal decline in the human experience."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "When using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for screening, what is the standard 'cutoff' score that indicates a high risk for PMADs and requires a clinical referral?",
            "options": [
                "A score of 5 or higher",
                "A score of 10 or higher",
                "A score of 13 or higher",
                "A score of 25 or higher"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While any score on Question 10 (suicidal ideation) requires immediate action, a total score of 13 or higher is the validated threshold for identifying significant risk of postpartum depression."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which biomarker is most critical to evaluate when a client reports 'brain fog,' extreme fatigue, and postpartum hair loss?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose",
                "Serum Ferritin (Iron stores)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron deficiency (with or without anemia) is a primary driver of postpartum fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and telogen effluvium (hair loss). Ferritin measures the body's stored iron."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Research on postpartum sleep architecture (Lesson 5) indicates that which factor is more detrimental to maternal mental health than total hours of sleep?",
            "options": [
                "The time the client goes to bed",
                "Sleep fragmentation (frequent nighttime awakenings)",

                "Lack of naps during the daylight hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep fragmentation—waking multiple times per night—disrupts sleep cycles and is more strongly correlated with the development of PMADs than total sleep duration."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "During a core integrity screening, you observe a visible 'doming' or 'coning' along the midline of the client's abdomen during a crunch-like movement. What does this likely indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Strong abdominal muscles",
                "A normal variation of postpartum anatomy",
                "Inability to manage intra-abdominal pressure, often associated with Diastasis Recti",
                "The need for more intensive 'sit-up' exercises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doming or coning indicates that the linea alba is unable to maintain tension against intra-abdominal pressure, a hallmark sign of Diastasis Recti Abdominis (DRA)."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A client presents with unilateral (one-sided) leg pain, swelling, and warmth in the calf. What is the correct protocol according to the Recovery Roadmap?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest a gentle calf stretch and hydration",
                "Perform a deep tissue massage on the affected leg",
                "Instruct the client to seek immediate emergency medical evaluation for potential DVT",
                "Wait 24 hours to see if the swelling subsides before taking action"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unilateral leg swelling and pain are classic signs of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), a life-threatening medical emergency common in the postpartum period."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "What is the primary role of Oxytocin in the 'Hormonal Architecture' of the postpartum period?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate the 'fight or flight' response",
                "To promote uterine involution and facilitate the 'let-down' reflex and bonding",
                "To increase blood sugar levels for energy",
                "To prevent the onset of the 'Baby Blues'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, often called the 'love hormone,' is essential for uterine contractions (involution), milk ejection, and maternal-infant bonding."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing data for the Recovery Roadmap, why is it important to distinguish between 'Baby Blues' and Postpartum Depression (PPD)?",
            "options": [
                "Because Baby Blues require medication, while PPD does not",
                "Because Baby Blues typically resolve within 10-14 days, while PPD is persistent and requires clinical intervention",
                "Because only PPD affects the mother's ability to bond with the baby",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Baby Blues are a transient period of emotional lability affecting up to 80% of women, resolving by day 14. PPD is a clinical condition that persists longer and requires professional mental health support."
