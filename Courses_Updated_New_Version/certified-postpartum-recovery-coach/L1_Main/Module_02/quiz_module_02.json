            "question": "A client is 3 weeks postpartum and reports persistent low mood, inability to sleep even when the baby sleeps, and feelings of worthlessness. How does this differ from 'Baby Blues'?",
            "options": [
                "Baby Blues typically peak at day 14 and resolve by week 6.",
                "Baby Blues usually resolve within 10–14 days; persistence beyond this suggests a PMAD.",
                "There is no difference; these are standard symptoms for the first 3 months.",
                "Baby Blues involve suicidal ideation, whereas PPD does not."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Baby Blues are considered a transient period of emotional reactivity that typically resolves within 10 to 14 days. Symptoms persisting or worsening after the second week are clinical indicators for postpartum depression (PPD) or other PMADs."

            "options": [
                "To erase the memory of the traumatic event entirely.",
                "To move the birth memory from the amygdala to the prefrontal cortex for processing.",
                "To ensure the client remembers every detail in chronological order.",
                "To suppress the emotional response so the client can focus on the baby."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traumatic memories are often stored as fragmented, sensory experiences in the amygdala. Narrative coaching helps integrate these into the prefrontal cortex, turning 'hot' emotional memories into a cohesive 'cool' narrative."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Motherhood Constellation, as described by Daniel Stern, is the unique psychological state where a woman's primary mental organization shifts toward the life-growth and survival of her infant."

                "Clinical Narcissism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a person's loss isn't openly acknowledged, socially validated, or publicly mourned. In postpartum, this often happens when a mother's grief over her birth experience is dismissed because the 'outcome' (a healthy baby) was achieved."

                "The thoughts are pleasant daydreams about the future."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ego-dystonic thoughts are those that are inconsistent with a person's values and self-image. In postpartum anxiety/OCD, these thoughts are horrifying to the mother, which is a key clinical indicator that she is not a risk to the baby."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postpartum rage is often the 'tip of the iceberg.' Beneath the surface, it is usually driven by sensory overload, sleep deprivation, unmet needs, or a lack of support."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An EPDS score of 10 or 12+ (depending on the clinical setting) is the standard threshold for a referral. As a coach, you do not diagnose, but you must refer for clinical evaluation when screening indicates high risk."
