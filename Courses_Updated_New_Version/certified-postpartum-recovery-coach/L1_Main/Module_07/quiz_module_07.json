            "question": "Matrescence is frequently compared to which other major developmental milestone due to the intensity of hormonal, physical, and social shifts?",
            "options": [
                "Menopause",
                "Adolescence (Puberty)",
                "Early Childhood Development",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Like adolescence, matrescence is a 'biopsychosocial' transition. Anthropologist Dana Raphael coined the term to describe the profound identity shift that occurs when a woman becomes a mother."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Neurobiological research (Hoekzema et al., 2017) indicates that the maternal brain undergoes 'synaptic pruning' in the gray matter. What is the functional purpose of this shift?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce overall cognitive capacity to save energy",
                "To eliminate unnecessary memories from before the birth",
                "To optimize the brain for social cognition and attachment",
                "To repair damage caused by pregnancy-related sleep deprivation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synaptic pruning in the maternal brain is an optimization process, making the brain more efficient at processing social cues and responding to the infant's needs, rather than a loss of function."

            "question": "How does 'Radical Self-Preservation' differ from standard 'Self-Care' in the context of the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Blueprint™?",
            "options": [
                "Self-care is about pampering; self-preservation is about basic survival like eating and sleeping.",
                "Self-care is often a temporary escape; self-preservation involves setting boundaries and protecting energy as a non-negotiable standard.",
                "Self-preservation is only for mothers with clinical postpartum depression.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radical Self-Preservation focuses on the structural and boundary-related changes necessary to sustain maternal health long-term, moving beyond the 'bubble bath' consumerist version of self-care."

            "explanation": "Identity Reclamation helps mothers integrate their pre-baby self with their new maternal identity by aligning actions with core values rather than societal 'shoulds.'"

                "Until the mother stops breastfeeding.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that the structural brain changes associated with matrescence are still evident at least two years postpartum, highlighting that this is a long-term developmental shift."
