            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those cited by ACOG, show that up to 40% of women do not attend their postpartum visit, leaving them without clinical support during a vulnerable physiological transition."

            "options": [
                "They drop precipitously to near-zero or pre-pregnancy levels",
                "They remain elevated for 6 weeks to support lactation",
                "They gradually decline over a 3-month period",
                "They increase further to stimulate oxytocin production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The delivery of the placenta triggers an immediate and massive drop in progesterone and estrogen, which is a primary driver of the 'Baby Blues' and significant endocrine stress."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While depth and tension of the linea alba are also critical, a width of 2 cm (roughly two finger-widths) is the standard clinical threshold for identifying DRA."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Question 10 specifically screens for suicidal ideation. Any positive response (1, 2, or 3) necessitates an immediate referral to a mental health professional or emergency services per safety protocols."

                "To observe how the core and pelvic floor manage pressure during daily tasks like lifting a car seat",
                "To calculate the client's basal metabolic rate for weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional loading assessments help the coach identify if the client is 'leaking' pressure (via the pelvic floor or abdominal wall) during the specific movements they perform in daily motherhood."

            "question": "How does the hormone Prolactin, which is elevated during breastfeeding, typically impact the client's reproductive hormones?",
            "options": [
                "It increases estrogen to improve vaginal lubrication",
                "It has no effect on other hormones",
                "It suppresses the HPO axis, leading to low estrogen and suppressed ovulation",
                "It stimulates the thyroid to increase metabolic rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High prolactin levels inhibit the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis, which keeps estrogen levels low (similar to menopause) and often prevents the return of the menstrual cycle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Birth trauma can lead to physical 'guarding' (hypertonic pelvic floor) and chronic cortisol elevation, both of which can significantly stall physical and hormonal recovery."
