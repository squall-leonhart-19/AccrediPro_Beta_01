            "question": "According to the hierarchy of evidence-based practice discussed in Lesson 1, which type of study provides the highest level of clinical certainty for postpartum interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)",
                "Case studies and anecdotal reports from experienced coaches",
                "Single-blinded observational cohort studies",
                "Expert opinion and consensus statements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses and systematic reviews sit at the top of the evidence hierarchy because they synthesize data from multiple high-quality RCTs to provide a more reliable conclusion."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "When utilizing the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as part of the 'Recovery Evaluation' (R), what is a critical clinical distinction coaches must maintain?",
            "options": [
                "The EPDS is a diagnostic tool that confirms clinical depression",
                "A score of 5 or higher always indicates a need for immediate hospitalization",
                "The EPDS is a screening tool, not a diagnostic tool, and requires clinical follow-up for high scores",
                "The EPDS should only be administered by a licensed psychiatrist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 emphasizes that while coaches use validated tools to evaluate recovery, the EPDS is a screening instrument meant to identify risk and facilitate referrals, not to provide a medical diagnosis."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Research on neuroplasticity (Lesson 3) indicates that during matrescence, the maternal brain undergoes significant 'synaptic pruning' in which specific area?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show that the maternal brain undergoes gray matter pruning in the social cognition network to increase efficiency in processing infant cues and social-emotional information."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the context of Somatic Science (Lesson 4), what does a high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) typically indicate about a postpartum client's nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "A state of chronic sympathetic dominance (fight or flight)",
                "A rigid and unresponsive autonomic nervous system",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV is a biomarker of autonomic flexibility and the ability of the nervous system to return to a state of safety and social engagement (ventral vagal) after a stressor."

            "id": "q19_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Matrescence is often compared to adolescence (puberty) because both involve massive hormonal shifts, neurobiological restructuring, and a fundamental transition in social identity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHA is critical for brain function; because the fetus sequesters maternal DHA during pregnancy, depletion without adequate replenishment is linked to postpartum depression and cognitive 'fog'."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Buffering Hypothesis' in sociological research (Lesson 7), how does relational support impact the postpartum recovery process?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the presence of stressors entirely",
                "It only works if the support comes from a medical professional",
                "It protects the individual from the pathogenic effects of stressful life events",
                "It has no measurable effect on cortisol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The buffering hypothesis suggests that social support acts as a protective shield, reducing the negative physiological and psychological impact of stress during the postpartum period."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A strong Sense of Coherence (viewing life as manageable, meaningful, and comprehensible) is a key predictor of long-term mental health and adaptive family dynamics."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study by Hoekzema et al. (2017) found that the neural changes were so consistent and specific that they could predict maternal attachment quality and distinguish between mothers and non-mothers."
