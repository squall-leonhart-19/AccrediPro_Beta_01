            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'wired but tired' state indicates that the metabolic system (adrenals) is over-compensating for a dysregulated or exhausted nervous system, requiring integrated nutritional and somatic support."
