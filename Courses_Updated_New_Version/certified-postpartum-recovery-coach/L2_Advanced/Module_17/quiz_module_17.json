                "Encourage the client to 'push through' the sensation to reach catharsis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In somatic integration, when a client enters a freeze state, the coach must first establish safety and presence through grounding before any further processing can occur."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation severely impairs the prefrontal cortex, which is already the area of dysfunction in ADHD, leading to a total collapse of executive function skills like planning and emotional regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "With high-order multiples, maternal mental health and sleep are the priorities; a sustainable plan often involves 'tactical supplementation' to prevent total physical exhaustion."
