            "question": "When performing an Advanced Recovery Evaluation (L1), what is the primary clinical indicator that a client’s Diastasis Recti Abdominis (DRA) requires specialized physical therapy rather than just coaching-led corrective exercise?",
            "options": [
                "A gap width of more than 2.5 centimeters at the umbilicus.",
                "The inability to generate tension in the linea alba (doming/coning) despite proper transverse abdominis activation.",
                "The presence of a palpable gap that does not close during a crunch movement.",
                "A history of more than two vaginal deliveries regardless of current gap size."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While gap width is a common metric, the 'functional' integrity of the linea alba (the ability to generate tension) is the critical indicator for advanced recovery. If the tissue cannot create tension, it indicates a lack of load transfer capability requiring clinical intervention."

            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Emotional Processing (L2), what is the '30-day window' significance regarding birth trauma integration?",
            "options": [
                "Symptoms of intrusive thoughts must resolve within 30 days to avoid a PTSD diagnosis.",
                "Birth trauma cannot be processed until the 30-day hormone crash has stabilized.",
                "Symptoms occurring within the first 30 days are classified as Acute Stress Disorder; persistent symptoms beyond this require specialized trauma screening.",
                "The brain's neuroplasticity is highest in the first 30 days, making it the only time 'de-briefing' is effective."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinically, symptoms of trauma within the first month are often categorized as Acute Stress Disorder. If these symptoms persist beyond 30 days, they meet the duration criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), necessitating a shift in the coaching approach or referral."

            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory in Postpartum (L3), which state must the mother's nervous system primarily occupy to facilitate optimal 'Social Engagement' and oxytocin release during breastfeeding?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Activation (Mobilization)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Immobilization)",
                "Ventral Vagal (Safety and Connection)",
                "Freeze Response (High-arousal conservation)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal complex, part of the Social Engagement System, is responsible for feelings of safety and connection. This state is physiological prerequisite for the optimal release of oxytocin, which governs the let-down reflex and bonding."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "High-achieving clients often experience 'Identity Fusion' (L4). Which coaching strategy is most effective for a client struggling with the 'Good Mother' archetype vs. 'Professional Identity'?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to choose one identity to prioritize for the first year.",
                "Values-based integration: identifying core values that exist in both roles to reduce cognitive dissonance.",
                "Suggesting a complete break from professional thoughts to focus on 'present-moment' mothering.",
                "Focusing on time-management skills to ensure both roles are equally represented in the daily schedule."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For high-achievers, identity conflict is rarely solved by 'choosing' one side. Identifying underlying values (e.g., leadership, nurturing, growth) that apply to both motherhood and career helps integrate the self-concept and reduces the distress of 'identity split'."

            "options": [
                "Postpartum Hemorrhage-induced Anemia",
                "Postpartum Thyroiditis",
                "Gestational Diabetes relapse",
                "Vitamin B12 deficiency only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postpartum Thyroiditis affects approximately 5-10% of women. The symptoms of cold intolerance, fatigue, and hair loss (often following a brief hyperthyroid phase) are hallmark signs that require clinical blood work (TSH/T4 levels)."

                "The process of balancing work, self-care, and parenting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In family systems theory, triangulation occurs when a two-person system (the parents) is under stress and pulls in a third person (an in-law or even the baby) to divert the conflict, which ultimately prevents the parents from resolving their original issue."

                "Positive psychological change experienced as a result of struggling with highly challenging life circumstances.",
                "Forgetting the traumatic details of the birth through positive affirmations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PTG is not about 'bouncing back' to the previous state (resilience), but rather 'bouncing forward'—experiencing a shift in perspective, relationships, or personal strength specifically because of the struggle with trauma."

                "Suggest the client increase their dosage of Omega-3 fatty acids.",
                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional, as a score of 16 indicates moderately severe depression.",
                "Wait two weeks and re-administer the test to check for fluctuations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A PHQ-9 score of 15 or higher indicates moderately severe depression and falls outside the scope of coaching. An immediate referral to a clinical provider (psychiatrist or therapist) is ethically mandatory."

            "question": "Which nutrient, discussed in L5, is critical for the structural integrity of the infant's developing brain and the mother's cognitive 'brain fog' recovery, with a recommended postpartum intake of at least 550mg daily?",
            "options": [
                "Iron",
                "Choline",
                "Calcium",
                "Vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choline is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis and brain health. Many prenatal and postnatal vitamins are deficient in choline, yet it is vital for both the mother's recovery from 'baby brain' and the infant's neurodevelopment via breastmilk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a core somatic concept. It involves breaking down the traumatic charge into small, manageable pieces so the client can integrate the experience without being re-traumatized or pushed into a Dorsal Vagal shutdown."
