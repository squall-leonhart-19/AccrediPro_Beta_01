            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Niching Down' is presented as a strategy for growth. Which of the following is the most effective 'Micro-Niche' for a Postpartum Recovery Coach aiming for high-authority positioning?",
            "options": [
                "Providing general emotional support for all new parents",
                "Offering a 'Recover from Everything' package for any birth outcome",
                "Specializing exclusively in physical and nutritional restoration for C-section athletes",
                "Marketing as a 'Postpartum Doula' who also does light housework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Micro-Niche (like C-section athletes) allows the coach to become a specialist in a specific problem, which commands higher fees and clearer marketing than being a generalist."

            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "Lesson 2 discusses the 'Ethical Marketing Gap.' Why is 'Pain-Point Agitation' marketing considered ethically risky in the postpartum space?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive to implement in small coaching practices",
                "Postpartum clients are in a 'high-vulnerability window' where fear-based marketing can trigger cortisol spikes and anxiety",
                "It violates the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) directly",
                "New mothers are usually too tired to read marketing copy that focuses on pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing for postpartum coaches avoids 'twisting the knife' in pain points, as this demographic is psychologically vulnerable to anxiety and shame-based messaging."

        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "When implementing a content strategy focused on 'Matrescence' (Lesson 3), what is the primary objective of the education?",
            "options": [
                "To convince the client that they have a clinical mental health disorder",
                "To sell as many physical supplements as possible in the first 48 hours",
                "To normalize the identity shift and reduce the 'shame of struggle' through developmental context",
                "To provide a step-by-step guide on sleep training the infant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Educating on Matrescence shifts the narrative from 'I am failing' to 'I am transitioning,' which builds deep trust and positions the coach as an empathetic guide."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4, what is the 'Clinical Referral Protocol' when approaching an OBGYN or Midwife for a partnership?",

                "Offering a 20% commission for every patient the doctor refers to your coaching practice",
                "Demanding that the doctor reviews your entire curriculum before you work with their patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical providers are more likely to refer to coaches who solve a problem for the *provider*—specifically, the time-consuming lifestyle and emotional support that doctors aren't always equipped to provide."

            "id": "q31_5",

                "Viral views on a trending dance reel"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Saves and Shares indicate that the content is being treated as a resource or a 'cry for help/connection,' which signals much higher intent than a passive 'Like.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "During a Discovery Call (Lesson 6), a potential client says, 'I need to talk to my partner about the cost.' What is the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework's recommended response?",

                "Validate the need for partnership support and offer a 'Partner FAQ' sheet to facilitate an informed household decision",
                "End the call immediately as they are not a 'high-ticket' lead"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework emphasizes empowerment; helping the client educate their partner fosters a supportive home environment for the coaching process."

            "id": "q31_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 introduces 'Value-Based Packaging.' Why is the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. program priced as a package rather than an hourly rate?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the coach gets paid even if the client cancels",
                "To shift the focus from 'buying time' to 'investing in a specific recovery outcome'",
                "Because hourly rates are illegal in most postpartum coaching jurisdictions",
                "To make the accounting process easier for tax season"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing commoditizes the coach's time. Package pricing focuses on the transformation (e.g., 'The 12-Week Restoration Journey'), which has higher perceived and actual value."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "Which scaling strategy mentioned in Lesson 8 allows a coach to maintain high intimacy while increasing revenue leverage?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid Group Model allows the coach to serve 10-20 women in the time it usually takes to serve one, without losing the personal connection that postpartum clients crave."

            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "A coach's 'Brand Voice' (Lesson 1) should ideally strike a balance between which two tones to maximize postpartum conversion?",

                "Best Friend and Financial Advisor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Postpartum clients need to feel that the coach is an expert (Authority) but also that the coach 'gets it' (Empathy). Too much of one without the other leads to distrust or lack of respect."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Rule of 7' in the context of Postpartum Content Strategy (Lesson 3)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 7' is a classic marketing principle; in the 'brain fog' of postpartum, repetition is even more critical for a message to be absorbed and acted upon."
