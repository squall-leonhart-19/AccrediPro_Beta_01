            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Restorative function (also known as the 'Supportive' function) focuses on the coach's well-being, helping them process the emotional toll of postpartum work to prevent burnout and compassion fatigue."

            "question": "A coach is supervising a peer regarding Somatic Healing (S). The peer reports that a client becomes 'spaced out' and unresponsive during gentle breathwork. What is the supervisor's most critical recommendation?",

                "Increase the intensity of the breathwork to 'break through' the resistance",
                "Recognize this as dissociation and advise the coach to ground the client and refer to a trauma-specialist therapist",
                "Switch to nutritional interventions (O) to stabilize the client's blood sugar",
                "Encourage the coach to perform a deeper emotional processing (E) session immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation is a sign of nervous system dysregulation that may exceed the coaching scope. The supervisor must ensure the coach recognizes this 'red flag' and prioritizes client safety through grounding and referral."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when a professional redirects their own feelings or past experiences onto a client. Supervision is essential for identifying and managing these reactions to maintain objectivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain evidence-based standards and scope of practice, supervisors must ensure coaches do not cross into 'prescribing.' Coaches provide education, while medical professionals handle specific clinical dosages."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Reflecting Team model involves a group of peers sharing diverse perspectives on a case, which the presenter then 'takes back' to their practice, fostering a non-hierarchical learning environment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supervisors are responsible for brand integrity and ethical compliance. The first step is internal correction through the supervisory relationship to ensure the coach understands and rectifies the scope-of-practice violation."
