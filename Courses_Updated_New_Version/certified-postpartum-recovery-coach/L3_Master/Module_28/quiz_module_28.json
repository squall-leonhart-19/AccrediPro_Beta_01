                "pOCD involves hallucinations, while PPP involves repetitive hand-washing.",
                "pOCD thoughts are ego-dystonic (repugnant to the mother), whereas PPP involves a loss of reality testing (ego-syntonic delusions).",
                "PPP only occurs in mothers with a history of depression, while pOCD is universal.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In pOCD, the mother is horrified by her intrusive thoughts (ego-dystonic) and takes steps to avoid harm. In PPP, the mother may lose touch with reality and believe her delusions are true (ego-syntonic), making it a psychiatric emergency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic grounding, such as the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, helps pull a client out of a trauma response by engaging the senses in the present moment, which is within the coaching scope of practice."
