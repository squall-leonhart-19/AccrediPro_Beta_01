            "question": "During the Deep Recovery Evaluation (DRE), which specific finding necessitates an immediate referral to a clinical psychiatrist rather than continuing with coaching as the primary intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Persistent fatigue and low libido lasting more than six weeks",
                "Occasional intrusive thoughts that the client finds distressing but has no urge to act upon",
                "The presence of ego-syntonic command hallucinations or a break from shared reality",
                "Difficulty bonding with the infant accompanied by feelings of guilt"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners must distinguish between ego-dystonic intrusive thoughts (common in OCD/anxiety) and ego-syntonic hallucinations or psychosis, which are clinical emergencies requiring immediate psychiatric referral."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Linguistic Processing of the birth story, what is the primary purpose of 'Perceptual Positioning'?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client view the birth event from the perspective of the medical staff or the infant to reduce personal shame",
                "To convince the client that their memory of the event is factually incorrect",
                "To encourage the client to forget the negative aspects of the birth through hypnosis",
                "To ensure the coach remains the dominant authority figure in the narrative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Perceptual Positioning allows the client to shift from a 'first-person' trapped perspective to a 'third-person' observer or 'second-person' empathetic perspective, which helps in processing trauma and reducing the intensity of the emotional charge."

            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which 'state' is the Master Practitioner attempting to facilitate to optimize the 'Social Engagement System' and maternal-infant bonding?",

                "Dorsal Vagal (Immobilization/Shutdown)",
                "Sympathetic Adrenal (Fight/Flight)",
                "Ventral Vagal (Safety/Connection)",
                "Functional Freeze (High-functioning Dissociation)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the physiological foundation for safety, connection, and social engagement. Recovery Mastery involves moving the client out of survival states (Dorsal/Sympathetic) into the Ventral state."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 regarding Matrescence, the 'Split-Self' phenomenon is best described as:",

                "The cognitive and emotional tension between the pre-maternal identity and the emerging maternal self",
                "The physical separation of the mother's abdominal muscles (Diastasis Recti)",
                "A lack of communication between the left and right hemispheres of the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Split-Self' is a core concept in Matrescence, representing the internal conflict as a woman navigates the death of her old identity and the birth of her new identity as a mother."

            "id": "q24_5",

                "It determines the baby's bone density during breastfeeding",
                "Magnesium acts as a 'gatekeeper' for the NMDA receptors, preventing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and anxiety",
                "Calcium is the only nutrient required for thyroid function",
                "High magnesium levels are the primary cause of postpartum depression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Master-level nutrition, we look at mineral ratios. Magnesium is essential for modulating the stress response; without it, calcium can cause neuronal over-excitation, leading to the 'wired but tired' state common in HPA-axis dysregulation."

                "To create a healthy support network for the mother"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation is a maladaptive defense mechanism where a third person is pulled into a two-person conflict to reduce immediate tension, though it prevents the original dyad from resolving their issues."

                "Feel a high sense of self-efficacy and agency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An External Locus of Control involves believing that outside forces determine one's outcomes. Master Practitioners work to shift this toward an Internal Locus of Control to cultivate agency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethics at the Master level require precise boundary management, ensuring the coach provides education and support while explicitly staying out of medical diagnosis or prescription."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Tracking is a master-level skill used to teach the brain that the sensations in the body are 'safe,' thereby down-regulating the central nervous system's pain response."

        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "In the 'Path to Empowered Matrescence,' what is the significance of 'Radical Responsibility'?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radical Responsibility is about agency; it is the shift from 'victimhood' to 'empowerment' by recognizing that while we cannot control events, we have the absolute power to choose our response."
