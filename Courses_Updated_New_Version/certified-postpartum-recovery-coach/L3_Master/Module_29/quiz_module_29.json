            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework, 'S' stands for Systemic Stabilization, which focuses on calming the nervous system and balancing endocrine function before moving into deeper psychological or nutritional interventions."

            "question": "A client presents 7 months postpartum with persistent fatigue, thinning hair, and an inability to lose weight despite a caloric deficit. Based on Advanced Clinical Correlation (L2), which biochemical pathway should be investigated first?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These symptoms are classic indicators of postpartum thyroiditis or endocrine dysfunction within the TAO Axis, which is a primary focus of advanced clinical correlation in L3 practitioners."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "Neuro-Somatic Integration (L3) teaches that 'the body and story' are inseparable. What is the 'Bottom-Up' approach to resolving birth trauma?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Bottom-Up' approach prioritizes the nervous system (soma) first, using techniques like vagal regulation to create safety in the body before the cognitive 'Story' can be successfully integrated."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Advanced Nutritional Bio-Individuality, why is the 'Standard American Diet' (SAD) or even a generic 'healthy' diet often insufficient for a mother in the 'Depletion Recovery' phase?",
            "options": [
                "She needs fewer calories due to decreased activity",
                "Pregnancy and lactation can deplete nutrient stores by up to 30-40%, requiring therapeutic-grade replenishment rather than maintenance",
                "Nutritional needs actually decrease after the first 3 months postpartum",
                "The microbiome is unable to process fiber during the first year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 practitioners recognize that 'Postpartum Depletion' is a physiological state where nutrient stores (DHA, Zinc, Iron, Magnesium) are significantly lower than pre-pregnancy levels, requiring targeted, bio-individual replenishment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity Architecture focuses on resolving the cognitive dissonance between the 'Idealized Mother' archetype and the client's reality, which is a core component of the matrescence transition."

                "Relational conflict, because stress prevents nutrient absorption",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The L3 Practitioner Lens prioritizes physiological stabilization first; a brain that is sleep-deprived and nutrient-depleted lacks the executive function required for complex relational or psychological work."

                "The postpartum period ends at 6 weeks; this is likely a different medical issue",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 practitioners recognize that recovery and matrescence are multi-year processes (often 2-7 years) involving deep tissue remodeling, endocrine rebalancing, and identity integration."
