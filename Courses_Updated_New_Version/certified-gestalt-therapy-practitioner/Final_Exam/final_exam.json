                "Projection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Witness the Now (W) focuses on grounding the client in the immediate 'here and now' specifically to bypass cognitive defenses like intellectualization, where clients talk about feelings rather than experiencing them."

        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "According to Arnold Beisser’s Paradoxical Theory of Change, which is a cornerstone of Gestalt practice, how does authentic change occur?",
            "options": [
                "By striving to become what one 'should' be through willpower.",
                "By rejecting the current self in favor of a future ideal.",
                "By becoming fully aware of and accepting what one currently is.",
                "By analyzing the childhood origins of current behaviors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Paradoxical Theory of Change posits that change occurs when one becomes what he is, not when he tries to become what he is not."

            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "A client consistently swallows the practitioner’s suggestions without questioning them or determining if they fit their own values. In Gestalt terms, which contact boundary disturbance is being demonstrated?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Introjection involves 'swallowing whole' the beliefs and standards of others without critically evaluating or 'digesting' them to see if they align with the self."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt practitioners use phenomenological inquiry to focus on 'how' and 'what' is happening. Asking the client to 'stay with' the sensation heightens awareness of the immediate experience without premature interpretation."

        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "In 'Observe the Field' (O), the practitioner examines the 'organism-environment' field. Which concept describes the psychological tension created by incomplete tasks or unexpressed emotions?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The contact boundary is the interface where the individual meets the environment (or others). Healthy contact involves maintaining a sense of self while engaging with the 'not-self'."

            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "A client expresses that they feel 'everyone in the office is judging me,' despite no evidence of this. This is an example of which boundary disturbance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Stevens et al., 2014) indicates that Gestalt therapy is as effective as other established therapeutic approaches, particularly for depression and anxiety."

            "question": "When working with 'Complex Client Scenarios' (M17), how should a practitioner handle a client who demonstrates 'Retroflection' (e.g., self-harming behaviors or extreme self-criticism)?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the behavior and focus on childhood history.",
                "Help the client redirect the energy outward toward the original target.",
                "Encourage more retroflection to build self-discipline.",
                "Suggest the client take medication immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Retroflection is doing to oneself what one wants to do to others. Therapy involves helping the client identify the impulse and safely redirecting it toward the intended environment/person."

                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Exercises are pre-planned techniques (like a relaxation script), whereas Experiments are phenomenological explorations that grow out of the immediate contact between practitioner and client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt emphasizes the practitioner's presence and awareness. Counter-transference is seen as information about the 'field' and should be processed in supervision to maintain ethical boundaries."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The impasse is the point where the client feels they cannot support themselves or get support from others. The practitioner provides enough environmental support for the client to experience the impasse fully, which leads to creative adjustment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because Gestalt work can be experiential and emotionally intense, clear informed consent regarding the nature of experiments and the client's right to refuse is legally and ethically vital."
