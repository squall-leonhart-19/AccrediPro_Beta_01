            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1, what is the primary characteristic of a 'Fixed Gestalt' that distinguishes it from healthy organismic self-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to adapt to new environmental stimuli quickly",
                "The repetition of a behavioral pattern regardless of its current effectiveness",
                "The complete absence of any contact boundary between the self and others",
                "A state of high awareness and presence in the Here-and-Now"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Fixed Gestalt is characterized by rigidity and the repetition of a response pattern that was once adaptive but is now applied inappropriately to new, different contexts."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Lesson 2 discusses the Zeigarnik Effect. How does this psychological principle explain the persistence of 'Unfinished Business'?",
            "options": [
                "People tend to forget completed tasks more easily than incomplete ones, creating cognitive tension",
                "People only remember events that were traumatic in nature",
                "Unfinished business is stored in the unconscious and can never be recalled",
                "The brain prioritizes completed tasks to ensure maximum efficiency of memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Zeigarnik Effect states that incomplete or interrupted tasks create a psychological tension that keeps them in the 'foreground' of awareness until they are resolved."

            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the 'metabolic' danger of an introject?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the client to physically lose weight due to stress",
                "It is 'swallowed whole' without being 'chewed' or evaluated for its usefulness",
                "It speeds up the client's decision-making process too much",
                "It prevents the client from ever learning new information"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introjection involves accepting beliefs, values, or 'shoulds' from others without critically evaluating ('chewing') them to see if they actually fit the individual's needs."

            "id": "q4_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Retroflection occurs when an individual turns an impulse (like anger) back onto themselves rather than directing it toward the environment or the intended person."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, what is the primary goal of using the 'Empty Chair' technique for a client with a deceased parent?",
            "options": [
                "To prove to the client that the parent is no longer there",
                "To facilitate a 'goodbye' or the expression of unstated feelings to achieve closure",
                "To allow the therapist to play the role of the parent and give advice",
                "To practice cognitive behavioral reframing of the parent's past actions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Empty Chair is used to externalize internal conflict and allow the client to express 'unfinished business' to an imagined other, facilitating completion of the gestalt."

            "id": "q4_6",

                "The rational, logical part of the personality that makes lists",
                "The part that uses excuses, procrastination, and 'trying' to sabotage the Top Dog",
                "The fully integrated self that has resolved all polarities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Underdog is the passive-aggressive, manipulative part of the split that resists the Top Dog's demands through 'trying,' apologizing, and making excuses."

            "options": [
                "It requires immediate medical intervention",
                "It involves a high level of physical danger to the client",
                "It introduces a novel challenge that disrupts the client's habitual, fixed patterns",
                "The therapist creates a crisis to see how the client reacts under pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "It is an 'emergency' because it challenges the status quo and forces the client to find a new way of being, but it is 'safe' because it happens within the therapeutic container."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, moving from 'Stasis to Flow' involves a shift in the contact boundary. Which shift is most desirable?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from a flexible boundary to an impermeable one",
                "Moving from a rigid, fixed boundary to one that is responsive to the environment",
                "Eliminating the contact boundary entirely to achieve confluence",
                "Strengthening the boundary so that no external influence can enter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration and 'flow' involve moving away from rigid, fixed patterns (stasis) toward a boundary that can flexibly open or close based on organismic needs."

            "id": "q4_9",

                "Sit in one chair as the 'Wall' and the other as the 'Self' to explore the dialogue",
                "Take a personality test to determine why they are introverted",
                "Ignore the feeling of the wall and focus on positive affirmations",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Two-Chair work is used to resolve internal polarities or parts of the self, such as the part that creates a 'wall' versus the part that wants connection."

                "90% of clients prefer talk therapy over experiential work",
                "Research on neuroplasticity suggests that new experiences are required to 'rewire' fixed neural pathways",
                "Fixed gestalts are usually resolved within two sessions of talk therapy",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes that 'creative experiments' provide the novel experience necessary to disrupt fixed patterns and facilitate neuroplastic change."
