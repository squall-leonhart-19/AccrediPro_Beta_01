            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core of this theory is that change happens when a person fully accepts and 'is' their current state, rather than striving to be something else."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchoring involves using the body to create a physical 'anchor' or memory of a state of wholeness, making it easier for the client to return to that state in daily life."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
