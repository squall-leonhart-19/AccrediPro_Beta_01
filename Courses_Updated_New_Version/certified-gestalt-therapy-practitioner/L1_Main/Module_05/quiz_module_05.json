            "question": "In Gestalt theory, how is 'Integration' distinguished from simple 'Aggregation'?",
            "options": [
                "Integration is the functional reorganization of the field where parts work as a unified whole.",
                "Integration is the process of adding new behaviors to an existing personality structure.",
                "Aggregation is the final stage of the Cycle of Experience, while integration is the first.",
                "Integration refers only to the cognitive understanding of one's problems."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Integration involves a holistic reorganization where the individual functions as a unified 'Gestalt,' rather than just a collection of disparate traits or behaviors (aggregation)."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A client consistently completes therapeutic tasks but immediately moves to the next goal without acknowledging their success. Which phase of the Cycle of Experience is being interrupted?",

                "Mobilization",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Satisfaction and Withdrawal phases are essential for 'closing the Gestalt.' Skipping these leads to a lack of nourishment from achievements and creates a backlog of unfinished business."

                "The rational part of the self that seeks logical compromise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the Top Dog is the 'righteous bully,' the Underdog is the 'passive-aggressive' part that stays in control by being lazy, inept, or constantly promising to change 'tomorrow' (mañana)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Perls defined the maturation process as the transition from environmental support (relying on others for validation and regulation) to self-support (relying on one's own organismic resources)."

                "To distract the client from painful emotional memories.",
                "To create a physical reference point that 'locks in' a new psychological state or insight.",
                "To increase the client's heart rate to facilitate emotional catharsis.",
                "To replace the need for verbal communication between therapist and client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchoring uses the body to ground an insight, making the integration physical rather than just intellectual, which helps the client recall the state outside of the session."

                "A medical emergency that requires immediate intervention.",
                "A role-play where the therapist takes on the role of the client's parent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An experiment is a 'safe emergency'—it provides enough 'heat' to facilitate change and new awareness while providing the 'safety' of the therapeutic container."

                "To ensure every single problem the client has ever had is completely resolved.",
                "To ignore minor issues to focus on the client's future goals.",
                "To facilitate the processing of the relationship's end to prevent it from becoming a 'fixed gestalt.'",
                "To extend therapy indefinitely until the client feels no anxiety about leaving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Termination is itself a phase of the Cycle of Experience. If not processed (Final Contact), the ending becomes 'unfinished business' that can hinder the client's future growth."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A client in an empty chair experiment realizes their 'Inner Critic' (Top Dog) is actually an introjected voice of a protective grandparent. This shift from 'conflict' to 'understanding' is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis occurs when the client moves beyond the 'battle' between two sides and recognizes the underlying function or value of both, leading to an integrated self."

                "Increased reliance on external authority for decision-making.",
                "A 40% decrease in the ability to tolerate environmental frustration.",
                "Higher levels of resilience and a decrease in chronic 'unfinished business.'",
                "A total elimination of the 'Underdog' personality trait."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
