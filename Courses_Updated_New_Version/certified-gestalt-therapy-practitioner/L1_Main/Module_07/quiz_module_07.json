            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Presence,' what is the primary distinction between 'observing' a client and 'witnessing' them?",
            "options": [
                "Observing is subjective, while witnessing is purely objective and detached.",
                "Witnessing is a co-created state of phenomenological presence where the practitioner holds the client's experience without the intent to manipulate or change it.",
                "Witnessing requires the practitioner to record the session for later analysis, whereas observing is done in real-time.",
                "Observing focuses on the client's past, while witnessing focuses on the client's future potential."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Witnessing is an advanced state of 'being with' that emphasizes phenomenological presence and the co-creation of a safe field, moving beyond mere clinical observation to a shared relational experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Intermediate Zone (or Middle Zone) involves mental activity like worrying, planning, and reminiscing, which Gestalt therapy often seeks to bridge back to the Inner or Outer zones for grounded awareness."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt Field Theory, the 'charge' or shift in energy is seen as a phenomenon of the field itself, manifesting at the contact boundary between the organism and the environment (therapist/client)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapy uses the metaphor of 'mental metabolism,' where clients must 'chew' (critically examine) introjected beliefs to decide what truly fits their current self-identity."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Safe Emergency' is the 'sweet spot' of Gestalt experimentation where there is enough frustration to prompt growth but enough support to prevent overwhelming the client's system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is the process where the 'fixed' becomes fluid and the 'disowned' (alienated parts of self) are brought back into the person's functional awareness and identity."

            "question": "A client is stuck in a chronic 'fixed' introject: 'I must never show anger.' During an experiment, the practitioner asks them to say 'I am angry' while noticing their breath. This is an example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By asking the client to vocalize the feeling while staying present with physical sensations (breath), the practitioner is helping the client move from the 'Intermediate Zone' (the rule) to the 'Inner Zone' (the actual experience)."
