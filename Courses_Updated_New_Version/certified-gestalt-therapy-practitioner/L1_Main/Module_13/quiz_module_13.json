            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt therapy, the field is a dynamic, co-created phenomenon where the therapist and client are inseparable parts of a single system in the present moment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic resonance involves using the practitioner's own bodily sensations as a 'tuning fork' to pick up on the client's disowned or out-of-awareness experiences."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing resistance as creative adjustment acknowledges that the behavior was a functional response to a past environment, even if it is no longer useful in the present."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "Empathy is professional, while inclusion is considered a boundary violation.",
                "Inclusion involves experiencing the client's world while remaining grounded in one's own separate reality.",
                "Empathy is only for beginners, while inclusion is for advanced practitioners.",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in Gestalt literature."
