                "The client must exert significant willpower to change their behavior.",
                "The practitioner must provide a clear roadmap for the client's future self.",
                "The client must fully become who they are in the present moment rather than trying to become who they are not.",
                "The client must resolve all past traumas before the field can shift."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beisser's theory posits that change does not occur through a forced attempt to change, but rather when one abandons the struggle to be different and fully invests in their current reality."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed Gestalt emphasizes safety and 'titration' (breaking the experience into manageable pieces) to avoid re-traumatization and flooding the client's nervous system."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A client consistently clenches their jaw and bites their own lip whenever they begin to feel anger toward their partner. In Gestalt terms, this is a clear example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Fertile Void is the 'middle point' or 'point of indifference' where the client experiences a lack of direction that is actually the precursor to new creative adjustments."

                "The Master focuses on the client's history rather than the present.",
