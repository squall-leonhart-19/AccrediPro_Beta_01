            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "In the context of Somatic Resonance (Lesson 1), what is the primary purpose of the therapist attending to their own bodily sensations during a session?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the client's specific physical ailments using medical intuition",
                "To use their own 'inter-corporeality' as a diagnostic tool for the client's unspoken field dynamics",
                "To distract themselves from the client's emotional intensity to maintain professional distance",
                "To model proper posture and breathing techniques for the client to imitate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic resonance allows the therapist to use their own body as a sensitive instrument to pick up on the 'background' of the field and the client's embodied experience that hasn't yet reached verbal awareness."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Advanced Field Theory (Lesson 2) posits that 'pathology' is best understood as:",
            "options": [
                "An internal chemical imbalance within the individual's brain",
                "A fixed personality trait that remains constant across all environments",
                "A creative adjustment to a specific field that has become rigid or out of sync with the current environment",
                "A failure of the client to follow the therapist's directives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt Field Theory, what we call symptoms are seen as 'creative adjustments' that were once necessary for survival in a previous field but have become 'fixed' and no longer serve the organism in the present."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "When deconstructing an Introject (Lesson 3), which process is essential for the client to 'digest' the internalized belief?",
            "options": [
                "Blindly accepting the therapist's counter-beliefs to replace the old ones",
                "A process of 'mental metabolism' involving critical questioning, chewing, and deciding what to keep or discard",
                "Suppressing the voice of the Internalized Critic through positive affirmations",
                "Ignoring the introject until it eventually fades away from lack of attention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introjects are 'swallowed whole.' Healing involves 'chewing' the material—breaking it down, analyzing it, and deciding which parts are nourishing and which are toxic, rather than just replacing one introject with another."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A client frequently clenches their jaw and bites their lip whenever they feel frustrated with the therapist. In Gestalt terms (Lesson 4), this is a classic example of:",

                "Projection",
                "Confluence",
                "Retroflection",
                "Deflection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Retroflection occurs when an individual does to themselves what they would like to do to someone else, or what they would like someone else to do to them. Clenching the jaw instead of expressing anger is a physical retroflection."

                "The individual progress of the most vocal member of the group",
                "The immediate, phenomenological experience of the group as a whole in the present moment",
                "The planning of future goals and social activities outside of the group"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Collective Now' shifts the focus from individual 'work' in the presence of others to the interactive field of the group itself—how the members are relating and what is emerging in the room right now."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 describes the 'Frozen Gestalt' in trauma as a state where:",
            "options": [
                "The client has completely forgotten the traumatic event",
                "The organism's self-regulation is suspended because the cycle of contact was interrupted by overwhelming threat",
                "The client is pretending to be emotional to gain the therapist's sympathy",
                "The therapist becomes 'frozen' and unable to help the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Frozen Gestalt is an incomplete cycle of contact where the energy mobilized for fight/flight was never discharged or completed, leaving the trauma 'stuck' in the body and the field."

            "options": [
                "Ensuring the experiment is as dramatic and emotional as possible",
                "Gaining informed consent and ensuring the experiment is graded to the client's current level of support",
                "Making sure the therapist knows exactly what the outcome will be before starting",
                "Requiring the client to finish the experiment even if they become highly distressed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Experiments must be co-created and 'graded.' If an experiment provides too much frustration without enough support, it can become anti-therapeutic or re-traumatizing."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "According to the I-Thou relationship framework (Lesson 8), the 'Dialogic' therapist:",
            "options": [
                "Remains a 'blank slate' to encourage client projections",
                "Maintains a position of absolute authority and expertise",
                "Shows up as a whole person, practicing presence, inclusion, and a commitment to the 'between'",
                "Focuses solely on the client's behavior without sharing any of their own reactions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The I-Thou relationship requires the therapist to be present as a human being (Presence) and to try to feel the client's world as if from the inside (Inclusion) without losing their own sense of self."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client who insists that 'everyone in my office is out to get me' but is unable to recognize their own competitive and aggressive behavior is likely engaging in (Lesson 4):",

                "Retroflection",
                "Projection",
                "Egotism",
                "Introjection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projection involves disowning a part of the self (in this case, aggression) and attributing it to the environment or others."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Paradoxical Theory of Change' as applied in Module 14?",
            "options": [
                "Change occurs when the therapist forces the client to be different",
                "Change occurs when one becomes what he is, not when he tries to become what he is not",
                "Change is impossible in Gestalt therapy because the past cannot be altered",
                "Change only happens when the client masters complex cognitive behavioral techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beisser's Paradoxical Theory of Change is central to Gestalt: growth happens through full acceptance of the current reality ('what is') rather than striving toward an 'ideal' self."
