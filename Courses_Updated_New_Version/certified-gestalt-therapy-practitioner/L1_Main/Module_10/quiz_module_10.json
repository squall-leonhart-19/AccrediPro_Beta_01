            "question": "According to the Paradoxical Theory of Change (Beisser, 1970), how does sustainable psychological change occur?",
            "options": [
                "By setting rigorous goals and using willpower to overcome resistance.",
                "When the individual fully accepts and becomes what they currently are.",
                "Through the therapist's expert interpretation of the client's past.",
                "By focusing exclusively on future possibilities and 'acting as if'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Paradoxical Theory of Change posits that change occurs when one becomes what he is, not when he tries to become what he is not. Effortful change often creates internal conflict, whereas acceptance facilitates natural movement."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic neck tension and frequently bites their lip when discussing a difficult spouse. In Gestalt terms, this 'somatic hold' is a primary indicator of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Retroflection is the process of doing to oneself what one originally wanted to do to someone else or having done to them. Somatic symptoms like muscle tension are often the physical manifestation of held-back energy."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In the context of Gestalt trauma work (Lesson 2), what is a 'fixed gestalt'?",
            "options": [
                "A healthy, completed cycle of experience.",
                "A rigid pattern of response that was once adaptive but now interferes with current functioning.",
                "The therapist's unwavering focus on the client's body language.",
                "A state of total emotional regulation and balance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma often results in 'fixed gestalts'—repetitive, rigid ways of being in the world that were necessary for survival during the trauma but prevent the individual from responding flexibly to the present environment."

            "options": [
                "The client is pushed into a crisis to force a breakthrough.",
                "The therapist ensures the client feels no discomfort whatsoever.",
                "A low-risk environment where the client can try a new behavior that feels challenging.",
                "A situation where the therapist takes full responsibility for the client's emotional safety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'safe emergency' is a controlled therapeutic environment where the client feels safe enough to take a risk (the emergency) by trying on a new way of being or expressing a suppressed emotion."

            "id": "q10_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introjection involves taking in information, values, or 'shoulds' from the environment without digesting or questioning them, leading to an 'internalized' voice that isn't truly the individual's own."

                "The therapist must direct the client toward specific outcomes.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Field Theory posits that everything is relational. The 'field' is the organism-plus-environment, and the therapeutic encounter is co-created by the interaction between the therapist and client."

                "To vent anger so it is no longer felt.",
                "To achieve integration and closure of a previously interrupted cycle of experience.",
                "To convince the other person (in reality) to change their behavior.",
                "To prove that the client was right and the other person was wrong."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of Empty Chair work in Gestalt is to bring the 'Unfinished Business' into the present, allow the client to express withheld feelings, and ultimately integrate the experience so it no longer drains their energy."

            "id": "q10_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confluence occurs when the boundary between the self and the environment becomes blurred. The individual 'flows' with others to avoid conflict or the anxiety of being separate."

            "question": "Within the W.H.O.L.E. Framework™ (Lesson 8), the 'H' stands for 'Holistic Awareness.' This specifically requires the practitioner to:",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Holistic Awareness in the W.H.O.L.E. Framework™ emphasizes the integration of the whole person—body, mind, and spirit—within their current environment."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A therapist notices a client is 'deflecting' (changing the subject) whenever the topic of their father arises. What is the most 'Gestalt' way to intervene?",
            "options": [
                "Interpret the deflection as a sign of deep-seated Oedipal conflict.",
                "Ask the client: 'I notice you make a joke every time I mention your father; what are you experiencing right now?'",
                "Force the client to talk about their father to break through the resistance.",
                "Follow the client's lead and talk about the new subject to maintain rapport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapy uses phenomenological inquiry. By bringing awareness to the *process* of deflection in the 'here-and-now,' the therapist helps the client become aware of how they are avoiding contact."
