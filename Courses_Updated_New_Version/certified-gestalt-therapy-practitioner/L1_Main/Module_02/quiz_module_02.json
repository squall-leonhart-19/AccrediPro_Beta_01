            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1, what is the primary goal of maintaining the 'Continuum of Awareness' during a session?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client stays focused on their childhood memories",
                "To facilitate the natural flow of experience without interruption or avoidance",
                "To help the client achieve a state of total relaxation and meditation",
                "To categorize every thought into a specific psychological diagnosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Continuum of Awareness is the ongoing flow of experiencing. The goal is to help the client stay with their immediate experience, allowing 'gestalts' to form and dissolve naturally."

            "options": [
                "The Internal Zone (Inner)",
                "The Intermediate Zone (DMZ)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The External Zone (Outer Zone) involves sensory contact with the environment through the five senses, such as touch, sight, and sound."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client says, 'I feel a sudden tightness in my chest and my breathing is becoming shallow.' This is an example of heightening awareness in which zone?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Internal Zone (Inner Zone) comprises somatic interoception, including visceral sensations, muscle tension, and physiological responses like breathing."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Why is the Intermediate Zone often referred to as the 'DMZ' (Demilitarized Zone) in Gestalt therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is a safe space where no psychological work happens",
                "Because it acts as a buffer of 'aboutism'—thinking and fantasizing—that can prevent contact with the Here-and-Now",
                "Because it is where the practitioner and client negotiate the therapeutic contract",
                "Because it represents the client's unconscious defense mechanisms against the therapist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Intermediate Zone (Middle Zone) involves mental activity like ruminating, planning, and judging. While useful, it can become a 'DMZ' that prevents direct contact with internal or external reality."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In Figure-Ground dynamics, what happens when a 'need' or 'interest' is fully satisfied or completed?",
            "options": [
                "The figure recedes into the background (ground), allowing a new figure to emerge",
                "The figure becomes permanently fixed in the client's awareness",
                "The background (ground) disappears entirely",
                "The client enters a state of 'confluence' with the environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Healthy Gestalt formation involves a clear figure emerging from the ground; once the need is met, the figure recedes, and the ground becomes available for the next emerging need."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Resistance' as a 'Protective Shield.' How should a Gestalt practitioner view a client's resistance?",
            "options": [
                "As an obstacle that must be broken down as quickly as possible",
                "As a sign that the client is not ready for therapy and should be referred out",
                "As a creative adjustment and an active expression of the client's current boundaries",
                "As a lack of motivation or 'laziness' on the part of the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt practitioners view resistance not as a negative force, but as a 'creative adjustment'—a way the client has learned to protect themselves. We work *with* the resistance rather than against it."

            "options": [
                "To correct the client's grammar and syntax",
                "To help the client take ownership of their experience and increase 'I-ness'",
                "To minimize the emotional impact of the statement",
                "To focus the session on the external cause of the sadness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Moving from 'It' language to 'I' language encourages the client to take responsibility for their feelings and increases their sense of agency."

                "The Practitioner’s Use of Self to provide phenomenological feedback",
                "An interpretation of the client's unconscious anxiety",
                "A diagnostic assessment of restless leg syndrome",
                "A distraction from the client's verbal narrative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "By sharing immediate, non-judgmental observations (phenomenological feedback), the practitioner uses their own awareness to help the client notice their own somatic expressions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Based on the case studies in Module 2, if a client is stuck 'in their head' (Intermediate Zone) ruminating about a future event, which intervention would most effectively ground them in the present?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client to explain the history of their anxiety",
                "Directing the client to notice five things they can see and four things they can hear right now",

                "Reassuring the client that everything will be okay"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shifting the client from the Intermediate Zone (rumination) to the External Zone (sensory contact) is a primary technique for grounding a client in the Here-and-Now."

            "question": "Arnold Beisser’s 'Paradoxical Theory of Change,' mentioned in the module, suggests that change occurs when:",
            "options": [
                "The client tries as hard as possible to be someone else",
                "The practitioner uses forceful persuasion to change the client's mind",
                "The client becomes what they are, rather than trying to become what they are not",
                "The client masters the use of Intermediate Zone thinking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beisser (1970) posited that change does not occur through a forced attempt to change, but when one becomes fully aware of and accepts what they currently are."
