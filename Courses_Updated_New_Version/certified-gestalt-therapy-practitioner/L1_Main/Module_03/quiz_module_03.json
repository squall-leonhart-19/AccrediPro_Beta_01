            "question": "According to Kurt Lewin's Field Theory (1951), which foundational formula describes the relationship between the individual and their environment?",
            "options": [
                "B = f(P, E) - Behavior is a function of the Person and their Environment",
                "E = mc2 - Energy is the product of mass and the speed of light",
                "P = f(B, C) - Personality is a function of Behavior and Culture",
                "C = f(S, O) - Contact is a function of Self and Other"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lewin's formula B = f(P, E) is the cornerstone of Field Theory, asserting that behavior is not just internal but an emergent property of the person interacting within their specific psychological field or environment."

            "options": [
                "A rigid wall that protects the individual from external threats",
                "The point where the 'me' and the 'not-me' meet, facilitate exchange, and define identity",
                "An internal psychological barrier that prevents traumatic memories from surfacing",
                "A social contract between the therapist and the client regarding session timing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The contact boundary is the site of psychological growth; it is where the organism meets the environment to satisfy needs and differentiate itself from others."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client frequently uses the phrase 'I should always put others first' without ever questioning where this belief came from. In Module 3, this contact style is identified as:",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Introjection involves 'swallowing whole' the values, beliefs, or rules of others (usually authority figures) without digesting or critically evaluating them for personal fit."

                "The client becoming overly critical of the therapist's methods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While confluence can be healthy (e.g., a shared ritual), pathologically it leads to a blurring of boundaries where the person can no longer distinguish their own needs from those of the other."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The I-Thou perspective is a cornerstone of Gestalt's relational field, emphasizing horizontal, authentic, and mutual human-to-human connection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A fixed gestalt happens when unfinished business or rigid patterns stay in the foreground, blocking the organism's ability to respond to current environmental needs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic resonance involves the therapist using their own somatic and emotional responses as 'instruments' to sense what is happening in the shared relational field."
