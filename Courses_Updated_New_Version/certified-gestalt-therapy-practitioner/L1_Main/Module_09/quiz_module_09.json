            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Zeigarnik Effect explains why 'unfinished business' persists in our awareness; the mind remains under tension until a 'gestalt' is completed."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Confluence occurs when the boundary between the self and the environment becomes so thin that the individual loses their sense of separate identity, often seen in the use of 'we' instead of 'I'."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration is the process of bringing together fragmented parts of the self (including disowned feelings or introjects) so the client can act with full self-awareness and agency."
