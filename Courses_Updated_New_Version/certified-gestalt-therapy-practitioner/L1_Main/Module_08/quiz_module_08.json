            "options": [
                "It focuses exclusively on relaxing the muscles to reduce stress.",
                "It involves moving from 'thinking about' the body to 'inhabiting' the somatic experience as a source of truth.",
                "It is a cognitive exercise used to label different body parts.",
                "It requires the client to perform specific athletic movements to release trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Embodiment in Gestalt moves beyond cognitive observation into 'lived experience,' where the body is treated as the primary site of integration rather than just an object to be observed."

                "By using logic and moral superiority to shame the other parts.",
                "Through passive-aggressive resistance, procrastination, and 'yes, but' excuses.",
                "By physically manifesting as tension in the shoulders and neck."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Underdog controls the field through 'passive resistance,' sabotaging the Top Dog's demands with excuses and procrastination rather than direct opposition."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the Zeigarnik Effect in relation to 'Closing the Gestalt Circle.' What does this psychological principle suggest?",
            "options": [
                "People remember completed tasks better than incomplete ones.",
                "Incomplete tasks or 'unfinished business' create a persistent psychic tension that demands resolution.",
                "The brain automatically deletes traumatic memories that are not integrated within 48 hours.",
                "Closure is an illusion and the human mind prefers open-ended narratives."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Zeigarnik Effect demonstrates that incomplete tasks (unfinished Gestalts) stay active in our cognitive and emotional field, creating tension until they are resolved."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal is integration, not elimination. By facilitating dialogue between fragments, the client moves toward a unified, authentic expression of self."

                "To frustrate the client's desire for environmental support so they are forced to find internal resources.",
                "To end the session immediately as it has reached a 'dead end.'",
                "To distract the client with relaxation techniques."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt, the practitioner 'frustrates' the client's habitual reliance on others, encouraging them to cross the impasse by developing their own self-support."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A client feels a 'lump in their throat' when talking about their father but says 'everything is fine.' According to Lesson 4 on Somatic Anchoring, what is the first step for the practitioner?",

                "Suggest the client drinks water to clear the sensation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt practitioners prioritize the somatic 'obvious.' Directing awareness to the physical sensation helps bridge the gap between the phony layer and actual experience."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Research cited in the module regarding Gestalt 'Empty Chair' work for unfinished business (e.g., Greenberg & Malcolm, 2002) shows that successful resolution is highly correlated with:",
