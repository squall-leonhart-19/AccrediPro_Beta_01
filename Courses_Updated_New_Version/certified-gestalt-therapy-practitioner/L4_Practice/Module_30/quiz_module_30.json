                "Strict adherence to diagnostic manuals",
                "The use of pre-planned interpretive scripts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gestalt Persona emphasizes the therapist's use of self as a tool, prioritizing an authentic 'I-Thou' relationship while maintaining professional safety and boundaries."

            "id": "q30_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, why is a robust 'Informed Consent' document particularly critical for Gestalt practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client knows the therapist is always right",
                "To explain the potential for intense emotional arousal and the experiential nature of the work",
                "To prevent the client from ever asking questions about the process",
                "To legally waive the therapist's responsibility for client outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because Gestalt therapy involves experiential 'experiments' and intense 'here-and-now' work, informed consent must clearly outline the nature of these interventions to protect both the client and the practitioner."

                "Focus exclusively on price competition to attract clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic niche development suggests that creating a specific category (e.g., 'Gestalt for Creative Professionals') is more effective than trying to compete as a generalist."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relational marketing views the referral network as an extension of the 'field,' where authentic connections with other professionals lead to high-quality, sustainable referrals."

            "options": [
                "They make the therapy sessions more rigid and predictable",
                "They reduce cognitive load and 'open loops,' allowing the therapist to be more fully present with clients",
                "They replace the need for clinical supervision",
                "They are only useful for large clinics, not solo practitioners"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By systematizing administrative tasks, the practitioner reduces mental clutter and stress, which directly supports their ability to maintain 'presence' during sessions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the impact and results of the therapy, positioning the service as an investment in the client's growth rather than just a trade of time for money."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is achieved by evolving the practice to include different modes of work, which prevents the monotony and exhaustion often associated with high-volume 1:1 clinical work."
