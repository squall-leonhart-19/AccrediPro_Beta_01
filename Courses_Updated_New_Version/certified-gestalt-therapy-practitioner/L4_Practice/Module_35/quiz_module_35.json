            "question": "In Lesson 1, what is defined as the 'primary risk' when scaling a Gestalt practice from a solo operation to a larger organization?",
            "options": [
                "The loss of phenomenological presence and the 'I-Thou' connection in favor of efficiency",
                "Decreased profit margins due to increased administrative overhead",
                "Difficulty in finding practitioners who have completed exactly 500 clinical hours",
                "The legal complexity of registering a multi-state corporation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Scaling with integrity requires maintaining the core Gestalt value of presence. The primary risk is that the 'I-Thou' relationship becomes a transactional 'I-It' relationship as the focus shifts to volume and efficiency."

            "id": "q35_2",
            "question": "When applying 'Collaborative Field Dynamics' to a group practice model (Lesson 2), how should the organization be viewed?",

                "As a competitive environment designed to maximize individual practitioner billing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt group practice models view the organization as a 'Unified Field.' This means the health and dynamics of the staff directly impact the therapeutic field of the clients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Digital Contact Gap refers to the reduction in sensory data online. Coaches bridge this by being more transparent about their own immediate experience (phenomenology) to foster connection."
