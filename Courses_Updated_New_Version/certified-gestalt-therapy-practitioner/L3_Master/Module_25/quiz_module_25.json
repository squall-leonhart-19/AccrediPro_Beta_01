            "question": "In the Philosophy of Gestalt Supervision, what is the primary distinction between 'traditional' supervision and the 'Gestalt' approach?",
            "options": [
                "Traditional supervision focuses on the supervisee's childhood, while Gestalt focuses on the client's childhood.",
                "Gestalt supervision prioritizes the 'Between'—the phenomenological field emergent between supervisor and supervisee—rather than just clinical correction.",
                "Traditional supervision is purely didactic, while Gestalt supervision is purely experimental without theoretical grounding.",
                "Gestalt supervision avoids the use of any clinical diagnosis, whereas traditional supervision requires it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt supervision shifts the focus from a top-down correction of the supervisee to an exploration of the relational field and the 'Between,' emphasizing phenomenological awareness."

                "Historical Context; analyzing the supervisee's past training exclusively.",
                "Heuristic Evaluation; using a checklist of 50 clinical competencies.",
                "Holistic Field Awareness; attending to the environmental, relational, and internal factors influencing the therapeutic triad.",
                "Humanistic Regard; maintaining a positive attitude toward the supervisee regardless of performance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'H' stands for Holistic Field Awareness, which requires the mentor to look beyond the individual to the entire field, including the client, therapist, and systemic influences."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "A supervisee describes feeling 'stuck' and 'bored' with a client. During the session, the supervisor begins to feel unusually lethargic and disinterested. This is an example of:",

                "Countertransference failure on the part of the supervisor.",
                "The Parallel Process, where the dynamics of the client-therapist relationship are mirrored in the supervisor-supervisee relationship.",

                "The 'Empty Chair' dynamic being applied incorrectly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel process occurs when the supervisee unconsciously recreates the client's dynamics or the therapeutic struggle within the supervisory relationship, providing a 'live' field for intervention."

                "The requirement to interrupt the supervisee every 10 minutes to check for awareness.",

                "The mandate to only use 'I' statements during feedback.",
                "The process of categorizing supervisee behaviors into specific diagnostic criteria."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epoche (bracketing) is a core phenomenological principle where the supervisor sets aside preconceptions to remain open to the immediate experience of the supervisee."

                "Through transparency, acknowledging the 'horizontal' relational contact while respecting the 'vertical' responsibility of clinical oversight.",
                "By allowing the supervisee to set all the ethical guidelines for the relationship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced L3 supervision balances the 'I-Thou' horizontal relationship with the vertical reality of the supervisor's legal and ethical responsibility for clinical outcomes."

                "It is more cost-effective for the supervisor.",
                "It allows for 'Witnessing' and a more complex 'Field' where multiple perspectives enhance the phenomenological data.",
                "It reduces the amount of time the supervisor has to speak.",
                "It prevents parallel processes from occurring because there are too many people."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group supervision provides a richer 'field' and allows members to act as witnesses, which amplifies awareness and provides diverse perspectives on clinical dynamics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Level 3 supervisees (Integrated/Autonomous) show stable motivation and a consolidated professional identity, allowing for more collaborative and nuanced supervision."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Liminality refers to the 'in-between' state of uncertainty. In Gestalt supervision, these moments of 'not knowing' or resistance are leveraged as opportunities for creative breakthroughs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt supervision views diversity as part of the field; therefore, the supervisor must proactively address how these dynamics influence the relationship and the clinical work."

            "question": "Cultivating the 'Supervisor's Presence' (Lesson 8) involves 'Modeling the Methodology.' This means:",
            "options": [
                "The supervisor should act like a 'blank slate' to avoid influencing the supervisee.",
                "The supervisor should demonstrate Gestalt principles (like presence and contact) within the supervisory relationship as a teaching tool.",
                "The supervisor should perform a therapy session on the supervisee every week.",
                "The supervisor should only use video recordings of famous Gestalt therapists."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modeling the methodology means the supervisor embodies the Gestalt values of awareness, presence, and contact during the supervision, providing a living example for the supervisee."
