            "options": [
                "By the therapist actively persuading the client to adopt healthier behaviors through cognitive restructuring.",
                "When the client fully invests in becoming who they currently are, rather than trying to become someone else.",
                "Through the consistent application of willpower and self-discipline to override characterological defenses.",
                "By focusing exclusively on future goals and disregarding current phenomenological experiences."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beisser (1970) posited that change does not occur through a coercive attempt by the individual or another person to change them, but it occurs when one takes the time and effort to be what they are."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Kinesthetic resonance is the therapist's ability to use their own bodily sensations as a 'tuned instrument' to sense the subtle somatic communications and field dynamics present in the encounter."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt theory, character is seen as a set of 'Fixed Gestalts'—behaviors that were once necessary for survival or adjustment but have lost their fluidity and no longer serve the current field."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced Field Theory recognizes that the 'field' is not just the room, but includes the macro-systems (culture, economy, systemic oppression) that shape the organism's experience."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bracketing involves the therapist intentionally setting aside their own 'theories' and 'preconceptions' to remain open to the unique phenomenon of the client."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical mastery involves 'Power-with,' where the therapist acknowledges the inherent power imbalance but works to minimize its coercive potential through transparency and dialogue."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves respecting the client's 'resistance' or rigidity as a survival strategy. By exploring its function (Paradoxical Theory of Change), the rigidity often begins to soften naturally."
