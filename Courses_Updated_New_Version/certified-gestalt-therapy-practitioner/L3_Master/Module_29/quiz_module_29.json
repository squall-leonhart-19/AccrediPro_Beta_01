            "options": [
                "The practitioner's ability to maintain 'Resonant Presence' where they feel the field's shifts within their own somatic experience.",
                "The use of standardized diagnostic checklists during the session.",
                "Maintaining a strictly neutral and detached emotional distance from the client.",
                "Focusing exclusively on the client's verbal narrative while ignoring non-verbal cues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Advanced Witnessing involves 'Resonant Presence,' where the practitioner uses their own body as a fine-tuned instrument to sense shifts in the relational field."

            "question": "When working with 'Micro-Phenomenology' (L2), what is the primary objective of slowing down the 'Somatic Edge'?",
            "options": [
                "To induce a state of deep hypnotic trance in the client.",
                "To capture the pre-reflective, split-second sensations that precede a fixed emotional response.",
                "To provide the practitioner more time to take detailed clinical notes.",
                "To discourage the client from expressing intense emotions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-phenomenology focuses on the 'granularity' of experience, specifically the pre-reflective moments where a sensation begins before it is labeled as a specific emotion or 'fixed gestalt'."

            "id": "q29_3",

            "options": [
                "By analyzing the client's childhood dreams for recurring symbols.",
                "By identifying 'swallowed whole' beliefs that result in a lack of contact and incongruence with the client's current organismic needs.",
                "By asking the client to list all the rules their parents taught them.",
                "By performing a standardized personality assessment (e.g., MMPI)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introjects are identified when the client operates on 'borrowed' beliefs that clash with their current field conditions and organismic needs, leading to a 'split' in the self."

                "Ignoring the tension and focusing solely on the client's cognitive insights.",

                "Telling the client to simply 'relax' and stop holding the tension."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners view 'armor' as a creative adjustment. By honoring its protective function, the client can eventually choose to soften it rather than feeling attacked by the therapist."

            "options": [
                "The experiment must be planned at least three sessions in advance.",
                "The experiment must provide enough challenge to create 'arousal' for growth while maintaining enough support to prevent retraumatization.",
                "The therapist must be the one to decide exactly how the experiment ends.",
                "The experiment must involve at least one other person besides the therapist and client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Safe Emergency' balances challenge (the emergency) with adequate relational and self-support (the safety) to facilitate integration."

            "options": [
                "Because it allows the client to take a break from the hard work of therapy.",
                "Because it is the state of 'no-thingness' where old patterns have dissolved but new gestalts have not yet formed, allowing for genuine emergence.",
                "Because it is a sign that the practitioner needs to change their therapeutic approach.",
                "Because it forces the client to rely more heavily on the therapist's advice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Fertile Void is the 'center' of the impasse where the client stops 'trying' and begins 'being,' which is the prerequisite for the emergence of a new gestalt."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Organismic Regulation refers to the process by which the individual (and the dyad) moves toward balance and the satisfaction of the most pressing figure in the field."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "Regarding 'Legacy and Ethics' (L8), what is a 'Master Practitioner's' primary responsibility when experiencing a strong counter-transference reaction?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately share every feeling with the client to ensure total transparency.",
                "To suppress the feeling and maintain a professional facade.",
                "To use 'Brackets' to set it aside or, if relevant to the field, use it as 'Phenomenological Disclosure' to serve the client's growth.",
                "To end the therapeutic relationship immediately due to a conflict of interest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves discerning when self-disclosure serves the client's awareness (Phenomenological Disclosure) versus when it is the practitioner's own 'unfinished business' that needs to be 'bracketed'."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis mentioned in the module regarding 'Somatic Awareness' found that clients who could identify specific physiological markers (Micro-Phenomenology) showed:",
            "options": [
                "A 40% increase in intellectual IQ scores.",
                "A significant decrease in amygdala reactivity and higher emotional resilience scores (d=0.82).",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developing 'somatic granularity' (the ability to sense specific bodily changes) is scientifically linked to better emotional regulation and reduced limbic system over-reactivity."

                "Ask the client to 'be the fog' and describe the field from that perspective (Experimentation).",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "By 'becoming' the fog, the client moves from talking 'about' the experience to 'being' in the experience, allowing the underlying gestalt (the need or fear) to emerge."
