            "question": "In Gestalt crisis intervention, the therapist's role as a 'Witness' is primarily intended to achieve which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a corrective emotional experience through sympathy",
                "To ground the client in the current field and prevent psychic fragmentation",
                "To analyze the childhood origins of the current crisis",
                "To direct the client toward immediate problem-solving strategies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Witness' provides a stable point of contact in the field, helping the client remain grounded in the 'here-and-now' to prevent the ego-fragmentation often seen in acute crisis."

            "question": "When exploring the 'Phenomenology of Despair' in suicidal clients, a Gestalt practitioner identifies the suicidal ideation as:",
            "options": [
                "A fixed gestalt where the future is perceived as an unavailable or non-existent field",
                "A manipulative contact interruption used to gain attention",
                "A purely biological imbalance requiring immediate medication over therapy",
                "A sign that the client has reached the final stage of the Cycle of Experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Suicidality is viewed phenomenologically as a 'fixed gestalt' where the client's field has narrowed so significantly that the future is no longer perceived as a space for possibility."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "In the treatment of Complex PTSD (C-PTSD), why is 'titrating awareness' considered a critical clinical necessity?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client remains in a state of high emotional arousal",
                "To move through the Cycle of Experience as quickly as possible",
                "To prevent 'flooding' and re-traumatization by managing the intensity of contact with traumatic memories",
                "To encourage the client to use more projection as a defense mechanism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves carefully managing the 'dose' of traumatic material the client contacts, ensuring they stay within their 'window of tolerance' to avoid re-traumatization."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Gestalt therapy views 'splitting' in borderline dynamics not as a character flaw, but as:",
            "options": [
                "A failure of the cognitive functions",
                "A creative adjustment to manage overwhelming instability in the relational field",
                "An intentional attempt to frustrate the therapist",
                "A lack of introjection during the oral stage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Splitting (viewing things as all good or all bad) is seen as a creative adjustment that helps the individual navigate a field that feels dangerously unpredictable."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In cases of narcissistic vulnerability, the 'fragile self' often utilizes 'egotism' as a contact interruption to:",

                "Ensure the Cycle of Experience is completed fully",

                "Increase the level of confluence in the therapeutic relationship"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Egotism, in the Gestalt sense, involves the client becoming a spectator of their own life to avoid the raw vulnerability and potential shame of genuine contact."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "How does the 'Compulsive Gestalt' in addiction differ from a healthy Cycle of Experience?",
            "options": [
                "It skips the sensation phase entirely",
                "It involves a truncated cycle where the urge moves directly to action, bypassing full awareness and contact",
                "It is characterized by an excess of retrospective reflection",
                "It follows the cycle perfectly but at a much faster speed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In addiction, the 'urge' creates a short-circuit in the Cycle of Experience, leading the individual from sensation/mobilization directly to action (use) without the intervening stage of clear awareness."

            "options": [
                "To maintain absolute confidentiality to protect the therapeutic alliance",
                "To use the 'empty chair' technique to resolve the client's anger",
                "To prioritize the duty to protect/warn, as the safety of the field supersedes individual confidentiality",
                "To wait until the next session to see if the 'fixed gestalt' has shifted"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-risk decision-making requires the therapist to recognize when the safety of the broader field (the public/victim) outweighs the private field of the therapeutic relationship."

            "id": "q28_8",

                "Encouraging the client to forget the crisis as quickly as possible",
                "Completing the gestalt by making meaning of the crisis and reorganizing the self-narrative",
                "Identifying which childhood trauma caused the crisis",
                "Ensuring the client remains dependent on the therapist for future stability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration involves 'completing the gestalt' of the crisis event, allowing the experience to move from 'figure' to 'ground' in a way that is meaningful and non-threatening."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client with C-PTSD begins to hyperventilate and lose eye contact during a session. Which Gestalt-based 'pendulation' intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client to dive deeper into the traumatic memory to 'get it all out'",
                "Gently directing the client's awareness away from the internal distress toward a neutral external sensation (e.g., the feel of the chair)",
                "Remaining silent to allow the client to process the experience alone",
                "Immediately ending the session to prevent further distress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation involves moving between the 'hot' traumatic material and 'cool' resources or neutral sensations in the current field to regulate the nervous system."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In the context of complex cases, 'Contact Turbulence' (Lesson 4) refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The smooth flow of energy between therapist and client",
                "The erratic and intense shifts in the contact boundary often seen in personality adaptations",
                "A technical failure where the therapist loses interest in the client",
                "The physical movement of the client during a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Contact Turbulence describes the volatile, rapidly changing nature of the boundary between self and other, common in clients with borderline or high-conflict dynamics."
