            "options": [
                "A biological malfunction of the prefrontal cortex.",
                "A lack of cognitive understanding regarding the traumatic event.",
                "A disruption in the person-environment field where past trauma intrudes upon present awareness, preventing fluid contact.",
                "The intentional suppression of memories to protect the ego."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt terms, trauma is viewed as a 'fragmented field' where the past remains an active, intrusive figure that prevents the individual from engaging in fluid, healthy contact with the present environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relational Gestalt focuses on the 'Between,' emphasizing the phenomenological field created by the couple's interaction rather than focusing solely on individual intrapsychic histories."

                "The therapist remains silent and lets the group lead.",
                "The therapist focuses exclusively on one member at a time while others watch.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike the 'Hot Seat' model (individual work within a group), the Interactive Model treats the group as a whole, focusing on the contact and awareness emerging between all members."

                "As a purely genetic predisposition toward substance use."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapy views addiction as a 'Chronic Fixed Gestalt'—a creative adjustment that has become rigid and repetitive, blocking the individual's ability to respond to new environmental data."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Empty Chair is used to bring 'Unfinished Business' into the here-and-now, allowing the client to express unvoiced emotions and find a sense of completion or 'closure' in the contact."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt OD, the practitioner uses their own 'presence' and awareness of the field's dynamics as a diagnostic and intervention tool to help the organization see itself more clearly."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Retroflection involves doing to oneself what one wants to do to others or having others do to them. Physically, this manifests as tension or 'holding' as the energy is turned back on the self."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client dissociates (leaves the window of tolerance), the Gestalt therapist provides 'Support' by grounding them in the current physical environment to re-establish a sense of safety and presence."
