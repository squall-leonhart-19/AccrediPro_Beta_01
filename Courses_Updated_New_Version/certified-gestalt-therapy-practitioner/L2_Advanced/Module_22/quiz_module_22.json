            "question": "In the context of the 'Ethics of Presence,' why is witnessing prioritized over interpretation in Gestalt therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Interpretation is considered a form of professional laziness.",
                "Witnessing honors the client's phenomenological authority and prevents the therapist from imposing their own 'truth'.",
                "Witnessing is faster and allows for more clients to be seen per day.",
                "Interpretation is only allowed in the final stage of the WHOLE model."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt ethics emphasize the client's own experience (phenomenology). Interpretation can bypass the client's awareness and impose the practitioner's biases."

            "options": [
                "By immediately terminating the session to maintain professional distance.",
                "By ignoring the feeling to avoid making the client uncomfortable.",
                "By utilizing self-disclosure to clarify where the practitioner's experience ends and the client's begins.",
                "By charging a higher fee for the increased emotional labor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical boundary management in Gestalt involves differentiating the self from the other within the field to prevent the loss of therapeutic objectivity."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "Regarding creative experimentation, 'process-oriented informed consent' means that:",
            "options": [
                "Consent is a one-time signature at the beginning of the first session.",
                "The practitioner can perform any experiment as long as the client is over 18.",
                "Consent is an ongoing dialogue, and the client is explicitly told they can stop or modify an experiment at any time.",
                "The practitioner must explain the exact psychological outcome of the experiment before it begins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because Gestalt experiments are emergent and unpredictable, ethics require 'ongoing' consent where the client retains agency throughout the process."

            "options": [
                "Cultural Humility is a lifelong process of self-critique rather than a 'mastery' of specific cultural facts.",
                "Cultural Competence is only for licensed psychologists, while humility is for practitioners.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in the WHOLE model.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility acknowledges that one can never be fully 'competent' in another's culture and requires an ongoing commitment to learning and self-reflection."

            "id": "q22_5",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Duty to Protect' is a legal and ethical mandate that supersedes confidentiality when there is a clear and foreseeable risk of harm to others."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Online Disinhibition Effect' can lead to 'premature vulnerability,' requiring the practitioner to work more slowly to ensure the client remains grounded."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 highlights that the 'limited frame' of a webcam often hides the client's lower body, which provides essential data about their level of support and grounding."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
