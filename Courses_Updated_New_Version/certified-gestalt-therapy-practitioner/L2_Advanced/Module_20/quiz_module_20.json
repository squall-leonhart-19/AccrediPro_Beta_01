            "question": "In the W.H.O.L.E. Framework™ used during phenomenological intake, what does the 'H' represent?",
            "options": ["Historical Context", "Here-and-now Presence", "Holistic Integration", "Habitual Patterns"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'H' in the W.H.O.L.E. Framework™ stands for Here-and-now Presence, emphasizing the client's immediate experience and the therapist's observations in the present moment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "The Gestalt Contact Styles Scale (GCSS-R) is primarily designed to measure which of the following?",
            "options": ["The severity of DSM-5 clinical symptoms", "The client's level of cognitive intelligence", "The frequency and intensity of contact interruptions (resistances)", "The client's childhood attachment style only"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The GCSS-R is a validated tool used to assess the five primary contact styles or 'resistances': Introjection, Projection, Retroflection, Deflection, and Confluence."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When performing 'Field Mapping' (L3), what is the practitioner assessing when they look at 'intersubjective forces'?",
            "options": ["The client's internal biological markers", "The dynamic space and influence between the client and others, including the therapist", "The client's past trauma history in isolation", "The physical layout of the client's home"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Field Mapping focuses on the relational environment, specifically the 'between'—the intersubjective space where the client and their environment influence one another."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "A client consistently clenches their jaw and restricts their breathing when discussing a specific colleague. From a Somatic Assessment perspective (L4), this is viewed as:",
            "options": ["A physiological defect requiring medical referral", "A random motor tic with no clinical significance", "A chronic retroflection or 'frozen history' in the body", "A sign of neurological fatigue"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt somatic assessment, physical tension is viewed as a 'fixed gestalt' or retroflection—where energy intended for the environment is turned back against the self."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which of the following best defines a 'Fixed Gestalt' in the context of clinical assessment?",
            "options": ["A healthy, flexible response to new stimuli", "An obsolete creative adjustment that is applied rigidly regardless of the current field", "The final stage of the contact-withdrawal cycle", "A diagnostic category in the DSM-5"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Fixed Gestalt is a pattern of behavior that was once a necessary creative adjustment to a past situation but has become rigid and is now applied inappropriately to the present."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During the Contact-Withdrawal Cycle Assessment (L6), an interruption occurring at the 'Mobilization' phase most often manifests as:",
            "options": ["Confluence and loss of self-boundary", "Retroflection and somatic tension/anxiety", "Post-contact satisfaction", "Sensation awareness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When energy is mobilized but cannot be moved into action, it is often retroflected, leading to anxiety, shallow breathing, or physical tension."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is a primary differentiator of Gestalt Outcome Measurement compared to traditional clinical tracking?",
            "options": ["It only tracks the reduction of symptoms", "It focuses on the 'vitality' of contact and the flexibility of the boundary", "It relies exclusively on the therapist's subjective opinion", "It ignores the client's self-report"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt outcome measurement prioritizes 'process' variables like increased awareness, contact vitality, and the client's ability to move fluidly through the contact cycle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "When integrating Gestalt assessment with DSM-5 diagnosis (L8), the ethical practitioner should view the DSM diagnosis as:",
            "options": ["The absolute truth about the client's identity", "Irrelevant to the therapeutic process", "A provisional, shorthand description of a field-dynamic, not a fixed trait", "A tool to be hidden from the client at all costs"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical Gestalt practice treats DSM diagnoses as provisional 'labels' for patterns of creative adjustment within a specific field, rather than fixed, internal pathologies."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client scores high on 'Deflection' on the GCSS-R. In session, you observe them using humor to avoid emotional depth. This is an example of:",
            "options": ["Successful contact", "A somatic fixed gestalt", "A contact interruption used to reduce the 'heat' of direct experience", "Introjection of the therapist's values"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Deflection is a contact style used to steer away from direct impact or emotional intensity, often through humor, generalization, or changing the subject."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Unfinished Business' is assessed by looking for which phenomenological sign?",
            "options": ["The client's ability to stay fully in the present without distraction", "A 'cloying' or repetitive quality in the client's narrative that prevents new figures from emerging", "Complete amnesia regarding childhood events", "The client's preference for future-oriented planning"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unfinished Business (the Zeigarnik effect in Gestalt) is identified by the persistence of past 'figures' that have not been fully energized or closed, often appearing as repetitive or stuck themes in the present."
