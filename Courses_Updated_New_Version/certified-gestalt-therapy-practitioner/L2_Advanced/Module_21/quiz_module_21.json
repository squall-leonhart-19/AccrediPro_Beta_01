            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Gestalt Treatment Planning' (L1), how does the Gestalt approach primarily differ from the traditional medical model of treatment planning?",
            "options": [
                "It follows a linear path from diagnosis to cure.",
                "It is emergent and process-oriented, focusing on the 'how' of contact rather than just the 'why' of symptoms.",
                "It prioritizes the elimination of symptoms before addressing the therapeutic relationship.",
                "It relies exclusively on standardized protocols regardless of the client's field."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt treatment planning is non-linear and emergent. It focuses on the phenomenological process and the quality of contact in the present moment, rather than a prescriptive path toward symptom suppression."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "During 'Phase I: Field Assessment and Witnessing the Now' (L2), what is the therapist's primary task regarding the 'Ground'?",
            "options": [
                "To ignore the background and focus only on the most dramatic emotions.",
                "To challenge the client's history immediately.",
                "To assess the client's support system, physiological state, and environmental context that supports the current Figure.",
                "To provide a list of coping mechanisms for the client to use at home."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase I involves assessing the 'Ground'—the underlying supports (biological, social, environmental) that allow a specific 'Figure' (the presenting issue) to emerge."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes a 'Phenomenological Diagnosis' as discussed in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "A static label derived from the DSM-5-TR.",
                "A dynamic description of how the client organizes their experience at the contact boundary.",
                "A prediction of the client's future behavior based on past trauma.",
                "A classification of the client's personality type into one of four quadrants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A phenomenological diagnosis is an ongoing, aesthetic, and functional description of the client's process of self-righting and contact at the boundary between self and environment."

        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "In 'Phase II: Heightening Awareness' (L4), what is the purpose of 'Sequencing Interventions'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client reaches a catharsis in every single session.",
                "To move systematically from surface-level awareness to deeper contact, respecting the client's current level of support.",
                "To prevent the therapist from becoming bored during the session.",
                "To follow a strict 10-step protocol required for insurance reimbursement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sequencing ensures that interventions are graded. The therapist moves from simple awareness to more complex experiments only when the client has sufficient internal and external support."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",

            "options": [
                "A healthy habit that provides stability in the client's life.",
                "A creative adjustment that has become an automatic, out-of-date response regardless of current environmental changes.",
                "The client's refusal to attend therapy sessions on time.",
                "A biological reflex that cannot be changed through talk therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Fixed Gestalt is a 'stuck' creative adjustment—a behavior that was once useful for survival but is now applied indiscriminately, even when it no longer serves the client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In Relational Field Planning (L6), the 'Intervention' is seen as occurring where?",
            "options": [
                "Inside the client's subconscious mind.",
                "In the therapist's diagnostic manual.",
                "In the 'Between'—the co-created space and interaction between therapist and client.",
                "Solely in the client's homework assignments between sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Relational Field Planning recognizes that therapy is a co-created process. Change happens through the real, authentic contact and dynamics occurring between the practitioner and the client."

                "Ending the session exactly on the 50-minute mark."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase IV is about 'Closing the Gestalt' and integration—taking the new awareness or behavior and weaving it into the client's sense of self so it can be used outside the therapy room."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Ethical Documentation.' How should a Gestalt therapist document an 'Experiment'?",
            "options": [
                "Omit experiments from notes to protect client privacy.",
                "Document the rationale, the client's informed consent, the process of the experiment, and the phenomenological outcome.",
                "Only record the experiment if it was successful in reducing symptoms.",
                "Use vague language like 'did some chair work' to avoid legal scrutiny."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical documentation requires a clear record of the clinical rationale for the experiment, the client's voluntary participation, and what actually occurred during the process."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'Retroflection' (holding back emotions). According to Phase III (L5), which experiment would be most appropriate for 'liberating' this fixed gestalt?",
            "options": [
                "A relaxation exercise to further suppress the emotion.",
                "An expressive experiment, such as using a pillow to externalize the physical tension they are holding.",
                "A lecture on why retroflection is a 'bad' defense mechanism.",
                "Asking the client to talk about their childhood for the entire session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For retroflection, the goal is to turn the energy outward. Expressive experiments help the client move the energy from the self back toward the environment/other."

        {
            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Outcome Measurement.' Which approach is most consistent with Gestalt values?",
            "options": [
                "Using only standardized depression scales (like the PHQ-9).",
                "Measuring 'Contact Clarity' and the client's increased capacity for self-regulation and environmental awareness.",
                "Ignoring outcomes and focusing only on the therapist's intuition.",
                "Comparing the client's progress to a 'normal' person's behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standardized tools can be used, Gestalt-consistent outcome measurement looks at functional shifts in how the client contacts their world and their increased flexibility in creative adjustment."
