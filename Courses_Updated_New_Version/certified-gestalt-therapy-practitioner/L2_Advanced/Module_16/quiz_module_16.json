            "question": "In the W.H.O.L.E. Framework used for complex trauma (L1), what does the 'H' specifically refer to in the therapeutic process?",
            "options": [
                "Healing the inner child",
                "Honoring the survival adaptation",
                "Holistic somatic integration",
                "History taking and assessment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'H' in the W.H.O.L.E. framework stands for 'Honoring the survival adaptation,' recognizing that the client's current 'dysfunctional' behaviors were once creative adjustments necessary for survival."

            "question": "When working with a 'Relational Impasse' in Borderline Adaptations (L2), what is the primary goal of the Gestalt therapist?",
            "options": [
                "To provide the 'missing' parenting the client never received",
                "To set rigid boundaries that the client cannot cross",
                "To stay present and 'contactful' at the boundary where the client oscillates between need and fear",
                "To interpret the client's split-off ego states to provide cognitive insight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Gestalt therapy, the focus is on the contact boundary. For borderline adaptations, the therapist aims to remain present during the oscillation between the fear of abandonment and the fear of engulfment."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to Somatic Gestalt principles (L3), a psychosomatic manifestation like chronic shoulder tension is most accurately viewed as:",
            "options": [
                "A sign of physical aging or poor posture",
                "A retroflected impulse, such as an inhibited urge to strike out or hold back",
                "A conversion disorder requiring psychiatric medication",
                "An introjection of a parent's physical stance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Gestalt views physical symptoms as retroflections—impulses or actions the person originally intended for the environment but turned back upon themselves."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In the context of Complicated Grief (L4), 'Unfinished Business' is often maintained through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Internalized Other,' where the lost person is held as a fixed introject",
                "A lack of cognitive acceptance of the death",
                "The refusal to attend a funeral or ritual",
                "A biological deficiency in serotonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Complicated grief often involves an 'Internalized Other' or introject. The work involves externalizing this introject (e.g., empty chair) to complete the unfinished dialogue."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Narcissistic Wound' is described as being fundamentally rooted in 'Toxic Shame.' How does the 'False Self' function in this dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "It is a conscious attempt to lie to others",
                "It is a creative adjustment designed to garner the support/admiration the 'True Self' feels it doesn't deserve",
                "It is a biological byproduct of high testosterone",
                "It is a sign that the client has no capacity for empathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The False Self is a creative adjustment to a field that did not provide enough support, creating a persona to gain external validation to mask deep-seated toxic shame."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "From a Gestalt perspective on Addictive Patterns (L6), the substance or compulsive behavior is often used to:",
            "options": [
                "Increase the client's contact with reality",
                "Artificially close a 'Gestalt' that the client lacks the environmental support to close naturally",
                "Punish the self for past mistakes",
                "Demonstrate a lack of willpower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addiction is seen as a way to manage the field. The substance 'closes' the gestalt (provides temporary relief or numbing) when the client cannot find a healthy way to meet their needs."

            "id": "q16_7",

                "The individual pathologies each partner brought from childhood",

                "Teaching the partners better communication skills like 'I' statements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt couples therapy focuses on the 'between'—the co-created field. The therapist observes how the couple makes (or avoids) contact with each other in the here-and-now."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When a client experiences an Existential Crisis (L8), the Gestalt therapist encourages them to stay with the 'Fertile Void.' This refers to:",
            "options": [
                "A state of total nihilism and hopelessness",
                "The uncomfortable space of 'not knowing' where new meaning can eventually emerge",
                "A meditation technique used to clear the mind of all thoughts",
                "The period of time between therapy sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'fertile void' is a central Gestalt concept where the client stops 'doing' and 'striving' and simply stays with the emptiness, allowing a new 'figure' or meaning to emerge naturally."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Fixed Gestalt' regarding their career, repeatedly choosing high-stress jobs and burning out. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "An organismic self-regulation failure",
                "A healthy adjustment to a capitalist society",
                "A lack of professional training",
                "A creative adjustment that has become rigid and no longer serves the current field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A 'Fixed Gestalt' is a creative adjustment that was once useful but has become a rigid habit that the client applies to all situations, regardless of the current environmental reality."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "During a somatic session (L3), a therapist notices the client's breath becomes shallow when discussing a specific topic. The most 'Gestalt' intervention would be:",
            "options": [
                "To tell the client they are anxious and need to calm down",
                "To ignore the breath and focus on the narrative content",
                "To ask the client to 'become' the shallow breath and give it a voice",
                "To immediately teach the client 4-7-8 breathing techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapy emphasizes awareness and identification. Asking the client to 'be' the symptom (prosopopeia) helps them move from 'it' to 'I' and gain insight into the function of the somatic adjustment."
