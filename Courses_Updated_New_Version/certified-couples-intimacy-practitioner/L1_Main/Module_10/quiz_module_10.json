            "options": [
                "To identify and visualize specific psychological and physical blockages to intimacy",
                "To create a schedule for sexual encounters",
                "To resolve all childhood trauma before proceeding to physical touch",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Connection Mapping is the diagnostic phase where practitioners help couples identify and visualize the specific blockages—whether historical, situational, or somatic—that prevent intimacy."

                "To ensure both partners use the exact same vocabulary at all times",
                "To discourage verbal communication in favor of somatic touch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Language Alignment focuses on 'Intimacy Translation,' moving from ambiguous statements (e.g., 'I want to feel closer') to actionable requests (e.g., 'I would like 10 minutes of focused conversation after dinner')."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "It allows partners to ignore physical pain during intimacy",

                "It is a technique used solely for improving athletic performance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive awareness is the ability to sense internal bodily states. In intimacy, this allows individuals to catch 'somatic markers' of stress or shutdown early, preventing the 'freeze' response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Since the blockages are situational (lifestyle/stress), the C.L.O.S.E.R. method suggests structural changes like Ritualized Re-entry to create a 'sacred space' for the partnership amidst daily demands."

            "options": [
                "It narrows to prevent over-stimulation",
                "It expands, allowing the couple to navigate higher levels of stress without moving into hyper-arousal (fight/flight)",
                "It disappears as the couple reaches a state of pure bliss",
                "It becomes irrelevant once the C.L.O.S.E.R. method is mastered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation expands the Window of Tolerance, meaning the couple can handle more 'relational heat' or stress while staying connected and grounded."
