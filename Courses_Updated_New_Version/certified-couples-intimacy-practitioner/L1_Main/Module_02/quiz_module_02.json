            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A true NVC request is specific, actionable, and phrased as a 'would you be willing' rather than a demand or a vague desire."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Responsive desire means that the 'engine' starts after the 'key' is turned; arousal often occurs first in response to stimulation or connection, which then triggers the feeling of desire."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
