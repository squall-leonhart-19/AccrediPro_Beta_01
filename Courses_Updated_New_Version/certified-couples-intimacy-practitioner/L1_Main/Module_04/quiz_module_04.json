            "question": "Which specific neural pathway is primarily responsible for processing the affective, emotional quality of slow, social touch rather than just the physical pressure?",
            "options": [
                "A-beta fibers",
                "C-tactile (CT) afferents",
                "Proprioceptive spindles",
                "Nociceptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "C-tactile (CT) afferents are specialized unmyelinated nerve fibers in the skin that respond specifically to slow, gentle stroking and are directly linked to the brain's emotional processing centers, facilitating social bonding."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the context of Interoception (Lesson 1), why is 'Interoceptive Awareness' considered the foundation of somatic intimacy?",
            "options": [
                "It allows a partner to predict the other's thoughts without communication.",
                "It increases the speed of reflex actions during physical activity.",
                "It enables individuals to sense their internal physiological state, which is necessary for authentic emotional expression.",
                "It focuses exclusively on external sensory stimuli like sight and sound."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Without it, individuals cannot accurately identify their own needs or boundaries, making authentic somatic connection with a partner difficult."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to the FRIES model of consent discussed in Lesson 3, what must be true for consent to be considered 'Informed'?",
            "options": [
                "The partner has agreed to similar activities in the past.",
                "The partner knows exactly what the activity entails and any potential risks or boundaries.",
                "The partner says 'yes' even if they seem hesitant or distracted.",
                "The partner is under the influence of substances but appears enthusiastic."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires that all parties have a full understanding of the activity, ensuring there are no 'surprises' that could trigger a trauma response or boundary violation."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "When a practitioner observes 'Physiological Linkage' between a couple (Lesson 5), what is actually occurring?",
            "options": [
                "The couple is arguing using the same vocabulary.",
                "The couple's heart rates and respiratory patterns are synchronizing through co-regulation.",
                "One partner is dominating the other's physical space.",
                "The couple is performing a choreographed dance routine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological linkage refers to the spontaneous synchronization of autonomic nervous system states between partners, often facilitated by shared breath or proximity, indicating high levels of somatic attunement."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A client feels 'frozen' when their partner initiates touch, despite wanting to be close. Which somatic state are they likely experiencing according to Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown/Freeze)",
                "Hyper-arousal (Manic)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'freeze' or 'shutdown' response is a Dorsal Vagal state. In a somatic sanctuary, the goal is to move the client back into a Ventral Vagal state where they feel safe enough to engage."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "What is the primary rule of 'Non-Demand Touch' rituals like Sensate Focus (Lesson 6)?",
            "options": [
                "Touch must lead to sexual intercourse within 20 minutes.",
                "The goal is to provide pleasure to the partner only.",
                "Sexual arousal and intercourse are 'off the table' to remove performance pressure.",
                "Partners must remain silent throughout the entire ritual."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-demand touch is designed to remove the 'end-goal' of sex, allowing partners to focus purely on the sensations of touch and reducing the anxiety associated with performance or expectation."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Micro-expressions' are defined as brief, involuntary facial expressions. Which of these is a 'somatic red flag' during a touch exercise?",
            "options": [
                "A brief flash of a 'nose wrinkle' (disgust) followed by a forced smile.",
                "Sustained eye contact with relaxed pupils.",
                "Deep, rhythmic breathing.",
                "Leaning the torso slightly toward the partner."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A micro-expression of disgust or pain followed by a forced smile indicates a lack of somatic congruence—the partner is verbally or socially complying while their body is signaling a 'no'."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Research suggests that a 20-second hug can trigger the release of Oxytocin. What is the primary benefit of this hormonal release in a partnership?",
            "options": [
                "It increases physical strength and speed.",
                "It lowers cortisol levels and increases feelings of trust and safety.",
                "It improves short-term memory and cognitive function.",
                "It acts as a stimulant, increasing heart rate and alertness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, often called the 'bonding hormone,' counteracts the stress hormone cortisol, facilitating a sense of safety and emotional closeness between partners."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "When 'Relational Weaving' (Lesson 8), why is 'Habit Stacking' recommended for somatic integration?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the exercises more difficult and rewarding.",
                "It replaces old memories with new ones.",
                "It attaches a new somatic habit to an existing, automatic behavior, increasing consistency.",
                "It allows the couple to perform five different exercises at once."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking (e.g., 'When we first sit on the couch after work, we will hold hands for 1 minute') uses the brain's existing neural pathways to make new somatic behaviors automatic."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which grounding technique is most effective for a partner who is becoming 'flooded' (overwhelmed) during a difficult conversation?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging them to think about their childhood.",
                "The 5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness technique to return to the present moment.",
                "Asking them to explain exactly why they are feeling overwhelmed.",
                "Telling them to 'calm down' and keep talking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory grounding (5-4-3-2-1) pulls the individual out of a cognitive 'loop' or emotional flood and back into their immediate physical environment, regulating the nervous system."
