            "question": "In the 'Foundations of Connection Mapping,' what is the primary objective of assessing the 'Relational Baseline' during the initial practitioner phase?",
            "options": [
                "To identify which partner is responsible for the breakdown in communication",
                "To map the current frequency of sexual encounters versus desired frequency",
                "To identify existing strengths and specific deficits within the 'C' (Connection) Pillar",
                "To provide a clinical diagnosis for individual psychological disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Connection Mapping is designed to objectively assess the current state of the relational field, highlighting where the 'C' Pillar is strong and where it requires intervention."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the neurobiological research presented in L2, which neuropeptide is most closely associated with long-term pair-bonding, territorial stability, and 'protective' behaviors in intimate relationships?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine",
                "Vasopressin",

                "Adrenaline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Oxytocin is often called the 'cuddle hormone,' Vasopressin plays a critical role in long-term pair-bonding and the motivation to maintain and protect the relationship."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A couple is in a state of 'Ventral Vagal' activation according to Polyvagal Theory. How is this state most likely to manifest in their interaction?",
            "options": [
                "A 'fight or flight' response characterized by shouting and elevated heart rates",
                "A 'freeze' response where both partners become silent and emotionally numb",
                "A state of social engagement, felt safety, and the ability to process complex emotions",
                "A state of hyper-vigilance where they are scanning for threats in the partner's tone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'social engagement system' where the parasympathetic nervous system allows for connection, safety, and intimacy."

            "question": "In Lesson 3: Language Alignment, a practitioner helps a client translate the demand 'You never prioritize our time together' into a needs-based 'I' statement. Which of the following is the most effective alignment?",
            "options": [
                "I feel like you don't care about me because we never hang out.",
                "I need you to stop working late so we can have a real relationship.",
                "I value our connection deeply, and I feel lonely when we don't have dedicated time together; would you be open to a weekly date night?",
                "You are always busy, and I need that to change immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective language alignment focuses on the speaker's feelings and values, followed by a specific, actionable request rather than a criticism or demand."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Based on the 'Architecture of Trust' (L4), research by the Gottman Institute suggests that trust is built in 'small moments.' What is the technical term for an attempt by one partner to get attention, affirmation, or affection?",

                "A Bid for Connection",
                "An Emotional Hook",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A 'Bid for Connection' is the fundamental unit of emotional communication; how a partner responds to these bids (turning toward vs. turning away) builds or erodes trust over time."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Somatic Integration (L5) emphasizes the importance of 'C-tactile fibers.' What specific type of touch is required to optimally activate these fibers to promote emotional bonding?",
            "options": [
                "Deep tissue pressure similar to a sports massage",
                "Rapid, rhythmic tapping on the shoulders",

                "Intermittent, high-intensity contact"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "C-tactile fibers are neurobiological pathways specifically tuned to slow, gentle, affective touch, which triggers oxytocin release and reduces cortisol."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "During a conflict, a partner's heart rate exceeds 100 BPM. According to Lesson 6 on Co-regulation, what is the most appropriate practitioner recommendation at this moment?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage them to push through the discomfort to reach a resolution",

                "Increase the intensity of the session to uncover the root trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When heart rates exceed 100 BPM, 'flooding' occurs, and the prefrontal cortex goes offline. A 20-minute break is biologically necessary for the nervous system to return to the Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In 'Relational Mastery' (L7), the 5:1 ratio is cited as a hallmark of stable, happy relationships. What does this ratio represent?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that stable relationships maintain a ratio of at least 5 positive interactions to 1 negative interaction, even during arguments."

            "question": "Case Study Application: Mark and Elena have lost their 'spark' and feel like roommates. Which L1 intervention would be most effective for re-establishing the neurobiological 'glue' of their bond?",
            "options": [
                "A 10-minute daily logic-based debrief about household chores",

                "Separating their living spaces to create 'mystery' and 'longing'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 20-second hug is a somatic intervention that leverages neurobiology to move a couple from a state of 'roommate syndrome' back into physiological connection."

            "id": "q14_10",

                "To immediately introduce advanced sexual techniques to bypass emotional blocks",
                "To recommend a trial separation until the 'heat' of the conflict subsides naturally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In L1 integration, the priority is physiological and emotional stabilization; deeper vulnerability and complex intimacy work cannot happen if the couple is constantly outside their Window of Tolerance."
