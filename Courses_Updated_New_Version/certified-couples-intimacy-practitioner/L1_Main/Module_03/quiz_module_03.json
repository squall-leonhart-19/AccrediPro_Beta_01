            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The amygdala acts as the brain's alarm system; when vulnerability is perceived as a social threat, it triggers a fight-flight-freeze response, often bypassing the logical prefrontal cortex."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirroring or repeating back ensures the speaker feels heard and validated, which lowers cortisol levels and prevents the listener from making assumptions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in the lesson on the Shadow, shame is an ontological indictment of the self ('I am bad'), whereas guilt is a reflection on a specific action ('I did something bad')."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proactive disclosure is essential for trust repair because it demonstrates that the partner is no longer hiding information, shifting the burden of 'discovery' off the betrayed partner."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Empathic Witness provides a 'holding environment' where the partner can reveal their 'Shadow' without fear of rejection, which is the key to integrating shame."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Daily rituals of vulnerability help regulate the nervous system (increasing Vagal Tone) and build a 'reservoir' of goodwill that protects the relationship during high-stress periods."
