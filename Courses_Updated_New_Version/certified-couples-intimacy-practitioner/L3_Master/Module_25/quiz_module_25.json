                "To ensure the practitioner is meeting weekly billing quotas",
                "To facilitate the practitioner's self-awareness and cognitive processing of their own clinical reactions",
                "To provide a script for the practitioner to read to the couple",
                "To document the legal liability of the supervisor only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Reflective Loop is a core component of advanced supervision that moves beyond administrative oversight to help practitioners understand their internal processes and how they impact the therapeutic alliance."

                "The practitioner projected their own gender biases onto the couple's non-verbal communication",
                "The practitioner used a digital intake form instead of paper",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In advanced case analysis, supervisors look for 'interpretive bias' where the practitioner misreads client cues based on their own internal filters rather than objective observation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel Process is a central concept in supervision where the 'vibe' or conflict occurring in the practitioner-client relationship manifests within the supervision session itself."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing triggers involves identifying the source (often personal history) and using supervision to prevent that trigger from interfering with the client's progress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious learning in groups is highly efficient because practitioners often recognize their own mistakes or strengths when they see them reflected in a colleague's case presentation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Competency in intimacy work is heavily weighted toward the ability to form and maintain a therapeutic alliance, making client-reported alliance scores a gold-standard metric."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical mentorship requires the leader to empower the mentee's autonomy rather than creating a cult of personality or 'guru' dynamic that discourages questioning."

                "The practitioner's own discomfort with high-intensity emotional affect or 'holding the space'",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervisors watch for 'premature rescue' because it prevents couples from experiencing the necessary emotional tension required for a breakthrough in intimacy."
