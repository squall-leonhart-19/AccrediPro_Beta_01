            "question": "In the context of Infidelity Recovery (L1), what is the primary objective of 'Connection Mapping'?",
            "options": [
                "To determine the exact timeline of the physical betrayal",
                "To identify the systemic vulnerabilities and 'attachment gaps' that existed prior to the infidelity",
                "To assign a percentage of blame to each partner for the breakdown of the marriage",
                "To create a legal record of the affair for use in potential divorce proceedings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Connection Mapping is a systemic tool used to look beyond the event of the affair to understand the underlying relational architecture and attachment deficits that made the relationship vulnerable, without excusing the betrayal."

            "question": "A couple in post-addiction recovery (L2) is experiencing 'Emotional Anesthesia.' Which mechanism best explains this phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "The brain's reward system (dopamine) is still recalibrating, leading to a temporary inability to feel high-intensity pleasure or intimacy",
                "The sober partner is intentionally withholding affection as a form of punishment",
                "The addicted partner has lost all interest in intimacy permanently due to the substance use",
                "It is a sign that the couple is no longer compatible and should seek discernment counseling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In early recovery, the neurobiology of pleasure is often dampened (anhedonia) as the brain recalibrates from high-intensity substance-induced dopamine spikes, making 'normal' intimacy feel muted."

            "question": "During High-Conflict De-escalation (L3), what is the 'Vagal Brake' and how does it apply to co-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "A cognitive technique used to stop a partner from speaking during an argument",
                "A physical device used to monitor heart rate variability in session",
                "The physiological mechanism that allows the parasympathetic nervous system to slow down heart rate and promote a state of safety",
                "The point at which a practitioner must terminate a session due to safety concerns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagal Brake refers to the influence of the vagus nerve on the heart; in high-conflict scenarios, practitioners help couples 're-engage' the brake to transition from a fight-flight state back to a social engagement state."

                "Improve their nutritional intake to manage symptoms",
                "Quantify and communicate limited energy reserves for daily tasks and intimacy",

                "Determine who should be responsible for household chores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spoon Theory is a metaphor used in the chronic illness community to describe the finite amount of energy (spoons) available; it helps partners understand that intimacy requires 'spoons' that may have been depleted by basic survival tasks."

            "question": "In Neurodivergent (ND) couples (L5), the 'Double Empathy Problem' suggests that:",
            "options": [
                "ND individuals completely lack empathy for their neurotypical partners",
                "Neurotypical partners have twice as much empathy as ND partners",
                "Communication breakdowns occur because both parties struggle to empathize with a person whose neurological 'operating system' differs from their own",
                "ND couples are actually more empathetic than neurotypical couples"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties are a 'two-way street' resulting from a mismatch in communication styles and lived experiences between ND and neurotypical individuals, rather than a deficit in one person."

            "question": "For clients with CPTSD (L6), why is 'Titration' critical in trauma-informed somatic work?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures the practitioner is paid in small increments",
                "It involves processing trauma in small, manageable 'drops' to prevent flooding and re-traumatization",
                "It is a method of increasing the intensity of the trauma narrative to force a breakthrough",
                "It refers to the use of medication to balance neurochemistry before therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the somatic practice of slowing down the processing of traumatic energy so the nervous system can integrate small amounts of sensation without being overwhelmed or triggered into a dissociative state."

            "id": "q28_7",

                "Prove to the 'leaning out' partner that they are making a mistake",
                "Provide a quick 'no-fault' exit strategy for the couple"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Discernment Counseling is a short-term (1-5 sessions) process designed to gain clarity and confidence in a direction for the relationship, specifically when one partner is 'leaning out' and the other is 'leaning in.'"

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "According to the Case Integration strategy (L8), what is the 'Hierarchy of Intervention' when managing multi-layered cases?",
            "options": [
                "Sexual satisfaction > Emotional connection > Physical safety",
                "Physical safety/Stabilization > Attachment repair > Sexual integration",

                "Neurodivergent education > Addiction recovery > Infidelity mapping"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, the practitioner must prioritize safety and stabilization (e.g., active addiction or high conflict) before attempting deep attachment repair or advanced sexual somatic work."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Which somatic sign indicates that a high-conflict couple has moved out of their 'Window of Tolerance' during a session?",
            "options": [
                "Softening of the facial muscles and deeper breathing",
                "Increased eye contact and leaning toward the partner",
                "Dilated pupils, rapid/shallow breathing, or sudden emotional shutdown (dissociation)",
                "Using 'I' statements and reflecting the partner's words"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Physiological markers like pupil dilation, tachypnea (rapid breathing), or 'stonewalling' (shutdown) are indicators of hyper-arousal or hypo-arousal, signaling the couple has left the Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In a case involving both Neurodivergence and Sexual Trauma (L5 & L6), why might 'Sensory Overload' be mistaken for a 'Trauma Trigger'?",
            "options": [
                "They are exactly the same biological process",
                "Both can result in a 'shutdown' or 'meltdown' response, though the root cause (sensory processing vs. fear memory) differs",
                "Neurodivergent people cannot have sexual trauma",
                "Trauma triggers only happen in neurotypical individuals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must distinguish between sensory-based overwhelm (ND) and trauma-based triggers (PTSD) because the intervention differs: one requires environmental/sensory adjustment, while the other requires somatic trauma integration."
