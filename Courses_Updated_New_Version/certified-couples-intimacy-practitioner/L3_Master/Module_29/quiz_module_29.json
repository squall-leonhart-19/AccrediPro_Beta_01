            "question": "In the transition from 'Fixer' to 'Facilitator' (L1), what is the primary shift in the practitioner's objective when a couple presents with a recurring conflict?",
            "options": [
                "To provide the definitive solution to the specific argument presented.",
                "To remain neutral and let the couple argue until they reach exhaustion.",
                "To create a container where the couple's internal wisdom can emerge and drive the resolution.",
                "To identify which partner is 'wrong' based on evidence-based communication models."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Master Practitioner moves away from 'fixing' external symptoms and instead facilitates a process where the couple discovers their own capacity for resolution and healing."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "When utilizing Advanced Connection Mapping (L2), what does a 'recursive feedback loop' typically indicate in a systemic blueprint?",
            "options": [
                "A one-time misunderstanding that is easily corrected with better vocabulary.",
                "A self-reinforcing cycle where Partner A's defense triggers Partner B's wound, which in turn reinforces Partner A's defense.",
                "The genetic predisposition toward avoidant attachment styles.",
                "A healthy sign of emotional resilience and cognitive flexibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recursive loops are systemic patterns where the reactions of one partner serve as the stimuli for the other, creating a cycle that maintains the status quo of the relationship."

        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "According to the principles of Nuanced Language Alignment (L3), which element of communication is most responsible for signaling safety to the partner's Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prosody is a primary neurobiological cue. A melodic, warm vocal tone signals safety to the nervous system, whereas monotonic or sharp tones can trigger defensive states regardless of the words used."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-resistance cases, the practitioner uses their own nervous system and presence (Self-as-Instrument) to model the vulnerability required, creating a 'safe-enough' environment for the couple to follow."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "During Somatic Synthesis (L5), if a client experiences 'Somatic Flooding' (sympathetic overdrive) during a touch exercise, what is the Master Practitioner's first priority?",

                "To push through the discomfort to achieve a 'cathartic release.'",
                "To immediately shift to a cognitive 'talk therapy' approach to ignore the body.",
                "To facilitate 'Pendulation'—moving the client's attention from the overwhelming sensation to a resource of safety in the body.",
                "To tell the partner to touch the client more firmly to ground them."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is a key somatic technique used to help clients manage intensity by oscillating between areas of tension and areas of resource/safety, preventing re-traumatization."

                "It is scripted by the practitioner to ensure no mistakes are made.",
                "It happens in the 'here-and-now,' focusing on the physiological shifts occurring between the couple in the moment.",
                "It is performed in front of a mirror to increase self-consciousness.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the past and how the couple used to interact."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level enactments are experiential and focus on the 'live' neurobiological exchange and somatic signals occurring between partners in the present moment."

                "The ritual must be performed in public to ensure accountability.",
                "The ritual must involve sensory-rich elements and a clear 'threshold' (start and end point).",
                "The ritual must be exactly the same for every couple the practitioner sees."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sacred rituals require sensory engagement and a defined 'sacred space' (the threshold) to distinguish the ritualistic action from everyday mundane interaction."

            "id": "q29_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the act of pulling disparate data points (attachment history, somatic patterns, systemic loops) into a unified understanding of the couple's relational 'dance.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RSA linkage is a physiological marker of co-regulation, showing that the partners' nervous systems are influencing and attuning to one another in real-time."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "Which 'Master Practitioner' intervention is most appropriate for a couple stuck in a 'Deadlock' where one partner is hyper-aroused and the other is hypo-aroused (shutdown)?",
