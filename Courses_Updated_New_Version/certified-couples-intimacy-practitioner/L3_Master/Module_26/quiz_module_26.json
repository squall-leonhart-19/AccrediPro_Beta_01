            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The ARE model is a cornerstone of Connection Mapping, assessing how partners turn toward, away from, or against emotional bids."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Non-demand touch (like Sensate Focus) is designed to lower the stakes, reducing the 'cortisol spike' often associated with touch in distressed couples."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Crisis & Conflict Design' lesson, what physiological indicator suggests a client has reached 'Flooding' and requires a 20-minute co-regulation break?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Physiological flooding, typically marked by a heart rate over 100 BPM, inhibits the prefrontal cortex, making productive intimacy work impossible until the nervous system settles."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A couple in your program experiences a 'rupture' during a somatic exercise. According to 'Crisis Design' protocols, what is your first step?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization must always precede exploration. If a rupture occurs, the practitioner must pause the protocol and employ co-regulation techniques."
