            "question": "In the context of Advanced Connection Mapping (L1), what does the 'Tertiary Attachment Loop' specifically identify within a couple's subconscious blockages?",
            "options": [
                "The immediate verbal triggers used during an active argument.",
                "The shadow projections stemming from unresolved parental or generational attachment wounds.",
                "The logistical breakdown in a couple's daily scheduling and chores.",
                "The physiological peak of a heart rate spike during conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level mapping looks beyond immediate triggers to the Tertiary Attachment Loop, which involves deep-seated shadow projections and generational wounds that dictate subconscious behavior."

            "question": "Linguistic Nuance (L2) strategies suggest that 'Reflective Reframing' is most effective when the practitioner does which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Repeats the client's words back to them exactly as they were said.",
                "Corrects the client's grammar to ensure professional communication.",
                "Identifies and names the underlying biological driver or unmet need hidden within the client's complaint.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflective Reframing at the Master level involves translating a client's surface-level complaint into the underlying biological or emotional driver, helping the partner hear the 'need' rather than the 'attack.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Containment Field is a master-level skill where the practitioner's own nervous system regulation provides a 'safety net' that allows high-conflict couples to access vulnerability without spiraling into a fight-or-flight response."

            "question": "In Somatic Integration (L4), Polyvagal Theory suggests that the 'Social Engagement System' is mediated by a complex of cranial nerves. Which nerves are included in this Master-level application?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced Polyvagal applications recognize that social engagement involves facial expression (VII), vocalization (IX, X), and head turning (XI), as well as middle ear muscles (V), all working in concert with the Vagus nerve."

                "The practitioner must feel the exact same pain as the client to be authentic.",

                "The practitioner should avoid all eye contact to remain neutral.",
                "The practitioner should use a loud voice to command authority over the couple."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Mirror' effect works because the practitioner remains regulated (Ventral Vagal), allowing the clients' nervous systems to 'entrain' or sync with the practitioner's calm state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners practice 'Fluid Rigidity'—they are unshakeable in their ethical standards (rigidity) but warm, adaptable, and present in their relational approach (fluidity)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that 'Physiological Pauses'—stopping the interaction when heart rates exceed 100 BPM—resulted in a 58% reduction in verbal aggression by preventing the Amygdala Hijack."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "During a session, a couple enters a 'Dorsal Vagal' state of shutdown and numbness (L4). Which Master-level somatic intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Forcing them to look each other in the eye and say 'I love you.'",
                "Introducing 'micro-movements' or gentle vocalizations to slowly bring the nervous system back toward a Ventral state.",
                "Ending the session immediately because they are not participating.",
                "Using high-conflict confrontation to 'wake them up' from the numbness."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a couple is in Dorsal Vagal shutdown (collapse), aggressive or high-intensity interventions will only deepen the shutdown. Micro-movements and gentle sensory input are required to safely transition them back to engagement."
