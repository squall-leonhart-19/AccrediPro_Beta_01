            "options": [
                "It allows the facilitator to work less by letting the group lead themselves.",
                "It creates a ripple effect where one couple's breakthrough lowers the 'vulnerability threshold' for others.",
                "It ensures that all couples reach the exact same emotional state at the same time.",
                "It prevents conflict by forcing everyone to conform to the group's positive mood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social contagion refers to the phenomenon where the emotional expression and vulnerability of one couple encourage others to follow suit, effectively lowering the collective barrier to intimacy."

            "options": [
                "It is skipped entirely to save time for the 'S' and 'E' phases.",
                "It focus exclusively on the facilitator's connection to each individual person.",
                "It shifts from dyadic calibration to 'Group Field' calibration to ensure collective safety.",
                "It requires a 60-minute silent meditation before any talking occurs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaling the C.L.O.S.E.R. Method™ requires the facilitator to calibrate the 'Group Field,' ensuring the entire room feels safe and connected before moving into deeper work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vulnerability Threshold is the point where participants feel exposed. Facilitators use incrementalism—starting with low-stakes sharing—to build the safety needed for deeper intimacy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Facilitators must 'contain' the rupture, ensuring the couple feels supported while showing the rest of the group how repair is possible in real-time."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Warm, dim lighting mimics the 'campfire effect,' which triggers the parasympathetic nervous system and encourages deeper self-disclosure and intimacy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Screen fatigue and cognitive load peak around the 90-minute mark. To maintain the 'S' (Somatic) and 'E' (Emotional) aspects of the C.L.O.S.E.R. Method™, breaks or sensory shifts are essential."
