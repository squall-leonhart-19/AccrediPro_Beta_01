            "options": [
                "It requires the practitioner to carry more insurance.",
                "It dilutes perceived authority and makes it harder to command premium package pricing.",
                "It is a violation of the AccrediPro ethical guidelines to be a generalist.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Generalist Trap prevents a practitioner from becoming a 'Category of One.' By specializing in a specific niche (e.g., post-partum intimacy), you increase your perceived value and authority."

            "explanation": "Scope of Practice Creep occurs when a coach or practitioner attempts to diagnose or treat clinical mental health disorders, which requires a licensed therapeutic credential."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evaluation ensures the couple sees tangible progress. Without formal milestones, clients often feel they aren't 'getting anywhere,' which leads to premature dropout."

                "20% of the call should be a free mini-session, and 80% should be onboarding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Discovery Call is an assessment of fit. By letting the client speak 80% of the time, the practitioner gathers the data necessary to determine if the C.L.O.S.E.R. Method™ is appropriate for them."
