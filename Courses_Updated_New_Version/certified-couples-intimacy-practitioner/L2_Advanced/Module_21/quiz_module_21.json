            "question": "In 'The Architecture of Advanced Intimacy Treatment,' what is the primary purpose of the 'Relational Scaffolding' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately resolve all sexual dysfunctions through physical intervention",
                "To build the necessary emotional safety and communication infrastructure before introducing high-vulnerability intimacy tasks",
                "To identify which partner is primarily responsible for the relationship's failure",
                "To transition the couple into individual therapy sessions for the remainder of the program"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relational Scaffolding is about building a foundation of safety and communication (L1) so that the couple can eventually handle the 'weight' of deeper intimacy and vulnerability without collapsing."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "During Diagnostic Connection Mapping, a practitioner identifies a 'Pursuer-Distancer' dynamic. What is the standard strategic objective for the 'Distancer' in this map?",
            "options": [
                "To learn to retreat faster to avoid conflict",
                "To increase their criticism of the pursuer to balance the power",
                "To practice 'turning toward' bids for connection and identifying the 'freeze' response before withdrawing",
                "To ignore the pursuer until the pursuer stops demanding attention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Diagnostic Connection Mapping (L2), the goal for the distancer is to recognize their somatic withdrawal (freeze) and practice incremental engagement ('turning toward') to break the cycle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Strategic Sequencing (L3) dictates that 'Vulnerability Pacing' is essential. What is the risk of 'Flooding' the treatment plan with high-intensity intimacy goals too early?",
            "options": [
                "The couple will finish the program too quickly",
                "The couple may experience a 'vulnerability hangover' or somatic retraction, leading to increased defensiveness and dropout",
                "It causes the practitioner to lose revenue from shorter treatment durations",
                "It leads to 'Intimacy Overload,' which is a clinical term for excessive happiness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 emphasizes that pushing vulnerability too fast (pacing) can trigger the nervous system into a state of retraction or 'vulnerability hangover,' where partners pull back significantly to regain a sense of safety."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When designing Somatic Integration goals (L4), which physiological state is the 'Gold Standard' for co-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Hyper-arousal",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "The 'Fight' response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L4 identifies the Ventral Vagal state as the optimal 'Window of Tolerance' where co-regulation and genuine intimacy are possible."

            "id": "q21_5",

            "options": [
                "A history of mild verbal arguments",
                "Differing levels of sexual desire (Desire Discrepancy)",
                "Active, ongoing, and undisclosed physical domestic violence or coercive control",
                "One partner being more introverted than the other"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Risk Assessment (L5) mandates that active domestic violence/coercive control is a contraindication as true vulnerability requires a baseline of physical and psychological safety that cannot exist under those conditions."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A practitioner notices that after 4 weeks, a couple's 'Relational Safety Score' has plateaued despite consistent homework completion. According to L6, what is the most appropriate action?",
            "options": [
                "Terminate the treatment immediately",
                "Perform a 'Mid-Treatment Pivot' to reassess the diagnostic map and adjust the sequence of interventions",
                "Double the amount of homework to force a breakthrough",
                "Ignore the data and continue with the original 12-week plan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L6 (Outcome Measurement) teaches that when KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) plateau or regress, a pivot is necessary to address hidden saboteurs or incorrect sequencing."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Sustainable Intimacy Rituals' are distinguished by which characteristic?",

                "They must take at least 2 hours to complete to be effective",
                "They are 'low-friction' and integrated into the daily rhythm of the couple's life",
                "They require significant financial investment (e.g., luxury travel)",
                "They are performed only when the couple is in a state of conflict"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable rituals (L7) are micro-connections (like the 6-second kiss or the 10-minute daily check-in) that are low-friction and high-frequency, ensuring long-term relational mastery."

            "id": "q21_8",

                "A roadmap for legal separation",
                "A cohesive narrative synthesis of the couple's history, current saboteurs, and the strategic path toward their intimacy goals",
                "A script for the practitioner to read during every session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case Formulation (L8) is the professional synthesis of all data points into a clear, actionable roadmap that explains the 'why' behind the treatment plan."

                "Discussing their most painful childhood traumas",
                "Introducing advanced sexual toys and techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In L3, sequences start with de-escalation. Reducing criticism through softened start-ups is a prerequisite for more advanced or vulnerable work."

        {
            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "According to the statistics presented in L6, what percentage of treatment success is often attributed to the 'Quality of the Therapeutic Alliance' and the 'Clarity of the Treatment Plan'?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Exactly 100%",
                "Approximately 30-40% of the variance in outcomes",
                "It has no measurable impact on outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L6 references data showing that the alliance and the structured clarity of the treatment plan account for a significant portion (roughly 30-40%) of the success in relational interventions."
