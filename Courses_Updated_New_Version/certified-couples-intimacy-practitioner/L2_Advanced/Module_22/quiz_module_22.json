            "question": "An Intimacy Practitioner's 'Scope of Practice' is primarily distinguished from clinical sex therapy by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner's ability to prescribe pharmacological interventions for erectile dysfunction.",
                "A focus on present-state relational enhancement and education rather than diagnosing or treating psychopathological disorders.",
                "The legal right to perform internal physical examinations for sexual health mapping.",
                "The requirement to maintain absolute individual secrecy from the other partner at all times."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners focus on 'wellness-based' education and relational dynamics. They do not diagnose or treat clinical disorders found in the DSM-5, which is the domain of licensed therapists and medical doctors."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "Under the 'No Secrets' policy described in Lesson 3, what is the standard procedure when a partner shares a secret in an individual session that impacts the relationship?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner must immediately call the other partner and disclose the secret without the first partner's knowledge.",
                "The practitioner is legally obligated to keep the secret forever to protect the individual's privacy.",
                "The practitioner encourages the individual to disclose the information themselves and clarifies that the practitioner cannot hold secrets that undermine the joint work.",
                "The practitioner should terminate the coaching contract immediately without explanation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'No Secrets' policy ensures the practitioner remains neutral and the 'client' is the relationship itself. The practitioner works with the individual to bring relevant information into the joint space to maintain relational integrity."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "In the context of Somatic Intimacy (Lesson 2), 'Dynamic Informed Consent' implies that:",
            "options": [
                "Consent is a one-time signature on an intake form.",
                "Consent is assumed if the client does not verbally say 'No'.",
                "Consent is an ongoing, verbal and non-verbal process that can be withdrawn at any moment, even after an exercise has begun.",
                "Consent is only necessary for physical touch, not for emotional vulnerability exercises."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dynamic consent recognizes that physiological and emotional states change. A client may consent at the start but experience a 'freeze' response later; the practitioner must monitor and honor the right to withdraw consent at any time."

        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4, 'Multi-partiality' is a technique used to maintain neutrality by:",
            "options": [
                "Remaining completely silent and showing no emotion during sessions.",
                "Extending empathy and support to each partner's perspective sequentially, ensuring both feel 'allied' with the practitioner.",
                "Always agreeing with the partner who has the lower relational power to balance the scales.",
                "Refusing to work with couples who have differing political or religious views."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multi-partiality is 'balanced partiality.' Instead of being neutral (detached), the practitioner is 'partial' to everyone, validating each person's subjective experience while keeping the relationship's health as the primary goal."

            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 outlines Ethical Touch Protocols. Which of the following is a 'Red Flag' behavior for a practitioner regarding somatic work?",
            "options": [
                "Using a 'demo-assistant' or pillow to demonstrate a technique instead of touching the client.",

                "Providing touch that serves the practitioner's own emotional or physical needs for connection.",
                "Explaining the physiological purpose of a specific breathwork technique before starting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "All professional touch must be 'client-centric' and educational. If the touch provides any level of personal gratification or emotional soothing for the practitioner, it is a significant boundary violation."

                "A mutual decision to open the relationship to other partners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coercive control is a structural pattern of dominance that strips a partner of their autonomy. Unlike common conflict, it involves a power imbalance where one partner uses fear and isolation to maintain control."

                "Adopt a stance of cultural humility, acknowledging the couple's specific subculture and safety protocols (e.g., SSC or RACK).",
                "Refer the couple to a religious counselor to realign their values."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural competency involves understanding the specific ethics and safety frameworks within diverse relationship structures, such as 'Safe, Sane, and Consensual' (SSC) in the kink community, without pathologizing them."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, which of the following scenarios REQUIRES an immediate referral to a clinical professional?",

                "A client feeling 'bored' with their long-term monogamous relationship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active addiction, severe clinical depression, or untreated PTSD fall outside the scope of intimacy coaching and require clinical intervention to ensure the safety and stability of the clients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "During a somatic exercise, a client begins to shake and disassociate. Using the 'Ethical Somatic Integration' protocol from Lesson 5, what is the practitioner's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Pushing the client to finish the exercise to achieve a 'breakthrough'.",
                "Immediately pausing the exercise, ensuring physical safety, and using grounding techniques to bring the client back to the present.",
                "Leaving the room to give the client 'space' to process their emotions alone.",
                "Asking the other partner to take over the somatic lead while the practitioner takes notes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The safety and regulation of the client's nervous system are paramount. If a client enters a traumatic 'arousal' state (shaking/disassociation), the practitioner must stop the exercise and facilitate grounding."

        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "A practitioner realizes they are developing a strong romantic attraction to one of the partners in a couple they are coaching. According to Lesson 1, the most ethical course of action is:",

                "Discuss the attraction with the partner privately to see if it is mutual.",
                "Seek immediate supervision, and if the attraction interferes with neutrality, terminate the professional relationship and refer the couple to another practitioner.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioner self-awareness is key. If 'Counter-transference' (attraction) compromises the ability to be neutral or ethical, the practitioner must consult a supervisor and likely refer the clients out to protect the integrity of their work."
