            "question": "When utilizing Advanced Connection Mapping (L1), what is the primary indicator of an 'inherited' intergenerational blockage?",
            "options": [
                "A conscious decision to parent differently than one's own parents",
                "A repetitive, reflexive emotional reaction that lacks an immediate situational trigger in the current relationship",
                "A verbal agreement between partners to avoid discussing certain family members",
                "The presence of a diagnosed mental health condition in a previous generation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intergenerational blockages are often identified by 'phantom' reactions—reflexive emotional responses that don't match the current context but mirror the unresolved trauma or scripts of ancestors."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the context of Nuanced Language Alignment (L2), a client who describes intimacy as 'a mountain to be conquered' is operating under which subconscious script?",
            "options": [
                "An intimacy-as-nurturance script",
                "An intimacy-as-performance script",
                "An intimacy-as-adversity script",
                "An intimacy-as-transaction script"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metaphors involving struggle, climbing, or conquest indicate an 'adversity' script where intimacy is viewed as a difficult challenge rather than a safe connection."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "According to the protocols for Radical Vulnerability (L3), what is the 'Architecture of Shame-Free Disclosure'?",
            "options": [
                "A structured environment where partners are forbidden from speaking for 10 minutes",
                "A sequence that moves from physical sensation to emotional labeling to need-expression",
                "A legalistic agreement that anything said in the session cannot be used in future arguments",
                "A technique where the practitioner speaks for the client to reduce the client's direct exposure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shame-free disclosure requires grounding in the body (sensation) before moving to the cognitive labeling of emotions and finally the expression of specific needs."

            "question": "Advanced Somatic Integration (L4) uses 'Neuro-Sensory Bridging' (NSB) to primarily address which physiological state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NSB is specifically designed to bridge the gap between 'numb' or dissociated states (Dorsal Vagal) and the present moment through sensory tracking."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation relies on the biological 'mirroring' of the parasympathetic system; the Anchor Partner's slow exhalations signal safety to the other's nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For rituals to last, they must be consistent (predictable), meaningful (symbolic), and easy to perform (low friction)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical interventions remove the pressure of performance and the cycle of 'pursuer-distancer,' often bypassing the resistance that created 'The Wall.'"

                "The practitioner strictly adhering to the 50-minute session limit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subtle changes in a practitioner's behavior, such as grooming habits or a desire for client validation, are hallmark signs of counter-transference in intimacy work."

            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study on somatic interventions (n=450 couples) indicated that neuro-sensory bridging protocols improved intimacy satisfaction by what percentage compared to talk-only therapy?",

                "Terminating the relationship immediately",
                "Seeking clinical supervision to identify potential transference/counter-transference",
                "Asking the couple to pay for more sessions in advance",
                "Changing the therapeutic modality without informing the couple"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical mastery requires the practitioner to seek supervision first to ensure their own 'blind spots' or counter-transference aren't contributing to the couple's stagnation."
