            "question": "In the 'Intimacy History Architecture' (L1), what is the primary purpose of mapping transgenerational intimacy patterns?",
            "options": [
                "To assign blame to the clients' parents for current sexual dysfunction",
                "To identify inherited 'intimacy scripts' and unconscious blueprints that govern current relational behavior",
                "To provide a legal record of past relationship trauma for insurance purposes",
                "To determine if the couple should seek individual therapy instead of joint sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mapping transgenerational patterns allows practitioners to identify the 'scripts' or blueprints clients unconsciously follow, which often dictate their expectations and fears regarding intimacy."

            "options": [
                "The MMPI-3 Personality Inventory",
                "The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)",

                "The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Couples Satisfaction Index (CSI-32) has been shown in psychometric research to have higher precision and power than the DAS, making it more sensitive to detecting subtle shifts in relationship quality."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Dismissive-Avoidant' attachment style in the mapping phase (L3). What is their most likely somatic response during an intimacy assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-arousal and excessive verbalization of needs",
                "Physiological deactivation and a tendency to minimize the importance of physical closeness",
                "Immediate crying and seeking of physical reassurance from the practitioner",
                "A fluctuating heart rate that indicates disorganized fear"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dismissive-Avoidant individuals typically employ deactivating strategies, which somatically manifest as emotional distancing and the minimization of the need for intimacy to maintain a sense of self-reliance."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In Somatic Sensitivity & Sensory Threshold Assessment (L4), a client who is easily overwhelmed by light touch or specific textures is categorized as having:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Low sensory thresholds mean the nervous system reacts to minimal stimuli, leading to over-responsivity or a feeling of being 'flooded' by physical touch."

            "id": "q20_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological synchrony is the biological mirroring of nervous system states between partners, which can indicate either high attunement or shared distress during conflict."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in the C.L.O.S.E.R. framework stands for Resilience & Repair Capacity, measuring how effectively a couple can return to homeostasis after a rupture."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah and Mark score high on 'Conflict Synchrony' but low on 'Co-regulation Capacity.' What is the most likely outcome during an intimacy session?",
            "options": [
                "They will remain calm regardless of the topic",
                "They will both become rapidly dysregulated (flooded) and struggle to calm each other down",
                "Sarah will calm Mark down quickly while remaining upset herself",
                "They will effectively solve their problems through logic alone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High synchrony in conflict without co-regulation capacity often leads to 'mutual escalation,' where both partners' nervous systems spiral into dysregulation together."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Why is 'Integrated Synthesis' (L8) considered the most critical step of the assessment process?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is the longest part of the intake",
                "Because it converts isolated data points into a cohesive, actionable clinical narrative and roadmap",
                "Because it allows the practitioner to charge a higher fee",
                "Because it eliminates the need for further communication with the couple"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The synthesis is vital because it weaves together attachment, somatic, and psychometric data into a single 'roadmap' that guides the entire treatment plan."
