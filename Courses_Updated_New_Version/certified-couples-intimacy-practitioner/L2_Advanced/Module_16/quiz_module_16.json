            "options": [
                "A biological decline in pheromone production over time",
                "A psychological barrier where past hurts cause a partner to interpret neutral or positive touch as manipulative",
                "The physical distance created by separate sleeping arrangements",
                "A cognitive bias where one partner believes the other is no longer attractive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Resentment Filter is a psychological state where unresolved conflict colors every interaction, making even well-intentioned physical advances feel threatening or insincere to the partner holding resentment."

            "options": [
                "The betrayed partner must hide their pain to avoid 'triggering' the wayward partner",
                "The wayward partner must stop apologizing to move forward",
                "The betrayed partner must eventually risk being hurt again by opening up, while the wayward partner remains an 'emotional container' for their pain",
                "Both partners must agree to never discuss the details of the affair after the first 30 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The paradox is that the very thing that caused the pain (vulnerability/trust) is the only thing that can heal it, requiring the wayward partner to hold space for the betrayed partner's ongoing triggers."

            "question": "When working with neurodiverse couples, what is the primary goal of a 'Sensory Menu'?",
            "options": [
                "To plan a diet that increases libido through nutrition",
                "To identify specific tactile, auditory, and visual stimuli that cause overwhelm versus those that foster connection",
                "To ensure both partners are using the same sexual vocabulary",
                "To rank sexual positions from easiest to most difficult"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Sensory Menu helps neurodiverse couples navigate sensory processing differences by explicitly documenting what types of touch or environments lead to sensory overload or 'meltdowns' versus 'glimmers' of connection."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In high-conflict dynamics, what physiological threshold typically indicates that 'Diffuse Physiological Arousal' (DPA) has occurred, making productive communication impossible?",

                "A body temperature increase of 1.5 degrees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Based on Gottman's research, once the heart rate exceeds 100 BPM (for most people), the 'flooding' response occurs, shutting down the prefrontal cortex and making de-escalation the only viable immediate goal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Outer-course model prioritizes pleasure and connection over the 'biological imperative' of intercourse, allowing couples with physical limitations to maintain a robust and satisfying intimate life."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Touch Overload (often called being 'touched out') occurs when a primary caregiver's sensory system is saturated by the constant physical demands of children, leading to a temporary aversion to romantic touch."

            "options": [
                "It always leads to an increase in sexual frequency as a form of stress relief",
                "The partner with less financial control may use sexual withdrawal as their only remaining form of agency or 'veto power'",
                "It has no measurable effect on intimacy if the couple is 'in love'",
                "The higher earner always has a higher libido"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Financial imbalance often translates to power imbalances; the partner who feels disempowered in the 'boardroom' of the relationship may subconsciously reclaim power in the 'bedroom' through withholding."

            "id": "q16_8",

                "Prescribing specific intimacy exercises like Sensate Focus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, stabilization and safety must come first. You cannot build intimacy on a foundation of active trauma or ongoing betrayal; safety is the prerequisite for all other work."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "According to the lesson on high-conflict de-escalation, what is the '20-Minute Rule'?",

                "Foreplay should be exactly 20 minutes long"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "It takes approximately 20 minutes for the body to metabolize stress hormones (like cortisol and adrenaline) and for the heart rate to return to baseline after a 'flooding' event."

            "question": "Which strategy is most effective for a couple where one partner has ADHD and struggles with 'Intimacy Distractibility'?",
            "options": [
                "Strict sensory deprivation (complete darkness and silence)",

                "Ending the session if the partner loses focus",
                "Medicating the partner immediately before intimacy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For many with ADHD, low-stimulation environments allow the mind to wander; 'High-Stimulus Intimacy' provides enough sensory input to help the ADHD brain stay present in the moment."
