            "question": "In the context of 'The Architecture of Relational Synthesis' (L1), how is 'Relational Synthesis' fundamentally different from 'Relational Repair'?",
            "options": [
                "Repair focuses on fixing a specific past trauma, while synthesis focuses on future goals.",
                "Synthesis is the emergent property where the couple functions as a cohesive 'third entity' rather than two individuals fixing separate issues.",
                "Repair is a somatic process, whereas synthesis is purely a cognitive-behavioral process.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical mastery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis refers to the holistic emergence of a new relational dynamic (the 'Third') that is greater than the sum of the two individuals, whereas repair often focuses on returning to a previous baseline."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Connection Re-Mapping relies on Hebbian Theory, using repeated positive somatic and emotional experiences to create new, dominant neural pathways for intimacy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A shared lexicon acts as emotional shorthand, significantly reducing the cognitive effort required to convey complex feelings during moments of tension or vulnerability."

            "options": [
                "It provides a physical grounding point to prevent the nervous system from defaulting to a 'freeze' or 'flee' state.",
                "It serves as a distraction from the emotional pain of being seen.",
                "It is a requirement for insurance reimbursement in somatic coaching.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchors provide a physical reference point of safety, helping the nervous system remain in the ventral vagal state even when feeling emotionally exposed."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proactive co-regulation is about 'pre-emptive' stabilization, identifying early micro-cues of dysregulation to maintain safety before a full sympathetic spike occurs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Synthesis Plateau is often a result of Adaptive Homeostasis; introducing calculated novelty or 'pattern interrupts' helps move the couple into a higher level of integration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clinical mastery requires Empathic Resonance (feeling *with* the client while maintaining a boundary) rather than Emotional Contagion (taking on the client's stress as one's own)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that 'We-talk' (first-person plural pronouns) is a strong indicator of relational health, shared identity, and better physiological recovery during conflict."
