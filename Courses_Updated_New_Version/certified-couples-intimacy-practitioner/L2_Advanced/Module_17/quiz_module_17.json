            "options": [
                "The Neurodivergent partner lacks the biological capacity for empathy",
                "Both partners have different social cues and expectations, leading to a mutual lack of understanding",
                "The Neurotypical partner is intentionally ignoring the sensory needs of the other",
                "Neurodivergent individuals cannot process complex emotional states in others"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties in neuro-mixed relationships are a 'two-way street' resulting from different neurological processing styles, rather than a deficit in just one partner."

            "question": "According to the Gottman Trust Revival Method used in Lesson 2, what is the primary objective of the 'Atonement' phase following infidelity?",
            "options": [
                "Forgiving the betraying partner immediately to move toward intimacy",
                "Establishing a 'no-talk' rule regarding the affair to prevent further pain",
                "The betraying partner demonstrating total transparency and taking full accountability without defensiveness",
                "Negotiating new sexual boundaries for the future relationship"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Atonement requires the betraying partner to hear the hurt partner's pain, answer questions honestly (transparency), and express genuine remorse without making excuses."

                "The finite amount of physical and mental energy a person has to distribute among daily tasks",
                "The way partners 'spoon' or cuddle to reduce cortisol levels",
                "A specific type of physical therapy for mobility-impaired clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spoon Theory helps the healthy partner understand that the ill partner has a limited 'budget' of energy (spoons), and once they are used up, they cannot simply 'push through' to engage in intimacy."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client with CPTSD becomes 'numb,' 'spaced out,' or physically limp during an intimacy exercise. In Trauma-Informed Intimacy (Lesson 4), this state is known as:",

                "The Attack-Defend Loop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is a 'freeze' or 'shut down' response where the nervous system becomes overwhelmed and retreats into a state of numbness or dissociation."

            "options": [
                "A relationship where both partners have ceased all sexual activity",
                "A relationship where the substance use has stopped, but the dysfunctional behavioral patterns and lack of emotional intimacy remain",
                "A relationship that lacks adequate lubrication due to medication side effects",
                "A relationship where one partner is in recovery and the other is still actively using"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'dry' relationship mirrors the concept of a 'dry drunk'; the sobriety is physical, but the emotional and relational growth necessary for true intimacy has not yet occurred."

            "question": "For aging couples (Lesson 6), what is the clinical significance of 'Responsive Desire'?",
            "options": [
                "It is a dysfunction that needs to be treated with testosterone therapy",
                "It is desire that only occurs in response to a partner's verbal request",
                "It is desire that emerges after physical arousal or sensual touch has already begun, rather than being spontaneous",
                "It is the ability to respond to visual stimuli as one did in their 20s"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As couples age, spontaneous desire often wanes, but responsive desire—arousal that builds once the process of intimacy starts—remains a healthy and viable pathway to connection."

            "question": "In High-Conflict Dynamics (Lesson 7), 'Diffuse Physiological Arousal' (DPA) occurs when a partner's heart rate exceeds approximately 100 BPM. What is the practitioner's immediate priority in this state?",

                "Analyzing the childhood roots of the current conflict"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a partner is in DPA (flooded), the prefrontal cortex shuts down, making rational communication impossible. A 20-minute break is physiologically required for cortisol and adrenaline to subside."

            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Cultural Humility' over 'Cultural Competence.' What is the core difference?",
            "options": [
                "Humility is only for religious practitioners",
                "Competence implies an endpoint of 'knowing' a culture, while humility is a lifelong process of self-reflection and acknowledging power imbalances",
                "Humility requires the practitioner to apologize for their own culture",
                "Competence is only required for international clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility recognizes that the practitioner can never be a total expert on another's lived experience and must remain a curious, self-aware learner."

                "Increasing the frequency of high-intensity interval training (HIIT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensate Focus allows aging couples to explore pleasure without the 'pass/fail' pressure of penetration, which is often hindered by the physical changes of GSM or ED."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A practitioner working with a trauma survivor (Lesson 4) uses 'Pendulation.' This technique involves:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation helps trauma survivors expand their Window of Tolerance by 'dipping' into difficult sensations and then returning to a 'resource' or safe sensation to prevent flooding."
