            "question": "During an 'Amygdala Hijack' as described in Lesson 1, which neuroanatomical shift is most responsible for the loss of rational decision-making?",
            "options": [
                "The rapid activation of the parasympathetic nervous system via the Vagus nerve.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In an Amygdala Hijack, the amygdala's rapid response bypasses the slower Prefrontal Cortex, essentially taking the 'executive' brain offline and prioritizing instinctive, survival-based reactions."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Neuro-Assessment (Lesson 2), what is 'Neural Masking'?",

                "A diagnostic tool used to measure synaptic density in the temporal lobe.",
                "The ability of the brain to hide structural damage through neuroplasticity.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neural Masking occurs in complex comorbidities when the symptoms of one neurological or psychological condition hide the presence of another, requiring advanced assessment to untangle the 'N' in the NEURON framework."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Treatment-resistant neural loops (Lesson 3) are primarily maintained through which neurobiological mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Maladaptive neural loops become 'hard-wired' through Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), where repeated activation of a specific pathway strengthens the synaptic connections, making the behavior or thought pattern resistant to standard interventions."

                "A decrease in glutamate levels that slows down neural communication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Following a TBI, a neuro-metabolic cascade occurs where ionic shifts (Potassium leaving the cell, Calcium entering) force the brain to use massive amounts of energy (ATP) to restore balance, creating a 'metabolic energy crisis'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Crisis stabilization ethics dictate that active psychosis (hallucinations) or suicidal ideation are outside the scope of coaching and require immediate clinical/emergency intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged exposure to high cortisol levels during chronic stress/burnout is neurotoxic to the Hippocampus, leading to dendritic atrophy and reduced volume, which impairs memory and emotional regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The STAC model posits that the aging brain performs 'scaffolding'—recruiting alternative neural pathways to maintain cognitive function despite structural decline in traditional areas."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "In the NEURON Case Synthesis (Lesson 8), what is the primary goal of the 'E' (Environment) phase when dealing with a client in extremis?",
            "options": [
                "To teach the client complex neurobiology theories.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-stakes cases, the 'Environment' phase focuses on stabilization—reducing sensory overload and removing physiological or external stressors that keep the nervous system in a state of hyper-arousal."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 3 suggests that to successfully 'interrupt' a treatment-resistant neural loop, the intervention must:",

                "Be subtle enough that the client doesn't notice the change.",
                "Be performed only once a month to avoid overstimulation.",
                "Involve high-intensity 'pattern interrupts' that challenge the existing neural heuristic.",
                "Focus exclusively on pharmacological options without behavioral change."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To break a 'hard-wired' maladaptive loop, the specialist must use pattern interrupts that are significant enough to break the automated neural sequence, followed by the reinforcement of a new, adaptive pathway."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Second Impact Syndrome' concerns after a minor fall. According to Lesson 4, why is this condition so critical?",
            "options": [
                "It causes an immediate loss of hearing in both ears.",
                "It involves rapid, often fatal brain swelling when a second TBI occurs before the first has healed.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Second Impact Syndrome (SIS) is a rare but catastrophic condition where a second concussion occurs while the brain is still in the 'metabolic crisis' phase of the first, leading to rapid, uncontrollable cerebral edema."
