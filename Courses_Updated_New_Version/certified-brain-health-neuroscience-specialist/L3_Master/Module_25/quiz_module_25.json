            "question": "According to the neuroscience of mentorship (L1), what phenomenon occurs when a mentor and mentee achieve high levels of 'neural synchrony' during a session?",
            "options": [
                "The mentee's brain waves mirror the mentor's exactly in the occipital lobe.",
                "Inter-brain phase-locking occurs, primarily in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) and prefrontal cortex.",
                "The mentor's amygdala becomes hyper-active to signal danger to the mentee.",
                "Both brains enter a 'beta-wave' dominant state to ensure rapid fact memorization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural synchrony, or inter-brain phase-locking, involves the alignment of neural activity between two individuals, particularly in areas associated with social cognition like the rTPJ and prefrontal cortex, facilitating deeper understanding and learning."

            "question": "In the N.E.U.R.O.N. Framework™ for supervision (L2), what does the 'O' stand for, and what is its primary focus?",
            "options": [
                "Operational Efficiency; focusing on the business side of the clinical practice.",
                "Oxytocin Release; focusing on building a warm, friendly relationship with the supervisee.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in the N.E.U.R.O.N. Framework™ stands for Objective Observation, which requires the supervisor to monitor the supervisee's clinical work while intentionally filtering out their own countertransference and personal biases."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reward Prediction Error occurs when there is a mismatch between expected and actual outcomes. This triggers dopamine signals in the ventral striatum, which is a key driver for neuroplasticity and professional learning."

                "The right of the practitioner to refuse to learn about neuroscience if it conflicts with their personal beliefs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural Privacy in a supervisory context refers to the ethical boundary of respecting a supervisee's private thoughts and mental autonomy, ensuring the power dynamic of supervision doesn't lead to 'cognitive coercion.'"

                "The rapid switching between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Attentional Blink' refers to the neural limitation where the brain cannot process a second stimulus if it occurs too quickly after a first, often leading practitioners to miss 'blind spot' data while focused on a primary diagnosis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Default Mode Network (DMN) is heavily involved in social cognition, mentalizing (thinking about what others are thinking), and self-referential processing, which are core components of group supervision dynamics."

            "id": "q25_7",

            "options": [
                "Procedural knowledge is stored in the basal ganglia and cerebellum and is demonstrated through action, not just verbal explanation.",
                "Declarative knowledge requires an fMRI to verify, whereas procedural knowledge does not.",
                "Procedural knowledge is only present in senior practitioners with 20+ years of experience.",
                "The brain forgets procedural knowledge faster than declarative facts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Declarative knowledge (facts) is easy to test via written exams, but Procedural knowledge (skills/application) is stored in different brain regions (basal ganglia/cerebellum) and can only be assessed by observing the practitioner in action."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Network Mastery is the leadership skill of building a 'professional connectome'—a community where practitioners are linked in ways that promote collective intelligence, resource sharing, and legacy building."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "A supervisor notices a practitioner consistently over-diagnosing 'anxiety' in clients who exhibit diverse symptoms. This is an example of which 'Blind Spot' discussed in Lesson 5?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pattern Entrenchment or the Availability Heuristic occurs when a practitioner's brain becomes 'primed' to see a specific diagnosis because it is familiar or recently used, leading them to ignore contradictory evidence."

            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'Neuro-Supervision' mentioned in the module found that supervisors who utilized 'Synchronous Feedback' (feedback during the session) vs. 'Delayed Feedback' saw what result in supervisee skill acquisition?",
            "options": [
                "Delayed feedback was 50% more effective because it allowed for hippocampus consolidation.",
                "Synchronous feedback caused 'amygdala hijack' and reduced learning by 30%.",
                "Synchronous feedback led to faster procedural 'tuning' but required higher cognitive load from the supervisor.",
                "There was no measurable difference in the neural pathways of the supervisees."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synchronous feedback (real-time) allows for immediate error correction and 'procedural tuning' of the motor and cognitive circuits, though it is more taxing for the supervisor to manage while maintaining the session flow."
