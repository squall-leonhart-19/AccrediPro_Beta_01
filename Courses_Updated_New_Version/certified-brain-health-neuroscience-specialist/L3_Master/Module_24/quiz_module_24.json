            "id": "q24_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Precision Neuro-Assessment' is defined by moving beyond subjective intake. What is the primary objective of integrating biometric data (like HRV or EEG) with cognitive load testing?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders",
                "To identify the 'Neurological Gap' between perceived capacity and actual neural output",
                "To replace the need for client interviews entirely",
                "To satisfy insurance requirements for neuro-rehab"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners use precision tools to identify the 'Neurological Gap,' which is the discrepancy between what a client thinks they can handle and what their nervous system is actually processing."

        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "During the 'Establish' phase of Neuroplasticity Engineering (Lesson 2), what role does the 'Plasticity Window' play?",
            "options": [
                "It is the 20-minute period after exercise when BDNF is at its peak for learning",
                "It is the first 5 minutes of a coaching session",
                "It is the age range (under 25) where the brain is most flexible",
                "It is the specific time of day based on the client's chronotype only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Plasticity Window refers to the period of heightened neuroplasticity, often triggered by aerobic exercise or specific primers, where Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels are optimized for new synaptic connections."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, 'Competitive Interference' is used to disrupt maladaptive loops. How does this mechanism function?",
            "options": [
                "By punishing the client for engaging in the old habit",
                "By using a 'Pattern Interrupt' that uses the same neural real estate as the maladaptive loop",
                "By ignoring the old habit and focusing only on positive affirmations",
                "By chemically inhibiting the amygdala"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Competitive Interference involves introducing a new, more intense stimulus that utilizes the same neural pathways or 'real estate' as the old habit, effectively 'crowding out' the maladaptive loop."

        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 outlines the 'Triad of Recalibration' for stimulating synaptogenesis. Which three components make up this triad?",
            "options": [
                "Sleep, Nutrition, and Hydration",
                "Memory, Emotion, and Logic",
                "Novelty, Intensity, and Repetition",
                "Assessment, Intervention, and Feedback"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To stimulate the growth of new synapses (synaptogenesis), a Master Practitioner must ensure the stimulus is Novel (new to the brain), Intense (high engagement), and Repeated (to strengthen the connection)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner conducting a 'Sensory Audit' (Lesson 5) finds a client is working in an environment with high 'Acoustic Chaos.' What is the likely neuro-consequence?",
            "options": [
                "Increased activation of the prefrontal cortex",
                "Chronic elevation of cortisol and reduced auditory gating efficiency",
                "Enhanced focus due to the 'Stochastic Resonance' effect",
                "Permanent damage to the hippocampus within 24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acoustic chaos or chronic noise pollution leads to 'auditory fatigue,' which elevates cortisol and reduces the brain's ability to filter out irrelevant information (auditory gating)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Network Mastery, why is 'Strategic Spacing' essential for scaling Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)?",
            "options": [
                "To allow the client to forget the information so it can be relearned",
                "To prevent 'Synaptic Saturation' and allow for protein synthesis required for long-term storage",
                "To make the coaching program last longer for revenue purposes",
                "To reduce the amount of work the coach has to do"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LTP scaling requires intervals because synapses can become 'saturated.' Spacing allows the brain to undergo the protein synthesis necessary to move a connection from short-term to long-term storage."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, when managing complex co-morbidities (e.g., Anxiety and Chronic Pain), what is the 'Hierarchy of Intervention'?",
            "options": [
                "Treat the symptoms alphabetically",
                "Address the most 'neurologically noisy' or high-arousal system first",
                "Always treat the physical pain before the psychological anxiety",
                "Treat the oldest symptom first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hierarchy of Intervention dictates that practitioners should address the system generating the most 'noise' or threat-response (usually the high-arousal system) to create the safety needed for other interventions to work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Scope of Practice.' Which of the following actions would be a violation of professional ethics for a Brain Health Specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Using an EEG headset to track a client's focus levels during a task",
                "Suggesting a client switch their antidepressant medication based on neuro-data",
                "Explaining the role of the amygdala in a client's stress response",
                "Designing a sensory-friendly workspace for a client with ADHD"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners must never diagnose or prescribe medical treatments, including altering medications. This is a strict boundary between coaching/specialist work and clinical medicine."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'frozen' state when faced with public speaking. Using the 'Uncoupling' skills from Lesson 3, you introduce a proprioceptive task (balancing on one leg). Why does this help?",
            "options": [
                "It distracts the client so they forget they are nervous",
                "It shifts neural resources from the Default Mode Network (rumination) to the Task Positive Network",
                "It lowers the client's heart rate immediately through the diving reflex",
                "It strengthens the calf muscles, which are linked to confidence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive challenges require active neural processing, shifting the brain from the Default Mode Network (where rumination and fear loops live) to the Task Positive Network (focused on the present physical demand)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 8, what is 'Practice Mastery' primarily focused on?",
            "options": [
                "Memorizing every single part of the brain",
                "The ethical integration of neuroscience into a sustainable, high-value professional brand",
                "Learning how to perform neurosurgery",
                "Using as much technical jargon as possible to impress clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practice Mastery is about the professional application of skills—ensuring that deep neuroscientific knowledge is paired with ethical branding and high-level client results."
