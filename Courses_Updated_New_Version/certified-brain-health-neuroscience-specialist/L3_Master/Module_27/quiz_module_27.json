            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Optimization for Executive Leadership, 'decision fatigue' is primarily localized to the depletion of metabolic resources in which brain region?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Basal Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dlPFC is responsible for executive functions like complex decision-making and impulse control; as it consumes high amounts of glucose and oxygen, its efficiency drops after prolonged use, leading to decision fatigue."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Neuroscience research on resilience in high-stakes environments indicates that 'stress-hardy' individuals typically exhibit which neural characteristic?",
            "options": [
                "Increased amygdala reactivity to neutral stimuli",
                "Reduced white matter integrity in the corpus callosum",

                "Complete suppression of the HPA axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resilience is characterized by 'top-down' regulation where the vmPFC effectively modulates and dampens the amygdala's threat response, allowing for emotional stability under pressure."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "When coaching neurodivergent clients with ADHD, the 'Interest-Based Nervous System' implies that dopamine release is triggered primarily by which factor, rather than importance or rewards?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike neurotypical brains that respond to 'importance,' the ADHD brain is driven by the 'INCUP' criteria: Interest, Novelty, Challenge, Urgency, and Passion."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "According to the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC), how does the aging brain maintain high-level performance despite structural decline?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the speed of neural transmission in the primary motor cortex",
                "By recruiting additional, alternative neural circuits to perform tasks",

                "By reverting to purely reflexive, brainstem-driven behaviors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The brain uses 'scaffolding'—recruiting compensatory pathways and bilateral activation—to maintain cognitive function when primary networks show age-related decay."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In the neuroscience of behavioral addictions, what is the primary result of chronic overstimulation of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To protect itself from dopamine surges, the brain reduces the number of available D2 receptors (downregulation), which makes the individual less sensitive to normal pleasures and drives the need for higher stimulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Trauma-informed neuro-coaching emphasizes 'Bottom-Up' regulation. Which intervention best exemplifies this approach?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up interventions target the autonomic nervous system and brainstem first to create safety before engaging the 'top-down' analytical powers of the PFC."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Elite athletes exhibit a longer, more stable 'Quiet Eye' period, which allows the brain to finish the motor programming required for an accurate movement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Liberty is a fundamental ethical principle protecting an individual from forced neuro-interventions and ensuring they have control over their own mental processes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cognitive reserve (built through education, complex work, and social engagement) can delay the functional symptoms of Alzheimer's by up to 5 years, even if pathology is present."

                "Encouraging them to 'try harder' to remember the time",
                "Using analog clocks to provide a visual representation of time 'passing'",
                "Removing all clocks to reduce anxiety",
                "Focusing exclusively on past failures to build motivation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Analog clocks externalize the passage of time (a function usually managed internally by the PFC/Cerebellum), making it a 'visual' resource that supports the ADHD brain's executive gaps."
