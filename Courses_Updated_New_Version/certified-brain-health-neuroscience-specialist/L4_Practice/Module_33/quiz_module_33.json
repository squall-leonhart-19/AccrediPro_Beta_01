            "question": "A client presents a Certified Brain Health Specialist with a clinical fMRI report and asks for a diagnosis of their recurring headaches. What is the legally compliant response?",
            "options": [
                "Interpret the scan based on neuroscience training but avoid prescribing medication.",
                "Explain that as a non-clinical specialist, you cannot diagnose medical conditions and refer them to a neurologist.",
                "Use a neuro-imaging AI tool to provide a 'preliminary' assessment for the client.",
                "Provide a diagnosis only if the specialist has a PhD in Neuroscience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Defining the Scope of Practice (L1) requires specialists to distinguish between 'wellness/optimization' and 'clinical diagnosis.' Diagnosing medical conditions like headaches via fMRI is strictly within the medical/neurological scope."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-ethics (L2) emphasizes that neural data is 'ultimate' private data. Mental privacy ensures that brain activity cannot be collected or sold without granular, informed consent."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional Liability (L3) is measured against the 'Standard of Care,' which is the industry benchmark for what a reasonable peer would do in a similar situation."

                "The clients who participated in the protocol own the rights.",
                "The IP is considered 'public domain' because it involves neuroscience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Contract Law (L4), independent contractors generally retain ownership of their creations unless a written agreement states otherwise, unlike traditional employees under 'Work Made for Hire' doctrines."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regulatory Compliance (L5) notes that if a device is intended for 'wellness' and does not claim to treat or diagnose a disease, it is usually categorized as a Low-Risk General Wellness Product."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "International Practice (L7) dictates that specialists must often comply with the regulations of the client's location, particularly regarding telehealth and data privacy (e.g., CCPA in California)."
