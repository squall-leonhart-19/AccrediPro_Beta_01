                "It allows the practitioner to skip the initial assessment",
                "It ensures the client cannot request a refund"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Automation in neuro-health is designed to reduce the client's friction and cognitive load, leading to higher compliance with the brain-health protocols."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because neuro-technology and research evolve rapidly, a team member's 'neuro-plasticity'—their ability to unlearn old methods and adopt new, evidence-based protocols—is critical."

            "question": "In the 'Neuro-Ethics' of marketing, why is it considered high-risk to use 'Before & After' brain scans as the sole proof of efficacy?",
            "options": [
                "Because brain scans are too expensive to print",
                "Neuro-variability means a single 'after' scan may not represent permanent functional change",
                "Clients do not understand what brain scans look like",
                "It is illegal to show brain scans in all 50 states"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing acknowledges neuro-variability; a single scan can be influenced by temporary factors (sleep, caffeine), so it should not be used as the 'only' proof of long-term clinical success."
