            "question": "According to the Dual Process Theory discussed in Lesson 1, which neural system is primarily responsible for the rapid, emotional 'gut reaction' a prospect has to a marketing headline?",
            "options": [
                "System 1 (Limbic-driven, fast, and intuitive)",
                "System 2 (Prefrontal-driven, slow, and analytical)",
                "The Cerebellum (Motor-driven and reflexive)",
                "The Occipital Lobe (Visual processing only)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "System 1 is the fast, instinctive, and emotional brain system. Effective marketing first captures System 1 to gain attention before System 2 engages to justify the purchase logically."

            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "What is the primary strategic purpose of utilizing the N.E.U.R.O.N. Framework™ as a 'Category of One' USP (Unique Selling Proposition)?",
            "options": [
                "To compete with lower-priced health coaches on social media",
                "To commoditize brain health services for mass-market appeal",
                "To move the specialist away from 'comparison shopping' by offering a proprietary, science-backed methodology",
                "To reduce the amount of content needed for marketing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A proprietary framework like N.E.U.R.O.N. differentiates the specialist from generalists, making their services incomparable to others and allowing for premium pricing."

            "question": "In Lesson 3, why is a 12-to-16 week duration recommended for high-ticket brain health programs?",
            "options": [
                "It is the maximum time a client can stay focused",
                "It aligns with the biological timelines required for measurable structural neuroplasticity and habit consolidation",
                "It is a standard industry requirement for insurance billing",
                "It allows for more billing cycles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term potentiation and structural changes in the brain (neuroplasticity) require consistent stimulus over several months to become permanent, justifying the length of high-ticket interventions."

            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "Authority-Based Content Strategy (Lesson 4) suggests using 'Educational Friction.' What does this concept entail?",
            "options": [
                "Making content intentionally difficult to read to seem smarter",
                "Creating complex barriers to entry for social media followers",
                "Providing deep, high-value insights that require cognitive engagement to filter for high-intent clients",
                "Arguing with peers in the industry to gain attention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Educational friction involves providing high-level content that attracts serious, high-intent clients while naturally filtering out those who are not ready for a deep, science-based intervention."

            "id": "q31_5",

            "options": [
                "To ensure the specialist doesn't forget their script",
                "To activate the prospect's mirror neurons, fostering a sense of safety and co-regulation that lowers amygdala activation",
                "To show the prospect that the specialist is superior",
                "To speed up the closing process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Through mirror neurons, a prospect subconsciously picks up on the coach's physiological state. A calm, regulated coach helps the prospect feel safe, allowing their prefrontal cortex to make a rational decision."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "It triggers a fear response (fight or flight)",
                "It reduces cognitive load by making the brain work harder",
                "It activates the brain's reward system, reducing the perceived risk of the investment through social validation",
                "It has no effect on decision-making"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Seeing others succeed or engage in a group setting (Social Proof) activates the reward centers (Ventral Striatum) and reduces the 'threat' perceived by the amygdala regarding a new purchase."

            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses Practice Optimization. If your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is $400 and your Program Price (LTV) is $4,000, what is your LTV:CAC ratio?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LTV ($4,000) divided by CAC ($400) equals 10. A 10:1 ratio is exceptionally strong, indicating highly efficient marketing and significant room for scaling."

            "question": "Which cognitive bias, mentioned in the Neuro-Sales lesson, explains why prospects are often more motivated by 'avoiding cognitive decline' than by 'improving performance'?",

                "Loss Aversion",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Loss Aversion (Kahneman & Tversky) suggests that the pain of losing something (or declining) is psychologically twice as powerful as the joy of gaining something, making it a potent motivator in health marketing."

            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "What is the primary flaw in 'Hourly Billing' for a Brain Health Specialist compared to 'Value-Based Program Pricing'?",
            "options": [
                "Hourly billing is too difficult to track",
                "Hourly billing anchors the specialist's value to 'time' rather than the 'neurological outcome' and ROI for the client",
                "Most clients prefer to pay by the hour",
                "Value-based pricing is illegal in most states"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing commoditizes the specialist's time. Value-based pricing focuses on the transformation (e.g., recovering cognitive function), which is worth far more to the client than an hour of consultation."
