            "question": "What is the fundamental difference between a traditional clinical neurological exam and the AccrediPro Neuro-Assessment Paradigm?",
            "options": [
                "Clinical exams focus on identifying pathology and disease, while Neuro-Assessment focuses on sub-clinical optimization and functional performance.",
                "Clinical exams use digital tools, while Neuro-Assessment relies exclusively on manual reflex testing.",
                "Neuro-Assessment is designed to diagnose Alzheimer's, whereas clinical exams are for general health.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in professional neuroscience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Neuro-Assessment Paradigm shifts the focus from 'waiting for dysfunction' (pathology) to 'proactive optimization' (functional performance) by looking at sub-clinical markers that don't yet meet the threshold for medical diagnosis."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "When utilizing the Cognitive Symptom Inventory (CSI), a client reports high levels of 'brain fog' despite scoring within the normal range on objective cognitive tests. This discrepancy is known as:",
            "options": [
                "Malingering",
                "Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD)",
                "Anosognosia",
                "The Placebo Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) occurs when an individual perceives a decline in cognitive capacity that is not yet measurable by standardized objective tests; it is often an early warning sign of neuro-metabolic stress."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Which digital biomarker is considered the most reliable non-invasive proxy for measuring the 'Stress-Brain Axis' and autonomic nervous system (ANS) flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "Resting Heart Rate (RHR)",
                "Respiratory Rate",

                "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between heartbeats, reflecting the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and the brain's ability to regulate stress."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In a Stress-Brain Axis Assessment, what does a 'blunted' or flat Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Exceptional stress resilience and high performance.",
                "Acute, short-term excitement regarding the day's tasks.",
                "Chronic HPA-axis dysregulation and potential burnout or exhaustion.",
                "A healthy transition from sleep to wakefulness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 35-60% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A flat or blunted response suggests the HPA axis is no longer responding appropriately to the 'stress' of waking, often due to chronic stress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HbA1c measures average blood sugar over 3 months. Levels in the pre-diabetic range (5.7%+) are associated with insulin resistance, which impairs brain glucose metabolism and can lead to hippocampal atrophy."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "During an Environmental and Sensory Audit, why is the presence of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) specifically highlighted as a neuro-risk factor?",
            "options": [
                "It causes temporary hearing loss.",
                "It can bypass the blood-brain barrier via the olfactory bulb, triggering neuroinflammation.",
                "It increases the absorption of Vitamin D in the skin.",
                "It only affects the lungs and has no direct impact on the central nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PM2.5 particles are small enough to enter the bloodstream and, more critically, travel directly to the brain via the olfactory nerves, where they can trigger microglial activation and chronic neuroinflammation."

            "id": "q1_7",

                "Brain Reserve is software-based; Cognitive Reserve is hardware-based.",
                "Brain Reserve refers to physical brain size and neuron count; Cognitive Reserve refers to the efficiency of neural networks and compensatory strategies.",
                "Brain Reserve is developed in adulthood; Cognitive Reserve is strictly genetic.",
                "There is no difference; they both refer to the number of synapses in the prefrontal cortex."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brain Reserve (passive) is the physical 'hardware' (size, neuron count), while Cognitive Reserve (active) is the 'software'—the brain's ability to use alternative pathways to maintain function despite physical damage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Biological Foundation' must be addressed first. It is difficult to improve executive function or cognitive performance if the brain is deprived of sleep, poorly fueled (metabolism), or inflamed."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A 52-year-old executive presents with 'mental fatigue' and poor decision-making. Assessment shows: HRV of 18ms (Low), HbA1c of 5.8% (Borderline), and 5.5 hours of fragmented sleep. What is the primary assessment conclusion?",
            "options": [
                "The client has early-onset Alzheimer's disease.",
                "The client is experiencing 'Neuro-Metabolic Burnout' driven by sympathetic dominance and poor glucose regulation.",
                "The client's cognitive reserve is so high that no intervention is needed.",
                "The client needs immediate intensive memory training exercises."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of low HRV (sympathetic dominance), elevated HbA1c (metabolic distress), and sleep deprivation points to a systemic 'burnout' profile rather than a primary cognitive disorder."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A 2018 study published in 'Science' demonstrated that just one night of sleep deprivation leads to a significant increase in which neurotoxic metabolite in the human brain?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that a single night of sleep deprivation resulted in a significant increase in Beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, due to the impairment of the glymphatic clearance system."
