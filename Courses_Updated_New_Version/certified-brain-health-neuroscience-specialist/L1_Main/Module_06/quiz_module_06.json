        {
            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "During Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), what is the primary mechanism that strengthens the synaptic connection between two neurons?",
            "options": [
                "The permanent removal of NMDA receptors to prevent over-excitation",
                "The insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the post-synaptic membrane",
                "The immediate myelination of the axon following a single stimulus",
                "The shrinking of the synaptic cleft to allow faster neurotransmitter travel"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LTP involves 'upregulation,' specifically increasing the number of AMPA receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, which makes the neuron more sensitive to future glutamate release."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Which brain structure is the primary driver of 'automation,' shifting a behavior from the effortful Prefrontal Cortex to a subconscious habit?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Basal Ganglia (specifically the Striatum)",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia, particularly the striatum, is responsible for habit formation and the 'chunking' of behaviors, allowing them to be executed with minimal conscious oversight."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Long-Term Depression (LTD) is often misunderstood as 'forgetting.' In the context of Network Mastery, what is the functional purpose of LTD?",
            "options": [
                "To clear out all neural pathways to make room for new ones every 24 hours",
                "To selectively weaken synapses that are no longer being used, preventing 'neural noise'",
                "To trigger apoptosis (cell death) in the prefrontal cortex",
                "To increase the speed of electrical signals across the synapse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LTD is a 'sculpting' process. By weakening unused or low-frequency connections, the brain reduces noise and allows the most important (LTP-strengthened) pathways to stand out."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Structural Resilience, what is the key difference between 'Brain Reserve' and 'Cognitive Reserve'?",
            "options": [
                "Brain Reserve refers to physical hardware (size/neurons); Cognitive Reserve refers to functional software (efficiency/adaptability)",
                "Brain Reserve is developed in adulthood; Cognitive Reserve is strictly genetic",
                "Cognitive Reserve is physical brain volume; Brain Reserve is the speed of thought",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in neuroscience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Brain Reserve is quantitative (physical size, neuron count), while Cognitive Reserve is qualitative (how efficiently the brain uses its networks to compensate for damage)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In the 'Hyper-Consistency' model, why is frequency (how often) generally more important than intensity (how hard) for long-term network mastery?",
            "options": [
                "High intensity causes the brain to enter a permanent state of fight-or-flight",
                "Frequency triggers the repeated glia-mediated myelination necessary for signal speed",
                "The brain can only process information for 10 minutes at a time",
                "Intensity actually causes synapses to shrink via LTD"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency and repetition signal to oligodendrocytes that a pathway is important, triggering the layering of myelin which increases signal conduction speed by up to 100x."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "A client is struggling to change a deep-seated habit. Which 'Metacognitive Mastery' technique involves the Prefrontal Cortex monitoring the 'Executive Network' to catch errors in real-time?",
            "options": [
                "Passive Observation",
                "Subconscious Chunking",
                "Metacognitive Monitoring (Self-Correction)",
                "Social Synapse Mirroring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metacognitive monitoring allows the individual to observe their own thought processes and behaviors, providing the 'top-down' control needed to override automated Basal Ganglia loops."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "How does the 'Social Synapses' phenomenon reinforce individual neural networks during community learning?",
            "options": [
                "By reducing the amount of glucose the brain requires to learn",
                "Through the release of oxytocin and dopamine, which enhance synaptic plasticity and reward",
                "By forcing the brain to use the cerebellum instead of the cortex",
                "Social interaction has been proven to have no effect on neural network strength"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social engagement triggers neurochemical rewards (oxytocin/dopamine) that act as 'fertilizer' for LTP, making the learning experience more salient and durable."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "The Network Mastery Protocol™ suggests 'Interleaved Practice.' What does this involve?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing on a single task for 8 hours straight without breaks",
                "Mixing different topics or skills within a single study session to force the brain to distinguish between them",
                "Listening to white noise while sleeping to trigger LTD",
                "Only practicing skills that the client is already proficient in"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interleaving (mixing tasks) forces the brain to constantly reload information from long-term memory, which strengthens the retrieval pathways more effectively than 'blocked' practice."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that individuals with high Cognitive Reserve could delay the clinical onset of Alzheimer's symptoms by approximately how long?",
            "options": [
                "6 months",
                "1-2 years",
                "Up to 5 years",
                "Cognitive reserve does not delay symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that high cognitive reserve can allow the brain to function normally despite significant pathology, delaying clinical symptoms by up to 5 years."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary 'Rule of Integration' in the Network Mastery Protocol™?",
            "options": [
                "Avoid sleep for the first 24 hours after learning a new skill",
                "The 24-Hour/7-Day/30-Day Review Cycle",
                "Learning only through visual stimuli to maximize the occipital lobe",
                "Reducing water intake to increase neurotransmitter concentration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Protocol emphasizes spaced repetition (24h, 7d, 30d) to combat the 'Forgetting Curve' and ensure that temporary LTP transitions into permanent structural changes."
