            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the molecular signaling pathway for neuroplasticity, what is the specific relationship between Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and the mTOR pathway?",
            "options": [
                "BDNF binds to TrkB receptors, which activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to trigger mTOR-mediated protein synthesis",
                "mTOR acts as a precursor molecule that is cleaved to create active BDNF",
                "BDNF and mTOR are antagonistic; mTOR must be inhibited for BDNF to function",
                "mTOR is only found in the peripheral nervous system, while BDNF is central"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BDNF acts as the 'fertilizer' that triggers the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which is the primary driver of protein synthesis required for structural plasticity and dendritic spine growth."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the science of habit extinction, 'uncoupling' a maladaptive circuit requires the strengthening of which specific neural connection?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extinction is not the 'deletion' of a habit but the development of top-down inhibitory control where the vmPFC signals to the amygdala and striatum to suppress the old response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Anterior Insula is the key node of the Salience Network; it detects relevant stimuli and switches the brain from internal 'daydreaming' (DMN) to external 'execution' (TPN)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During N3 (Slow-Wave Sleep), the expansion of the interstitial space allows Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) to flush out metabolic waste, such as beta-amyloid, at a much higher rate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural efficiency means the brain does more with less; elite performers show 'quiet' brains with specific, highly myelinated circuits firing rather than global, inefficient activation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHEA acts as a neuro-steroid that buffers the negative effects of cortisol. A higher ratio of DHEA to Cortisol is a biomarker for better stress tolerance and cognitive recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myelin acts as insulation, allowing the electrical impulse to skip across the gaps (Nodes of Ranvier), which can increase transmission speed by up to 100 times compared to unmyelinated fibers."
