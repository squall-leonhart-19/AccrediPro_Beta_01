            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Which brain structure acts as the primary 'brake' for the HPA axis by providing negative feedback to inhibit further cortisol release?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex",
                "The Pituitary Gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hippocampus has a high density of glucocorticoid receptors; it senses high cortisol levels and sends inhibitory signals to the hypothalamus to terminate the stress response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "During an 'Amygdala Hijack,' what occurs neurobiologically to the 'high road' of emotional processing?",
            "options": [
                "The thalamo-cortical pathway is bypassed in favor of the faster thalamo-amygdala route.",
                "The prefrontal cortex increases its inhibitory control over the limbic system.",
                "The vagus nerve increases parasympathetic tone to compensate.",
                "The hippocampus strengthens the contextual memory of the event instantly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An amygdala hijack occurs when the 'low road' (direct thalamus-to-amygdala) triggers a response before the 'high road' (thalamus-to-cortex) can rationally process the stimulus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Chronic rumination is characterized by a failure to switch between which two neural networks?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic and Parasympathetic networks",

                "The Broca's area and Wernicke's area"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resilience involves the ability to switch from the DMN (self-referential/rumination) to the TPN (external focus/action). Chronic stress often 'locks' the brain in an overactive DMN state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client with high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) typically demonstrates:",
            "options": [
                "A rigid autonomic nervous system dominated by sympathetic activity.",
                "Greater 'vagal tone' and increased emotional regulation capacity.",
                "A higher risk for HPA axis exhaustion and hypocortisolism.",
                "A consistent heart rate that does not change during inhalation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV is a marker of autonomic flexibility and strong vagal tone, indicating the parasympathetic nervous system can effectively modulate the heart's rhythm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In the context of circadian rhythms, what does a 'blunted' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) usually signify in a clinical neuro-assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal HPA axis function and low stress.",
                "Acute, healthy activation of the sympathetic nervous system.",
                "Chronic stress exhaustion or 'burnout' phase of HPA dysfunction.",
                "High levels of morning melatonin production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 50-75% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A blunted or flat CAR is often associated with chronic fatigue, burnout, and hippocampal atrophy."

            "id": "q7_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Brain Reserve refers to physical structures (size/neurons), Cognitive Reserve refers to the functional efficiency and flexibility of neural circuits developed through life experiences."

            "options": [
                "They increase BDNF levels to protect neurons.",
                "They strengthen the blood-brain barrier to prevent toxin entry.",
                "They can cross the blood-brain barrier and trigger 'sickness behavior,' including lethargy and anhedonia.",
                "They facilitate the conversion of glutamate into GABA."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic peripheral inflammation leads to cytokines crossing into the CNS, which alters neurotransmitter metabolism and promotes depressive-like 'sickness behaviors'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is associated with the dorsal vagal 'shutdown' response, leading to immobilization, numbness, and dissociation."

                "Intense aerobic exercise at 90% Max HR",
                "Resonant frequency breathing at approximately 5.5 to 6 breaths per minute",
                "A high-protein ketogenic diet",
                "Extended periods of sensory deprivation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow, rhythmic breathing at the resonant frequency (around 0.1 Hz) maximizes the oscillation between sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, significantly boosting HRV."
