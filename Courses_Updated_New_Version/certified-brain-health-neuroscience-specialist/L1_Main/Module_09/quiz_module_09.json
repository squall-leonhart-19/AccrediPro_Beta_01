            "question": "Which of the following best distinguishes 'Brain Reserve' from 'Cognitive Reserve' according to the Neuro-Assessment lesson?",
            "options": [
                "Brain Reserve refers to the functional efficiency of networks, while Cognitive Reserve refers to synaptic density.",
                "Brain Reserve is a structural measure (e.g., brain volume, neuron count), while Cognitive Reserve is a functional measure (e.g., adaptability, problem-solving strategies).",
                "Cognitive Reserve is fixed at birth, whereas Brain Reserve can be increased through late-life learning.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms refer to the brain's ability to resist pathology through metabolic rate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brain Reserve is quantitative/structural (the 'hardware'), whereas Cognitive Reserve is the brain's ability to optimize performance through differential recruitment of networks (the 'software')."

            "question": "A client presents with the Val66Met polymorphism. Based on the lesson on BDNF, how does this genetic variation typically affect brain plasticity?",
            "options": [
                "It results in a 25-30% reduction in the activity-dependent secretion of BDNF.",
                "It causes a 50% increase in BDNF production, leading to excitotoxicity.",
                "It prevents the brain from utilizing Omega-3 fatty acids for myelin repair.",
                "It has no effect on BDNF but significantly increases cortisol sensitivity in the amygdala."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Val66Met polymorphism is a common genetic variant that reduces the activity-dependent release of BDNF, which can impact memory and learning efficiency."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Uncoupling Maladaptive Neural Pathways,' what is the primary mechanism of Long-Term Depression (LTD)?",
            "options": [
                "The rapid increase of AMPA receptors at the postsynaptic membrane.",
                "The permanent death of neurons involved in a negative habit circuit.",
                "The internalization (removal) of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane via low-frequency stimulation.",
                "The insulation of axons with thicker myelin to slow down signal transmission."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LTD is the functional opposite of LTP; it involves the removal of AMPA receptors, which weakens the synaptic connection and allows for the 'unwiring' of maladaptive pathways."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "According to Hebbian Learning principles, why is the NMDA receptor considered a 'coincidence detector'?",
            "options": [
                "It only opens when it detects both glutamate binding and a sufficient change in postsynaptic voltage.",
                "It detects the coincidence of high blood sugar and low oxygen levels.",
                "It fires only when the amygdala and prefrontal cortex are active at the exact same time.",
                "It monitors the coincidence of BDNF secretion and sleep cycles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The NMDA receptor requires both the presence of the neurotransmitter (glutamate) and a depolarized membrane (to remove the magnesium plug) to open, signaling that two neurons are firing together."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "During which stage of sleep is the Glymphatic System most active in clearing metabolic waste like Amyloid-beta?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that the glymphatic system—the brain's waste removal pathway—is up to 60% more active during deep N3 Slow Wave Sleep than during wakefulness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While early LTP involves receptor trafficking, late-phase LTP requires gene expression and protein synthesis to create permanent structural changes in the synapse."

            "question": "In Neuro-Nutrition, why are Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) often recommended for metabolic brain health?",
            "options": [
                "They are converted into ketones, providing an alternative fuel source that bypasses glucose hypometabolism.",
                "They block the absorption of all carbohydrates in the small intestine.",
                "They act as a direct replacement for the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "MCTs are easily converted by the liver into ketones, which the brain can use as an efficient energy source, especially in states of insulin resistance or cognitive decline."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the N.E.U.R.O.N. Framework, 'E' stands for Environmental Optimization, emphasizing the external factors like sleep and surroundings that influence internal neural health."

            "options": [
                "Small habits require less BDNF than large habits.",
                "Consistent, repeated activation of a small circuit lowers the threshold for LTP, making the behavior eventually automatic.",
                "Micro-habits bypass the prefrontal cortex entirely and go straight to the brainstem.",
                "There is no Hebbian rationale; micro-habits are purely a psychological trick."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hebbian learning suggests that frequent, consistent activation of a specific neural pathway strengthens the synaptic connection (LTP), eventually requiring less conscious effort to fire the circuit."
