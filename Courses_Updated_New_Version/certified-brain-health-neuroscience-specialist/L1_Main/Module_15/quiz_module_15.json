            "question": "According to Robin Dunbar’s 'Social Brain Hypothesis' discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary driver for the evolution of the unusually large human neocortex?",
            "options": [
                "The need to map complex physical environments for foraging",
                "The computational demands of managing complex social group dynamics",
                "The development of fine motor skills for tool manufacturing",
                "The metabolic shift required to process cooked proteins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dunbar’s Social Brain Hypothesis posits that neocortex size correlates with social group size, as managing complex relationships requires significant neural processing power."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 2, mirror neurons located in the premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobule are unique because they fire under which condition?",
            "options": [
                "Only when an individual performs a goal-directed action",
                "Only when an individual observes another person performing an action",
                "When an individual performs an action AND when they observe the same action performed by another",
                "Only when an individual receives a reward for a social interaction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons provide a neural basis for understanding others' actions by activating the same motor circuits in the observer that are active in the doer."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Research on the neurochemistry of trust (Lesson 3) indicates that while Oxytocin is linked to social bonding, Vasopressin is specifically associated with which behavior in mammalian models?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vasopressin plays a critical role in social behavior, particularly in males, where it influences pair-bonding, territoriality, and protective behaviors."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights the work of Naomi Eisenberger regarding 'Social Pain.' Which brain region shows increased activity during social rejection, mirroring the 'affective' (distress) component of physical pain?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1)",
                "Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)",
                "Occipital Lobe",
                "Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dACC is responsible for the 'unpleasantness' or distress of pain; fMRI studies show this region is highly active during social exclusion (the 'Cyberball' task)."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "During a Neuro-Assessment of Social Health (Lesson 5), a coach identifies that a client has high 'Social Breadth' but low 'Social Depth.' What does this typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client has no social contacts whatsoever",
                "The client has many superficial acquaintances but lacks intimate, high-disclosure relationships",
                "The client has a few very intense relationships but no community involvement",
                "The client is suffering from a total loss of mirror neuron function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Breadth refers to the quantity of connections, while Social Depth refers to the quality and intimacy of those connections."

                "Lead to the immediate development of physical aggression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety behaviors (like avoiding eye contact) prevent the individual from learning that the social situation is not actually dangerous, maintaining the anxiety loop."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is a primary neurological difference between 'Empathy' and 'Compassion' training outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Empathy training activates the prefrontal cortex, while compassion training does not",
                "Empathy training can lead to 'empathic distress' and burnout, while compassion training recruits reward-related circuitry like the ventral striatum",
                "Compassion training is only effective in children under the age of 12",
                "There is no measurable difference in brain activity between the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassion training shifts the brain from a 'pain-sharing' state (empathy) to a 'prosocial-motivation' state (compassion), which is more resilient against burnout."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Brain-to-Brain Synchrony' in groups. Hyperscanning studies show that high levels of neural coupling between a speaker and a listener are a predictor of:",
            "options": [
                "Lower levels of intelligence in the listener",
                "Successful communication and better comprehension of the message",

                "A decrease in oxytocin production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural coupling, where the listener's brain activity mirrors the speaker's (with a slight delay), is a hallmark of effective communication and shared understanding."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A 2003 study mentioned in Lesson 4 found that which common over-the-counter medication could actually reduce the 'hurt' feelings associated with social rejection?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Acetaminophen (Tylenol)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because social and physical pain share neural pathways (dACC/Insula), acetaminophen has been shown to reduce the neural and psychological response to social exclusion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin increases social risk-taking and trust by dampening the amygdala's fear response to potential social betrayal."
