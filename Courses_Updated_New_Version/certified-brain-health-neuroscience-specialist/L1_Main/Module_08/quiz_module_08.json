            "question": "During the process of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), what is the primary molecular change that leads to a 'stronger' synaptic connection?",
            "options": [
                "The insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane",
                "The permanent closure of NMDA receptor channels",
                "A decrease in the amount of glutamate released by the presynaptic neuron",
                "The pruning of the axon terminal to focus energy on the soma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "LTP strengthens synapses primarily by increasing the density of AMPA receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, making the neuron more sensitive to future glutamate release."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "Synaptic pruning is often misunderstood as 'brain loss.' In the context of cognitive efficiency, what is the actual benefit of pruning during adolescence?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the total volume of gray matter to store more data",
                "It reduces metabolic demand by removing redundant or 'noisy' neural pathways",
                "It prevents the brain from forming new memories to protect old ones",
                "It allows the brain to switch from using glucose to using ketones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pruning is a refinement process that removes weak or redundant connections, which reduces neural 'noise' and improves the metabolic efficiency of the remaining circuits."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Myelination is the 'infrastructure' of cognitive speed. By what factor can a fully myelinated axon increase the speed of an action potential compared to an unmyelinated one?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 2 to 5 times faster",
                "Exactly 10 times faster",
                "Up to 100 times faster",
                "Myelination does not change speed, only signal clarity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Myelination allows for saltatory conduction, which can increase the speed of neural transmission by up to 100 times compared to unmyelinated fibers."

            "options": [
                "Synergistic (both active at high levels simultaneously)",
                "Anti-correlated (as one activates, the other should deactivate)",
                "Sequential (the DMN must always fire before the TPN)",
                "Redundant (they perform the same tasks using different pathways)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Healthy cognitive function is characterized by an anti-correlated relationship where the brain can efficiently toggle between internal reflection (DMN) and external task-execution (TPN)."

            "options": [
                "Pro-inflammatory genes are downregulated to save energy",
                "The brain enters a state of 'neural hibernation' with zero inflammation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural circuits that are not regularly used undergo LTD (weakening of the synapse) and are eventually targeted for pruning to maintain the brain's efficiency."
