            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which protein is often referred to as 'miracle-grow for the brain' because it supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth of new synapses?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)",

                "Glutamate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a key neurotrophin that promotes neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and the survival of neurons, making it the primary 'engine' of structural plasticity."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter serves as the primary 'gating mechanism' for plasticity, signaling the brain to encode information during periods of focused attention?",
            "options": [
                "Acetylcholine",
                "GABA",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Acetylcholine, released from the Nucleus Basalis, acts as a neuromodulator that marks specific neural circuits for change during focused attention."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client continues to feel intense 'phantom' pain in a limb that was amputated years ago. In the context of the 'Plasticity Paradox,' this is an example of:",

                "Cognitive Reserve"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maladaptive plasticity occurs when the brain rewires itself in a way that leads to negative symptoms, such as chronic pain or focal dystonia, rather than functional improvement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to Hebbian Theory, what is the fundamental mechanism behind synaptic strengthening?",

                "Information is stored only in the pre-frontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hebbian Theory posits that persistent and simultaneous activity between a presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron leads to an increase in synaptic efficacy (wiring together)."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Brain Reserve' and 'Cognitive Reserve'?",
            "options": [
                "Brain Reserve is about software; Cognitive Reserve is about hardware",
                "Brain Reserve refers to physical structures (size/neuron count); Cognitive Reserve refers to the efficiency of neural networks",
                "They are identical terms used interchangeably in neuroscience",
                "Cognitive Reserve is only found in children, while Brain Reserve is only found in adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brain Reserve is a quantitative measure (hardware), whereas Cognitive Reserve is a functional measure of how flexibly and efficiently the brain uses its available resources (software)."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In the context of 'Sensitive Periods,' why is it generally harder for an adult to learn a second language with native-like proficiency compared to a child?",
            "options": [
                "Adults have no BDNF production",
                "Adult brains have higher levels of inhibitory GABA and physical 'brakes' like perineuronal nets (PNNs)",
                "Adults lack a Nucleus Basalis",
                "The adult brain has completely stopped all forms of synaptogenesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As the brain matures, 'molecular brakes' like PNNs and increased GABAergic inhibition stabilize circuits, making them less susceptible to the rapid change seen in early childhood sensitive periods."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which principle of neuroplasticity suggests that the 'importance' or 'meaning' of a task to the individual influences the degree of cortical remapping?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Salience refers to the relevance of the activity. If a task is meaningful or carries emotional weight, the brain is more likely to release the neurochemicals required for lasting plastic change."

            "id": "q2_8",

                "A temporary increase in neurotransmitter release during a single study session",
                "The physical growth of new dendritic spines and increased gray matter density in the hippocampus",
                "A person feeling more alert after drinking a cup of coffee"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Structural plasticity involves physical changes to the brain's anatomy, such as the growth of new connections or changes in gray matter volume."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "When designing a 'Neuro-Centric' goal for a client, which 'Rule of Plasticity' suggests that the training must be intense enough to trigger a change but not so intense that it causes burnout?",

                "Repetition Matters",
                "Intensity Matters",
                "Specificity Matters",
                "Time Matters"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Intensity Matters' principle states that a certain threshold of stimulation is required to induce plasticity; low-intensity tasks often fail to trigger the necessary biochemical cascades."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that 'Aerobic Exercise' increases BDNF levels. What is the recommended 'minimum effective dose' usually cited to prime the brain for plasticity before a cognitive task?",
            "options": [
                "2 minutes of stretching",
                "20-30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity",

                "Exercise has no effect on BDNF levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that 20-30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise creates a 'window of opportunity' by elevating BDNF levels, making the brain more receptive to learning."
