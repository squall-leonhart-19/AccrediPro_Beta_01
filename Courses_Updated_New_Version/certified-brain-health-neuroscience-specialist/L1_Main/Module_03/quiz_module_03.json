            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which neurobiological principle explains why maladaptive loops become increasingly 'locked in' over time despite the individual's desire to change?",
            "options": [
                "Hebbian Plasticity (LTP): Neurons that fire together, wire together",
                "Synaptic Pruning: The elimination of unused neural connections",
                "Neurogenesis: The creation of new neurons in the hippocampus",
                "Myelination: The insulation of axons to speed up signal transmission"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Maladaptive loops are driven by Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), where repetitive firing strengthens the synaptic connection, making the habit more automated and resistant to change."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'The Biology of Forgetting,' what is the primary cellular mechanism of Long-Term Depression (LTD)?",
            "options": [
                "The addition of NMDA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane",
                "The internalization (removal) of AMPA receptors from the synapse",
                "An increase in glutamate release from the presynaptic neuron",
                "The rapid growth of dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LTD is the process of weakening synaptic connections, primarily achieved through the internalization of AMPA receptors, which reduces the neuron's sensitivity to future stimuli."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "When a client experiences a 'Sensory Anchor' that triggers a craving or habit, the signal often bypasses the cortex. This 'Low Road' pathway travels directly from the Thalamus to which structure?",
            "options": [
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Nucleus Accumbens",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Low Road' is a fast, subconscious survival pathway that sends sensory information from the Thalamus directly to the Amygdala, triggering a response before the conscious brain (Cortex) can process it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A coach introduces a 'Pattern Interrupt' by asking a client to perform a complex mental math problem the moment they feel a trigger. Why is this effective?",
            "options": [
                "It increases cortisol levels to heighten awareness",
                "It activates the Default Mode Network (DMN)",
                "It creates a 'Cognitive Decoupling' by forcing blood flow to the Prefrontal Cortex",
                "It strengthens the Dorsolateral Striatum's habit control"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pattern interrupts work by shifting neural activity from the automated striatal pathways to the Prefrontal Cortex, disrupting the 'autopilot' and creating a window for conscious choice."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Which specific region of the brain is often referred to as the 'Prefrontal Brake' for its role in motor and cognitive inhibition?",
            "options": [
                "The Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (rIFG)",

                "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (rIFG), part of the Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex, is the primary hub for 'Top-Down' inhibition, allowing us to stop an impulsive action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Research on the 'Stress-Habit Cycle' indicates that chronic cortisol exposure leads to which structural change in the brain?",
            "options": [
                "Atrophy in the Striatum and hypertrophy in the PFC",

                "Increased density in the Frontopolar Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress causes the PFC (the 'brake') to shrink and the Dorsolateral Striatum (the 'habit center') to grow, making individuals more prone to habit-based behaviors and less able to use goal-directed logic."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Metacognition, or the 'Observer Brain,' requires a shift in neural activity. Which transition best describes this process during a coaching session?",

                "Decreasing activity in the Frontopolar Cortex (BA 10)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metacognition involves moving away from the DMN (mind-wandering/rumination) toward the TPN (focused awareness and executive function), allowing the client to observe their thoughts objectively."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "According to meta-analyses (e.g., Gollwitzer & Sheeran), 'Implementation Intentions' (If-Then planning) have what level of impact on behavior change?",
            "options": [
                "A negligible effect (d=0.10)",
                "A small effect (d=0.25)",
                "A medium-to-large effect (d=0.65)",
                "Only effective in 5% of the population"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions have a strong evidence base, showing a medium-to-large effect size (d=0.65) in helping bridge the 'Intention-Behavior Gap' by automating the 'Uncoupling' process."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When designing an intervention for a client with a high-stress 'Maladaptive Loop,' which of the following should be the FIRST step in the Uncoupling process?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate cold-turkey cessation of the habit",
                "Mapping the 'Micro-Moments' and sensory cues that precede the loop",
                "Prescribing high-intensity aerobic exercise",
                "Using negative reinforcement to punish the behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Uncoupling begins with awareness. Mapping the 'Micro-Moments' allows the client to identify the sensory anchors and early-stage triggers before the loop becomes fully automated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A client reports they always reach for a sugary snack at 3:00 PM while sitting at their desk. This is an example of a 'Context-Dependent' habit. Which uncoupling strategy targets this specific 'Sensory Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "Metacognitive Labeling",
                "Environment Redesign (Changing the physical cues)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environment Redesign targets the sensory anchors (the desk, the time, the availability of the snack) to disrupt the cue-response association that drives the habit loop."
