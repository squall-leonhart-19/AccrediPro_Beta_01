            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Chronic neuro-inflammation is characterized by the 'priming' of microglia. When primed, microglia shift toward which phenotype, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-1β?",

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "During Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), what must happen to the NMDA receptor to allow the influx of calcium (Ca2+) ions, which is the critical trigger for synaptic strengthening?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LTP is 'voltage-dependent' because the NMDA receptor is blocked by magnesium; only sufficient depolarization can expel the magnesium plug to allow calcium entry."
