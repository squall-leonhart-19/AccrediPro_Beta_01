            "question": "What is the primary role of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in the 'Molecular Architecture of Change' discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a neuroinhibitor to slow down synaptic firing",
                "It serves as a 'fertilizer' that promotes the growth, survival, and differentiation of neurons and synapses",
                "It is the primary neurotransmitter responsible for the 'fight or flight' response",
                "It prevents the formation of new myelin sheaths to keep the brain flexible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a key neurotrophin that supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses, making it essential for neuroplasticity."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the N.E.U.R.O.N. framework, what characterizes the 'Cognitive Windows' identified during the 'E' (Establish) Phase?",
            "options": [
                "Periods of deep sleep where no learning can occur",
                "Fixed chronological ages after which plasticity is impossible",
                "Optimal physiological and psychological states where the brain is most receptive to synaptic remodeling",
                "The 5-minute window immediately following a high-stress event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive windows are states of 'neuro-readiness'—often characterized by specific neurochemical balances—where the brain is most capable of establishing new neural connections."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Uncoupling Maladaptive Pathways.' Which neurobiological mechanism is primarily responsible for weakening the synaptic strength of these old habits?",
            "options": [
                "Long-Term Depression (LTD)",
                "Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)",
                "Myelination",
                "Upregulation of Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While LTP strengthens connections, Long-Term Depression (LTD) is the process of weakening synaptic efficacy, which is necessary for 'unlearning' or uncoupling maladaptive neural pathways."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "According to modern applications of Hebbian Theory (Lesson 4), how does 'recalibrating circuitry' occur in a coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "By avoiding the new behavior to prevent over-firing",
                "Through the simultaneous activation of pre- and post-synaptic neurons via consistent, intentional practice",
                "By using negative reinforcement to punish old neural firings",
                "Only through pharmacological intervention to force neural bonding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hebbian Theory ('cells that fire together, wire together') suggests that consistent, simultaneous activation of neurons through practice leads to increased synaptic strength and recalibrated circuitry."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 distinguishes between Brain Reserve and Cognitive Reserve. What defines 'Cognitive Reserve'?",

                "The physical volume of the brain and the total number of neurons",
                "The thickness of the skull protecting the brain",
                "The brain's ability to use alternative neural networks and functional processes to maintain performance despite pathology",
                "The amount of glucose stored in the glial cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Reserve is a functional concept referring to the brain's resilience and its ability to recruit compensatory networks to maintain function even when structural damage is present."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "When measuring 'Baseline Drift' in the 'N' (Notify/Notice) Phase of assessment (Lesson 6), what is the practitioner evaluating?",
            "options": [
                "The client's ability to drift into a meditative state",
                "The degree to which a client's 'default' neurological and behavioral state has shifted away from the initial baseline",
                "The speed at which a client forgets new information",
                "The physical movement of the brain within the cranium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Baseline Drift refers to the measurable shift in a client’s default state (emotional, cognitive, or behavioral) over time, indicating that neuroplastic changes are becoming the 'new normal.'"

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 describes Dopaminergic Dynamics as the 'fuel' for plasticity. What role does a 'Positive Prediction Error' play in this process?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a drop in dopamine, signaling the brain to stop learning",
                "It creates a dopamine spike when a reward is better than expected, signaling the brain to prioritize and encode the preceding behavior",
                "It causes the brain to ignore new information to save energy",
                "It triggers the release of adrenaline, which halts neuroplasticity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Positive Prediction Error occurs when an outcome is better than expected, triggering a dopamine release that reinforces the neural pathways associated with that successful behavior."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the 'Integrated Network Mastery' (Lesson 8), why is 'synthesis' across different brain networks (like the DMN and CEN) crucial for transformation?",
            "options": [
                "Because change only happens in the Default Mode Network (DMN)",
                "To ensure that new insights (CEN) are integrated into the client's internal sense of self and automatic processing (DMN)",
                "To prevent the brain from using too much oxygen",
                "To ensure the client remains in a state of constant 'Notice' without taking action"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True behavioral transformation requires the integration of new, conscious goals (Central Executive Network) with the internal, self-referential default states (Default Mode Network) for lasting change."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client has a high 'Brain Reserve' but low 'Cognitive Reserve.' Based on Lesson 5, what is their likely presentation?",
            "options": [
                "They have a large brain volume but lack the mental flexibility to adapt to new cognitive challenges",
                "They have a very small brain but are highly intelligent",
                "They have high levels of BDNF but no dopamine",
                "They are unable to form any new memories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Brain Reserve is structural (volume/neurons), while Cognitive Reserve is functional (flexibility/efficiency). High structural reserve without functional efficiency results in a lack of adaptability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "According to the module, why is the 'Uncoupling' phase (Lesson 3) often the most difficult for clients in behavioral transformation?",
            "options": [
                "Because the brain lacks the energy to unlearn",
                "Because existing maladaptive pathways are often myelinated and structurally reinforced, requiring active LTD to weaken",
                "Because unlearning requires the total destruction of neurons",
                "Because the brain can only learn one thing at a time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Old habits are often 'hard-wired' through myelination and strong synaptic coupling; uncoupling them is difficult because it requires active, consistent suppression and the biological process of LTD."
