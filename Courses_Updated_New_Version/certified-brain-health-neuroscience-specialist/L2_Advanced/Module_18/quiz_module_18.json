            "options": [
                "Nutrition (N)",
                "Optimization (O)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Network' component of the N.E.U.R.O.N. Framework™ focuses on social-emotional landscapes, oxytocin production, and the mitigation of neuro-inflammatory markers through healthy community and relational safety."

            "question": "During an Advanced Multimodal Neuro-Assessment (L2), a practitioner observes a 'Low-Frequency' dominant HRV pattern and a suppressed Salience Network (SN) on a functional map. This profile most likely suggests:",
            "options": [
                "Superior executive function and cognitive flexibility",
                "Chronic sympathetic dominance and difficulty switching between internal and external focus",

                "Acute neuro-regeneration following a period of high plasticity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low HRV combined with a suppressed Salience Network typically indicates an inability to effectively switch between the Default Mode Network (internal) and Central Executive Network (external), characteristic of chronic stress or burnout."

            "options": [
                "To increase the total number of neurons in the prefrontal cortex",
                "To isolate the specific region where maladaptive signaling prevents network-wide optimization",
                "To measure the exact milligram dosage of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft",
                "To replace the client's Default Mode Network with a new 'Identity Network'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plasticity mapping identifies 'Neural Bottlenecks'—specific nodes or pathways where maladaptive signaling or lack of connectivity prevents the rest of the brain's networks from functioning efficiently."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Uncoupling involves the simultaneous inhibition of the survival response (limbic) and activation of the cognitive response (PFC) to break the automated 'trigger-response' association."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that BDNF levels are highest immediately following exercise, creating a 60-90 minute window where the brain is most receptive to the structural changes required by new cognitive demands."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is a key SCFA that helps regulate microglia activation and strengthens the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, protecting the brain from systemic toxins."

            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "In 'Network Mastery' (L7), why is moving from 'Habit' to 'Identity' considered the pinnacle of neuroplastic change?",
            "options": [
                "Because habits are stored in the cerebellum, but identity is stored in the DNA",
                "Because identity-based change recruits the Default Mode Network to view the new behavior as 'self-referential,' reducing the cognitive load of willpower",
                "Because identity change requires 10,000 hours of practice, whereas habits take 21 days",
                "Because habits are purely electrical, while identity is purely chemical"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a behavior becomes part of a person's identity, the DMN incorporates it into the 'self-narrative,' which reduces the metabolic cost and 'friction' associated with performing the behavior."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that 'Synergized Protocols' (combining multiple N.E.U.R.O.N. pillars) can result in what percentage increase in cognitive retention compared to single-intervention approaches?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module cites data showing that multimodal 'synergized' protocols offer a significantly higher effect size (approx. 35% improvement) than isolated interventions like diet or exercise alone."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "When conceptualizing a final plan for a client with high 'Allostatic Load' (L8), which pillar should usually be prioritized first to ensure the brain has the resources for plasticity?",

                "Optimization (High-level cognitive training)",

                "Exercise (High-Intensity Interval Training)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In cases of high Allostatic Load (chronic stress/wear and tear), the brain lacks the metabolic energy for growth. Restoration must be prioritized to stabilize the system before demanding the 'energy-expensive' work of plasticity."

            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "Which specific brain network is responsible for the 'Aha!' moment during synthesis, where disparate pieces of information are integrated into a cohesive strategy?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis and 'insight' occur when the Salience Network successfully bridges the gap between the DMN's internal processing/memory and the CEN's external application."
