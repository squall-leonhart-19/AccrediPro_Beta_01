            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-essentialism is the tendency to reduce the complexities of human identity, personality, and behavior to the physical functioning of the brain, often leading to a deterministic worldview."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Plasticity Paradox refers to the fact that the brain's malleability is a double-edged sword; it can be used to improve function, but it can also solidify negative patterns if not guided correctly."
