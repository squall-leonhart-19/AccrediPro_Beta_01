            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Uncoupling focuses on disrupting the 'if-then' neural loops (e.g., trigger -> panic) by introducing a novelty or pause that prevents the automatic completion of the circuit."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Environmental Optimization, a 2023 study highlighted that even one night of sleep deprivation can increase amyloid-beta levels by approximately what percentage?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that acute sleep deprivation significantly impairs glymphatic clearance, leading to measurable increases in metabolic waste like amyloid-beta in key memory centers."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hebbian Theory (1949) is the foundation of LTP, stating that persistent stimulation of one cell by another increases the efficiency of that connection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Spacing Effect works because the biochemical processes required for LTP (like protein synthesis) require time to solidify the synaptic changes initiated during training."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-fatigue or a 'plasticity hangover' is often a sign that the intervention successfully challenged the brain's current metabolic limits, triggering a compensatory growth response."
