            "question": "In the case study on Executive Burnout (L1), which physiological change is most closely associated with 'PFC Hypofrontality' and impaired decision-making?",
            "options": [
                "Increased dendritic branching in the hippocampus",
                "Upregulation of GABAergic receptors in the amygdala",
                "Chronic cortisol-induced atrophy of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex",
                "Enhanced connectivity between the PFC and the striatum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic burnout leads to high cortisol levels, which can cause structural changes including the retraction of dendrites and atrophy in the dlPFC, resulting in 'hypofrontality' or reduced executive control."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "During the 'Metabolic Crisis' following a concussion (L2), what is the primary cause of the acute energy deficit in the brain?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden decrease in glutamate release",
                "Potassium efflux and calcium influx forcing ion pumps to work at maximum capacity",
                "Immediate increase in cerebral blood flow causing oxygen toxicity",
                "The rapid buildup of BDNF inhibiting glucose metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The metabolic crisis is characterized by a massive efflux of potassium and influx of calcium, which forces ATP-dependent ion pumps to work overtime, creating a massive demand for energy (glucose) while cerebral blood flow is simultaneously reduced."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A client presents with significant amyloid-beta pathology on a PET scan but shows no clinical signs of cognitive impairment. According to Lesson 3, this is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Neuroplasticity-induced neurogenesis",
                "The 'Super-Ager' Genetic Mutation",
                "Brain Maintenance Theory",
                "Cognitive Reserve"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Reserve refers to the brain's ability to improvise and find alternate ways of getting a job done, allowing an individual to function normally despite having underlying brain pathology."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In the context of Treatment-Resistant Anxiety (L4), 'Limbic Hijack' is neurologically defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The amygdala's ability to bypass the PFC and trigger the HPA axis via the hypothalamus",

                "An over-reliance on the parasympathetic nervous system during social interactions",
                "A deficiency in glutamate within the ventral striatum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Limbic Hijack occurs when the amygdala perceives a threat and triggers an immediate survival response through the hypothalamus, effectively 'short-circuiting' the slower, more rational processing of the Prefrontal Cortex."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Transient Hypofrontality' theory of Flow States (L5), how does the brain achieve peak performance?",
            "options": [
                "By maximizing activity in the Default Mode Network (DMN)",
                "By increasing analytical thinking in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex",
                "By temporarily downregulating the PFC to reduce self-consciousness and 'inner critic' interference",
                "By shifting all processing power to the occipital lobe for visual processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flow states involve 'transient hypofrontality,' where the parts of the brain responsible for self-monitoring and temporal processing (PFC) quiet down, allowing for faster, more fluid, and instinctive action."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the case study for Complex Trauma (L6), a client in a 'Dorsal Vagal' state would most likely exhibit which symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-vigilance, racing heart, and panic",
                "Increased social engagement and empathy",
                "Numbness, dissociation, and 'shutdown' behavior",
                "Extreme focus and high productivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to Polyvagal Theory, the Dorsal Vagal complex is responsible for the 'freeze' or 'faint' response, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and a drop in metabolic activity when a threat is perceived as inescapable."

            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses ADHD as a 'Reward Deficiency Syndrome.' This is primarily linked to:",
            "options": [
                "Excessive serotonin in the synaptic cleft",
                "Lower density of dopamine D2/D3 receptors and reduced tonic dopamine levels",

                "Over-sensitivity of the Task-Positive Network"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD is often characterized by a 'noisy' or under-stimulated dopamine system, where lower receptor density or lower tonic levels of dopamine make it difficult for the brain to find interest in tasks that don't provide immediate, high-intensity feedback."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "What is a defining neuroanatomical feature of 'Super-Agers' compared to typical older adults (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "They maintain the cortical thickness of the anterior cingulate cortex similar to that of young adults",
                "They have significantly larger amygdalas to process emotional data",
                "They show a complete absence of tau protein in the brain",
                "They have a smaller hippocampus but more efficient neural pathways"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research shows that Super-Agers (individuals 80+ with the memory of 50-year-olds) have a thicker anterior cingulate cortex, a region involved in attention and social-emotional processing, compared to their peers."

            "question": "A client recovering from a mild TBI (L2) experiences a second head impact before the first has healed. What is the most dangerous potential outcome?",

                "Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) onset within 24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Second Impact Syndrome (SIS) occurs when a second concussion is sustained before symptoms of an earlier one have subsided, leading to a loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation and potentially fatal brain swelling."

            "question": "In the Advanced Case Study on Elite Performance (L5), the 'Salience Network' is critical because it:",
            "options": [
                "Controls the sleep-wake cycle via melatonin",
                "Acts as a switch to toggle between the Default Mode Network and the Task-Positive Network",

                "Regulates the body's core temperature during exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Salience Network (specifically the anterior insula) acts as a dynamic switch, detecting important external stimuli and internal states to transition the brain from the 'resting' Default Mode Network to the 'focused' Task-Positive Network."
