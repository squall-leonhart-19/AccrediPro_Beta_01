            "question": "When evaluating neuroscience research in Lesson 1, what does a Cohen's d effect size of 0.8 or higher typically indicate in a clinical intervention study?",
            "options": [
                "A small effect with limited practical application",
                "A medium effect that requires further replication",
                "A large effect indicating high clinical significance",
                "A negligible effect that is statistically insignificant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the hierarchy of evidence, Cohen's d measures effect size. 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 is medium, and 0.8 or higher is considered a large effect, suggesting the intervention has substantial clinical impact."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which popular 'neuro-myth' was debunked in Lesson 2 regarding the impact of 'Learning Styles' (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic) on educational outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Matching instruction to a preferred style does not improve learning retention or performance",
                "Kinesthetic learners have a larger motor cortex than visual learners",
                "Visual learners process information 50% faster than auditory learners",
                "Learning styles are only applicable to children, not adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Extensive meta-analyses have shown that 'meshing' instruction to a specific learning style (VAK) does not produce better outcomes; instead, using multi-modal instruction benefits all learners."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, which biomarker is considered a primary 'proxy' for neuroplasticity and is often measured to assess the 'N' (Neuroscience) phase of brain health?",
            "options": [
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)",
                "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)",
                "Salivary Alpha-Amylase",
                "Blood Glucose Levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a key protein that supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses, making it a critical biomarker for neuroplasticity."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the context of synaptogenesis and pruning (Lesson 4), what is the primary purpose of 'synaptic pruning' during adult brain maturation?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce the total number of neurons to save energy",
                "To eliminate weak or unused connections to increase neural efficiency",
                "To prevent the brain from becoming too heavy for the skull",
                "To stop the process of neurogenesis entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pruning is an essential 'use-it-or-lose-it' process where the brain removes inefficient or redundant synaptic connections to streamline neural communication and improve cognitive processing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'uncoupling' maladaptive habit pathways. What is the neurological goal of this intervention in the basal ganglia?",
            "options": [
                "To completely erase the memory of the habit from the hippocampus",
                "To inhibit the prefrontal cortex from communicating with the amygdala",

                "To increase dopamine production in the ventral striatum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Uncoupling focuses on creating a 'micro-pause' between the trigger (cue) and the automatic behavior, allowing the prefrontal cortex to intervene and redirect the neural pathway."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Based on the environmental impact studies in Lesson 6, what is the specific function of the glymphatic system during deep sleep?",
            "options": [
                "The production of new myelin sheaths for axons",

                "The regulation of body temperature via the hypothalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is highly active during sleep, acting as a waste-clearance system that flushes out neurotoxic waste products that accumulate during waking hours."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 explains Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). Which receptor acts as the 'coincidence detector' that allows calcium to enter the neuron, triggering the strengthening of the synapse?",
            "options": [
                "GABA-A Receptor",
                "NMDA Receptor",
                "Dopamine D2 Receptor",
                "Adenosine Receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NMDA receptor is critical for LTP; it only opens when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized and glutamate is present, allowing calcium influx that signals the synapse to strengthen."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A client is interested in using tDCS (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation) for cognitive enhancement. Based on the ethical guidelines in Lesson 8, what is the practitioner's primary responsibility?",

                "To sell the latest tDCS equipment to the client for home use",
                "To guarantee that the technology will increase IQ by at least 10 points",
                "To differentiate between 'neuro-hype' and evidence-based efficacy for specific conditions",
                "To perform the procedure regardless of the client's medical history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical implementation requires practitioners to critically appraise emerging tech, distinguishing between marketing claims (hype) and what the current peer-reviewed research actually supports."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, research on 'Cognitive Load' suggests that multitasking (heavy media multitasking) is associated with which neurological finding?",

                "Improved ability to filter out irrelevant information",
                "Faster switching speeds between complex tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Loh & Kanai, 2014) have found that heavy multitaskers often show reduced grey-matter density in the ACC, which is linked to poorer emotional regulation and diminished attentional control."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Lesson 1 mentions the '17-year gap' in research. What does this statistic represent in the field of neuroscience and medicine?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '17-year gap' is a well-known phenomenon in translational medicine, highlighting the significant delay between a scientific discovery and its widespread implementation in professional practice."
