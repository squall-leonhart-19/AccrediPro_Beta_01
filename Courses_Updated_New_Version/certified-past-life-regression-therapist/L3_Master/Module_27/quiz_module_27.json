            "options": [
                "Identifying the specific past-life injury or trauma that remains 'locked' in the cellular memory",
                "Using deep hypnosis to numb the physical sensations permanently",
                "Focusing exclusively on current-life emotional triggers and ignoring the past",
                "Suggesting the client seek standard physical therapy without regression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic healing in PLRT focuses on the concept of cellular memory, where the body holds onto the energetic imprint of past-life traumas, manifesting as physical pain in the current life."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, why is the 'Death-Scene Narrative' considered the most critical component for resolving irrational phobias?",

                "It proves the client's historical identity for validation purposes",
                "It allows the soul to 'unfreeze' the trauma by witnessing the transition into spirit and realizing the threat is over",
                "It provides the therapist with the names of the people responsible for the death",
                "It is the only way to ensure the client does not experience the same death again"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By processing the death-scene, the client can consciously recognize that the traumatic event has ended, allowing the subconscious to release the 'fight or flight' response associated with the phobia."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Soul contracts are pre-incarnation agreements where souls in a group agree to play specific roles (e.g., antagonist, mentor) to help each other learn specific spiritual lessons."

                "To identify a life where the client was a famous historical figure for ego boosting",
                "To access latent talents, wisdom, or 'genius' states that can be integrated into the current life",
                "To predict the client's future successes and failures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Positive regression focuses on 'resource states'—lives where the client excelled or possessed specific skills—to help them reclaim those abilities in their current incarnation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research, including that of Dr. Ian Stevenson, suggests that children's spontaneous past-life memories are most vivid between ages 2-5 and typically begin to fade between 5-7 as they integrate more into their current personality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Hungry Ghost' archetype often stems from a past life where the individual died with an intense, unfulfilled need or during a period of starvation, creating a 'void' that the current personality tries to fill with substances."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Irrational phobias are most effectively treated by identifying and processing the specific past-life 'Death-Scene Narrative' that matches the current fear triggers."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
