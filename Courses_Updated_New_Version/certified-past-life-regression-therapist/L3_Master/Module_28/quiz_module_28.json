            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "If a client begins to experience traumatic flooding (acute abreaction) during a regression, what is the most appropriate immediate intervention to ensure safety?",
            "options": [
                "Instruct the client to move deeper into the emotion to find the root cause.",
                "Immediately wake the client up using a rapid count-out technique.",
                "Shift the client to the 'Observer Perspective,' moving them to a point high above the scene.",
                "Ask the client to describe the physical sensations in minute detail to ground them."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing an 'Observer Perspective' (dissociation for safety) is the primary tool for managing flooding, allowing the client to process the event without being overwhelmed by the sensory re-experiencing."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "When a client reports a non-human or 'archetypal' incarnation, such as an elemental or extraterrestrial being, what does Lesson 2 suggest is the therapist's most effective approach?",
            "options": [
                "Gently challenge the reality of the memory to return the client to human history.",
                "Treat the narrative as a valid subjective experience and explore its symbolic or energetic relevance.",
                "Refer the client to a psychiatric specialist for potential delusional ideation.",
                "Ignore the non-human aspects and focus only on the human emotions involved."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In advanced regression, the literal truth of the incarnation is less important than the symbolic or energetic 'charge' it holds for the client's current soul growth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "What is the defining characteristic of a 'Complex Karmic Loop' as described in Lesson 3?",

                "A single traumatic event that causes a phobia in the current life.",
                "A recurring pattern of behavior or relationship dynamics that repeats across multiple incarnations without resolution.",
                "A memory of being a perpetrator in a historical war.",
                "The inability to see any images during a regression session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Karmic loops are characterized by their repetitive, compulsive nature across many lifetimes, often requiring a 'systemic' view to break the cycle."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client consistently experiences 'subconscious sabotage' (Lesson 4), such as falling asleep or losing the image right before a critical realization. This is often caused by:",
            "options": [
                "A lack of hypnotic depth (low trance state).",
                "A 'Protector Part' of the psyche fearing that the truth will be too destabilizing.",
                "The client's lack of imagination or creative ability.",
                "The therapist using the wrong induction script."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance is usually a protective mechanism. 'Protector parts' intervene when they perceive that the upcoming material might exceed the client's current capacity to cope."

            "id": "q28_5",

            "options": [
                "The amount of time a client can stay in a trance before becoming restless.",
                "The range of arousal in which a client can process trauma without becoming hyper-aroused or hypo-aroused.",

                "The period of time between the regression and the integration session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal zone for therapeutic work. If a client moves outside this window (into flooding or numbing), processing stops and re-traumatization can occur."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "According to Stanislav Grof's criteria mentioned in Lesson 6, how does a 'Spiritual Emergency' differ from a traditional psychotic break?",

                "Psychotic breaks only happen to younger individuals.",
                "In a spiritual emergency, the individual typically maintains a degree of self-reflection and the ability to cooperate with a therapist.",
                "Spiritual emergencies always resolve within 24 hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'observing ego' remains somewhat intact in a spiritual emergency, allowing the individual to relate their experience to a therapist, whereas in psychosis, that self-reflective capacity is usually lost."

                "To prove that time is linear and the experience is a fantasy.",
                "To sever the connection between the two timelines permanently.",
                "To resolve the emotional 'bleed-through' by addressing the shared trauma or lesson in both timelines.",
                "To ignore the parallel life and focus only on the past lives."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Quantum interference suggests that unresolved issues in a 'parallel' existence are impacting the current life; resolution involves acknowledging and healing the shared energetic theme."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a symptom of 'Vicarious Trauma' (Lesson 8) that a regression therapist might experience after working with complex cases?",
            "options": [
                "An increased sense of spiritual connection and joy.",

                "A decrease in the need for supervision."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious trauma involves a fundamental shift in the therapist's internal schema, often resulting in symptoms similar to PTSD after being exposed to the client's traumatic narratives."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client discovers they are carrying a 'vow of poverty' taken by an ancestor three generations ago. According to Lesson 3, this is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "A personal karmic debt.",
                "An ancestral entanglement.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ancestral entanglements occur when a client carries burdens, vows, or traumas that originated with a biological or spiritual ancestor rather than their own previous incarnation."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "What is 'Titration' in the context of advanced regression for complex trauma (Lesson 5)?",

                "The use of specific essential oils to deepen the trance.",
                "A method of measuring the client's heart rate during a session.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is a key trauma-informed principle that involves processing trauma in 'small drips' rather than diving into the full intensity of the event all at once."
