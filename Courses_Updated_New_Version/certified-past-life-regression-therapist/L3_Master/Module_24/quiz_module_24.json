            "options": [
                "To bypass the conscious mind using rapid, high-pressure induction scripts",
                "To access and vibrate somatic memories stored within the physical body's energetic field and cellular structure",
                "To induce a state of complete amnesia regarding the session to prevent ego-interference",
                "To visualize external spirit guides before allowing the client to feel any physical sensations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cellular Resonance focuses on the body as a living archive, using physical sensations as a 'bridge' to access deep-seated memories stored at the cellular level."

            "options": [
                "Through a purely emotional, first-person immersion where they re-experience trauma fully",
                "By adopting an analytical, judgmental perspective to critique their past actions",
                "From a non-attached, multidimensional awareness that observes the narrative without ego-driven judgment",
                "Through a third-person perspective that intentionally ignores all physical and somatic feedback"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Witness Protocol facilitates a 'meta-perspective,' allowing the client to observe the life's lessons and patterns without being overwhelmed by the ego's emotional reactions."

                "To transmute the stagnant energy of past trauma into wisdom and functional life patterns in the present",
                "To identify who is 'at fault' in the past life and ensure the client feels vindicated",
                "To transfer the karmic debt to a future incarnation to provide immediate relief in this life"

                "To demand the client explain the logic of the release while it is physically occurring",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Master Practitioner holds the space for the body to complete its 'thaw' or release, ensuring safety and grounding without interrupting the natural cathartic process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is the bridge between the trance state and reality; it requires turning the 'wisdom' found in regression into practical, lived changes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance is often a protective mechanism. Negotiating with the 'Protector' honors the client's psyche and usually allows for a safer, deeper progression."

                "Discourage the client from seeing any specific historical details to avoid 'false memories'",
                "Use leading questions to guide the client toward a verifiable historical event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ethical focus is on the client's healing and the 'psychological truth' of the experience, rather than acting as a historical researcher or guaranteeing literal accuracy."

                "A somatic marker acting as a gateway to a cellular memory of a specific trauma",
                "A sign that the client is having a physical heart attack and needs immediate medical intervention",
                "An ego-block designed to distract the practitioner from the real issue",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In Master Practitioner skills, sudden localized sensations (somatic markers) are seen as 'access points' or 'gateways' into the cellular memory of the past-life event."

            "options": [
                "It only focuses on the physical sensations of the past-life body",
                "It involves tracking the physical, emotional, and soul-level significance of an event simultaneously",
                "It requires the practitioner to use at least three different induction scripts at once",
                "It limits the session to only the 'death scene' of the past life"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multidimensional observation tracks the 'whole' experience—the event, the feeling, and the 'why' (the soul lesson)—to provide a comprehensive healing experience."
