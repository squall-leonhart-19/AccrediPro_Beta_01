            "id": "q34_1",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1, what does the 'Group Field' effect primarily refer to in a Past Life Regression setting?",
            "options": [
                "The physical layout of the room and the arrangement of yoga mats or chairs.",
                "The phenomenon where the collective energy and intention of the group accelerate the depth of trance for individual members.",
                "A specific marketing strategy used to fill workshops by targeting 'fields' of interest.",
                "The legal boundaries and liability waivers required for group therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Group Field effect is a core dynamic where the combined focus and subconscious resonance of the participants create a 'container' that often allows individuals to enter deeper states of trance more quickly than in solo sessions."

        {
            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When designing a high-impact retreat (Lesson 2), why is the 'Arc of Transformation' essential for participant safety?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures that the most expensive activities are scheduled for the final day.",
                "It provides a structured descent into deep subconscious work followed by a deliberate 're-entry' and grounding phase.",
                "It is a legal requirement for insurance purposes in most jurisdictions.",
                "It allows the facilitator to skip the individual intake process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Arc of Transformation ensures that participants are not left in an 'open' or vulnerable state; it prioritizes psychological safety by sandwiching deep regression between preparation and thorough integration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Group Somatic Induction (S), which technique is most effective for synchronizing the breathing patterns of 20+ participants?",
            "options": [
                "Individualized breathwork coaching for each person.",
                "Using a rhythmic, low-frequency metronome or drum beat at 60-70 BPM.",
                "Entrainment through the facilitator’s own audible, rhythmic breathing and pacing.",
                "Playing loud, high-tempo music to mask individual variations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In group settings, the facilitator acts as the 'pacer.' By consciously modulating their own breath and vocal cadence, the group naturally entrains to that rhythm, creating a unified somatic state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "During the 'Objective Observation' (O) phase of a group narrative (Lesson 4), how should the facilitator handle participants who report 'nothing is happening'?",
            "options": [
                "Ask them to leave the room to avoid disturbing others.",
                "Direct them to 'make it up' or use creative imagination to bypass the analytical block.",
                "Immediately stop the group session to focus on that one individual.",
                "Tell them they are likely not ready for regression and should try again in a year."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 teaches that 'imagination is the gateway.' By encouraging a participant to simply 'make up' a story, the analytical mind relaxes, often allowing genuine subconscious material to surface through the imagined narrative."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Emotional Contagion' is identified as a risk during Group Catharsis (C). How is this best managed?",
            "options": [
                "By ensuring all participants are wearing noise-canceling headphones.",
                "By establishing 'Somatic Anchors' early in the session to help participants stay centered in their own experience.",
                "By prohibiting any vocalization or crying during the regression.",
                "By only allowing one person to experience catharsis at a time while others watch."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchors (like touching a specific finger to the thumb) provide a physical 'reset' button, allowing participants to witness others' catharsis without becoming overwhelmed by the group's collective emotional release."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 emphasizes 'Group Integration' (E). What is the primary benefit of using 'Dyad Processing' after a collective regression?",
            "options": [
                "It reduces the workload for the lead facilitator.",
                "It allows participants to 'clear' the narrative by verbalizing it to a witness, which aids in cognitive grounding.",
                "It is used to sell future one-on-one sessions to the partners.",
                "It ensures that no one leaves the room without paying their final balance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Verbalizing the experience to a peer (Dyad) helps move the material from the right-brain (experiential/image-based) to the left-brain (logical/linguistic), which is crucial for long-term integration and resolution."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "If a participant experiences a severe abreaction (intense emotional distress) during a group session (Lesson 7), what is the facilitator's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "To wake up the entire group immediately to help the individual.",
                "To ignore the individual so the rest of the group isn't distracted.",
                "To use a 'split-focus' technique: maintain the group's trance with a calm voice while providing a grounding touch or directive to the individual.",
                "To call emergency services immediately before attempting to calm the person."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Expert facilitation involves holding the 'container' for the group while simultaneously addressing the individual. A calm, directive voice can guide the individual to a 'safe place' in their mind without breaking the trance of the other participants."

        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the 'Value Ladder' strategy for scaling a PLR business?",

                "Charging more for sessions held on higher floors of a building.",
                "Starting with low-cost introductory webinars, leading to workshops, and eventually high-ticket retreats or certifications.",
                "Increasing prices by 10% every month regardless of demand.",
                "Only offering one expensive service to ensure exclusivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Value Ladder allows a practitioner to reach a wider audience at different price points, building trust and 'ascending' clients into deeper, more transformative (and higher-priced) group programs."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "In a 2022 study cited in the module, group-based regression sessions showed what percentage of efficacy compared to individual sessions for 'general life purpose' clarity?",
            "options": [
                "Only 25%, suggesting groups are mostly for entertainment.",
                "Approximately 85%, indicating that for non-clinical issues, groups are highly effective.",
                "100%—they were found to be identical in every measurable way.",
                "Groups were found to be more dangerous and were not recommended."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that for general self-discovery and life-purpose work, group sessions offer high efficacy (approx. 85%) while being significantly more accessible and cost-effective for the client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "What is the 'R' in the SOURCE model as applied to group karma resolution (Lesson 5)?",

                "Resolution: Reframing the past life event to release the 'Karmic Knot' or contract.",

                "Resistance: Identifying which participants are fighting the process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resolution is the stage where the 'lesson' of the past life is extracted and the old contract is released, ensuring the participant doesn't just 'relive' the trauma but actually resolves it."
