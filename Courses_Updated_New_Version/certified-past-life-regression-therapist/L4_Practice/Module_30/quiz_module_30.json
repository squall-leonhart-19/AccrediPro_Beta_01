                "I can diagnose spiritual ailments that doctors often miss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Legal compliance requires clear boundaries; practitioners must explicitly state that PLRT is not a substitute for professional medical or psychiatric treatment to avoid legal liability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active psychosis and severe dissociative disorders are primary contraindications for PLRT. Ethical practice requires declining the case and referring to a clinical professional."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Per-session pricing commoditizes the service. High-ticket packages should be priced based on the total transformation and outcome, not the hours spent in the chair."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical storytelling requires changing all identifying markers (name, city, specific career details) so the client cannot be identified by the public, even if they recognize their own story."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because PLRT is emotionally and energetically demanding, most practitioners reach a 'Threshold of Exhaustion' at 15-20 deep regressions per week, necessitating a move to group models or higher pricing."
