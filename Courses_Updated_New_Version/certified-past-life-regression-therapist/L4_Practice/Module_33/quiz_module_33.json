            "question": "A client presents with chronic migraines and believes they are related to a past-life head injury. According to the 'Scope of Practice' guidelines (L1), which response is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Confirm that the past life is the definitive cause of the physical migraine.",
                "Advise the client to stop their current medication as the regression will heal the root cause.",
                "Facilitate the regression while clearly stating you do not diagnose or treat medical conditions.",
                "Tell the client that regression is a substitute for a neurological consultation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must operate within their scope, which excludes diagnosing or treating medical conditions. Facilitating the session as an experimental/spiritual modality while deferring to medical professionals is the legal standard."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent must clarify the nature of the service. Defining PLR as an 'experimental spiritual modality' helps distinguish it from regulated clinical psychology or medicine."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional Liability (Malpractice/Errors & Omissions) protects against claims of 'bad advice' or session-related harm, while General Liability covers physical injury or property damage at the place of business."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A medical disclaimer is a critical risk management tool that explicitly separates the regression work from professional medical/psychiatric care."

            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses the 'Ethics of Karmic Resolution.' If a client becomes highly distressed by a 'false memory' of a violent act, what is the practitioner's ethical duty?",
            "options": [
                "To insist that the memory is 100% historically accurate.",
                "To ignore the distress and move to the next life.",

                "Regression the client back to a life where they felt safer.",
                "Break confidentiality to contact emergency services or a designated crisis contact.",
                "Ask the client to sign a waiver promising not to do it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Duty to Protect' is a legal and ethical exception to confidentiality; if a client is an immediate danger to themselves or others, the practitioner must intervene."
