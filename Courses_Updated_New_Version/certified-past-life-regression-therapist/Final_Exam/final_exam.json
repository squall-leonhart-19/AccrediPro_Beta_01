                "To integrate the past life wisdom into the client's current career goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Induction focuses on bypassing the critical faculty by utilizing the body-mind connection to reach a hypnotic state (typically Alpha or Theta) suitable for regression."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "During the 'Objective Observation' (O) phase, why is it critical for the therapist to encourage a 'neutral observer' perspective?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the client from feeling any physical sensations at all.",
                "To ensure the client does not remember the session afterward.",
                "To establish context and identity without the client becoming prematurely overwhelmed by emotional trauma.",
                "To speed up the session so more lives can be explored in one hour."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective Observation allows the client to gather 'data' (who, where, when) before diving into the emotional narrative, which helps prevent immediate abreaction and ensures a clearer narrative structure."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",

                "The point where the therapist decides to end the induction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pivot Points are the crucial moments in the past life narrative where significant choices were made or traumas occurred, leading to the current life's emotional or spiritual blocks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Karmic Reframing isn't about changing history, but changing the soul's relationship to that history, allowing for the release of 'unfinished business' that affects the present."

                "Leave the room to give the client private space to cry."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the SOURCE framework, Cathartic Release must be managed safely. The therapist acts as a container, ensuring the client processes the energy rather than suppressing it or becoming re-traumatized."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration is the bridge between the subconscious experience and conscious application. Without it, the regression remains a 'spiritual movie' rather than a therapeutic tool."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical PLR practice requires open-ended questions to ensure the narrative emerges from the client's own subconscious rather than being 'implanted' by the therapist's leading prompts."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "In Module 33 (Legal & Compliance), what is a mandatory requirement for a professional PLR practice?",

            "options": [
                "Tell the client to buy a lottery ticket.",

                "Tell the client they are destined to be poor forever."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soul contracts are often made for growth or protection in a previous context. In the SOURCE framework, we uncover these to see if they are still serving the client and facilitate release if they are now restrictive."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation is a key safety tool in the 'O' and 'C' phases to prevent re-traumatization while still allowing the client to witness and process the event."
