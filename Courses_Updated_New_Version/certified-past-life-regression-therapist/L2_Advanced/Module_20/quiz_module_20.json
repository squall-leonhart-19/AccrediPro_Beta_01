            "question": "According to the Pre-Regression Readiness Profile (L1), which of the following is considered a primary 'Red Flag' contraindication for Past Life Regression?",
            "options": [
                "A strong belief in reincarnation or spiritualism",
                "A history of mild generalized anxiety",
                "Active psychosis or a diagnosed dissociative disorder",
                "Skepticism regarding the validity of past lives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active psychosis and dissociative disorders are primary contraindications as they can lead to further fragmentation or the inability to distinguish between the 'observing self' and the 'experiencing self' during regression."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "The Karmic Pattern Inventory (KPI)™ (L2) is primarily used to identify 'Karmic Loops.' What characterizes a Karmic Loop in this assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Recurring emotional reactions or behavioral choices that yield the same negative results across multiple life stages or lifetimes",
                "The specific geographical location where a person was born in a previous life",
                "A list of all the people the client has known in their current life",
                "The chronological sequence of historical events in the client's lineage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Karmic Loops are identified in the KPI™ as repetitive patterns of behavior, emotion, or relationship dynamics that suggest an unresolved lesson or soul contract."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In Somatic Baseline and Resonance Mapping (L3), why is it critical to document the 'Somatic Baseline' before the induction begins?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client is physically comfortable in the chair",
                "To distinguish between pre-existing physical conditions and somatic 'bridges' that emerge during the regression",
                "To calculate the client's body mass index for session duration",
                "To practice the therapist's touch-healing techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing a baseline allows the therapist to differentiate between a client's chronic physical issues (like a sore back from a car accident) and new somatic sensations that arise as a 'bridge' to a past-life memory."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "During the assessment of Hypnotic Depth and Receptivity (L4), the 'Somnambulistic' state is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The client being unable to speak or move",
                "A light state of relaxation where the client is fully aware of the room",
                "The ability to open eyes without breaking trance and experience positive/negative hallucinations",
                "A state of deep sleep where no memory retrieval is possible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The somnambulistic state is the deep level of trance where the subconscious is fully accessible, allowing for vivid sensory recall and the ability to interact with the environment without exiting the state."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "When performing Narrative Integrity and Soul Contract Analysis (L5), what does a 'Binding Contract' typically sound like in the client's narrative?",
            "options": [
                "'I learned that I should be more patient with others.'",
                "'I see a bright light and feel a sense of total forgiveness.'",
                "'I will never love anyone else, for all eternity, no matter what.'",
                "'I feel a heavy weight being lifted from my shoulders.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Binding contracts are identified by absolute, restrictive language such as 'never,' 'always,' or 'forever,' often made during moments of high-impact trauma or emotional intensity."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Measuring Resolving the Karma (R) Effectiveness,' what is the primary indicator of a successful 'Resolution Shift'?",
            "options": [
                "The client provides a specific date and name for the past-life persona",
                "A significant drop in the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs) when the client revisits the traumatic memory after the intervention",
                "The client stays in trance for more than 90 minutes",
                "The therapist feels a 'spiritual presence' in the room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Resolution Shift is measured by the reduction of emotional or physical charge (SUDs) associated with the memory, indicating that the 'karma' or trauma has been processed."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "The Integration Success Scorecard (L7) evaluates 'Functional Alignment.' What does this metric measure?",
            "options": [
                "How well the client's past-life identity matches their current-life career",
                "The degree to which the insights from the regression are being applied to change current-life behaviors and relationships",
                "The client's ability to remember the details of the session without a recording",
                "The physical alignment of the client's spine after somatic release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional Alignment measures the practical application of the regression; the session is only considered successful if it leads to tangible improvements in the client's current life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "According to Ethical Risk Assessment (L8), what is the appropriate action if a client experiences an 'Abreaction' that they cannot move through after repeated grounding attempts?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately end the session and ask them to leave",
                "Increase the depth of the trance to bypass the emotion",
                "Use the 'Bridge Back' technique to return to a safe space and, if necessary, terminate the session and refer to a trauma specialist",
                "Tell the client that their reaction is 'not real' to calm them down"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical standards require the therapist to prioritize client safety; if an abreaction cannot be stabilized, the therapist must safely ground the client and refer to a higher level of clinical care if needed."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "In a case study from L3, a client with chronic unexplainable neck pain showed 'Somatic Resonance' when viewing a specific historical era. What does this suggest to the therapist?",
            "options": [
                "The client has poor posture",
                "The neck pain is a 'Somatic Bridge' likely linked to a traumatic transition (death) or injury in that specific lifetime",
                "The client is imagining the pain to please the therapist",
                "The therapist should refer the client for a neck X-ray immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Resonance occurs when current physical symptoms 'vibrate' or intensify in response to past-life stimuli, indicating a direct link to a previous trauma."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key component of 'Narrative Integrity' (L5) used to distinguish authentic memory from fantasy?",

                "The client describes themselves as a famous historical figure",
                "The presence of 'Multi-Sensory Specificity'—unexpected smells, textures, or peripheral details not central to the main plot",
                "The client's ability to speak a foreign language they have never studied"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Authentic memories often contain 'peripheral' or 'mundane' sensory details that are irrelevant to a 'made-up' story but consistent with how the brain stores actual experiences."
