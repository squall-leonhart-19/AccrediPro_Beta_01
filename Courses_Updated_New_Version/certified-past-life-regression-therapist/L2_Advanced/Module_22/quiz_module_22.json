            "question": "According to the Professional Scope of Practice (L1), what is the most critical boundary a non-clinical Past Life Regression (PLR) therapist must maintain when a client presents with clinical depression?",
            "options": [
                "Attempting to regress the client to the 'root cause' of the depression in a past life.",
                "Explaining that PLR is a spiritual/exploratory tool and referring the client to a licensed mental health professional for clinical treatment.",
                "Using hypnotic suggestions to alleviate the symptoms of depression during the session.",
                "Combining PLR with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques to provide a holistic solution."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must operate within their scope. Non-clinical therapists are not qualified to treat diagnosed mental health disorders and must refer clients to licensed professionals while maintaining the distinction between spiritual exploration and clinical therapy."

        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "In the context of Informed Consent (L2), what must a practitioner disclose regarding the 'historical accuracy' of regression memories?",
            "options": [
                "That all memories recovered in trance are 100% historically verifiable facts.",
                "That the practitioner guarantees the client will see a famous historical figure.",
                "That memories may be a mix of historical fact, metaphor, and subconscious confabulation, and cannot be proven as objective history.",
                "That the practitioner's intuition will determine which parts of the story are true."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical informed consent requires the practitioner to manage expectations by explaining that PLR material is often subjective and may contain symbolic or metaphorical elements rather than literal historical data."

        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'leading question' that violates Narrative Integrity (L3)?",
            "options": [
                "'What do you see when you look at your feet?'",
                "'Notice the environment around you; what is the temperature like?'",
                "'Are you wearing a soldier's uniform from the Civil War?'",
                "'How do you feel in this moment?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leading questions plant specific details (e.g., 'Civil War,' 'soldier') into the client's mind, which can cause confabulation. Ethical practitioners use open-ended questions to allow the client's own narrative to emerge."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A client begins to shake, hyperventilate, and weep uncontrollably during a traumatic past-life scene. According to Trauma-Informed Ethics (L4), what is the first priority?",
            "options": [
                "To push the client to finish the scene so the karma is fully cleared.",
                "To immediately wake the client up by snapping your fingers.",
                "To use 'distancing techniques,' such as asking the client to view the scene from a high balcony or as a black-and-white movie.",
                "To tell the client that the pain is not real and they should ignore it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When an intense abreaction occurs, the therapist should use grounding or distancing techniques to help the client process the emotion without being re-traumatized, ensuring they remain in a 'dual state' of awareness."

        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "The 'Guru Complex' (L5) occurs when a practitioner inadvertently encourages what type of dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "A collaborative partnership where the client makes all their own life decisions.",
                "A dynamic where the client views the therapist as an enlightened authority who has all the answers to their soul's journey.",
                "An environment where the practitioner regularly seeks peer supervision.",
                "A professional relationship strictly defined by a signed contract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Guru Complex involves a power imbalance where the practitioner assumes (or allows the client to project) a role of spiritual infallibility, which undermines the client's personal autonomy and self-healing."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "Under Cultural Competence (L6), how should a practitioner handle a client whose religious beliefs do not include reincarnation but who is curious about PLR?",
            "options": [
                "Try to convert the client to a belief in reincarnation before starting the session.",
                "Refuse to work with the client because their beliefs are incompatible with PLR.",
                "Frame the experience as a 'metaphorical journey' or 'subconscious storytelling' that can provide insight regardless of religious doctrine.",
                "Tell the client that their religion is wrong and provide scientific 'proof' of past lives."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practitioners respect spiritual diversity by adapting the framework of the session to the client's comfort level, often using psychological or metaphorical language for those who don't hold literal beliefs in reincarnation."

        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "According to Data Protection guidelines (L7), when is it ethically permissible to break client confidentiality?",
            "options": [
                "When the practitioner wants to share an interesting case study on social media without changing the name.",
                "When there is a clear and imminent risk of the client harming themselves or someone else.",
                "When the client's spouse calls and asks for details about the session.",
                "When another regression therapist asks for the client's file out of curiosity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Duty to Warn' or 'Duty to Protect' is a standard ethical and legal exception to confidentiality in most jurisdictions when there is a risk of serious harm."

        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "L8 emphasizes 'Practitioner Integrity.' What is the primary purpose of 'Peer Supervision' or 'Intervision' for a PLR therapist?",
            "options": [
                "To find out which other therapists are charging higher rates.",
                "To have a space to process countertransference and ensure personal biases aren't affecting client work.",
                "To form a marketing group to get more clients.",
                "To prove to other therapists that you are more experienced than they are."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peer supervision is vital for self-regulation, helping practitioners recognize when their own 'shadow' or emotional responses (countertransference) might be interfering with the therapeutic process."

        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "Research on 'False Memory Syndrome' (L3) suggests that memory is not like a video recording, but is instead:",
            "options": [
                "A permanent file that never changes over time.",
                "A constructive process that can be influenced by the way questions are phrased.",
                "Only accessible to those with a high IQ.",
                "Always 100% accurate when the person is in a deep theta brainwave state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scientific research shows that memory is 'constructive' and 'reconstructive,' meaning it can be easily altered by external suggestions or the person's current beliefs and emotions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "A client claims they were a high priestess in Atlantis and begins to use this 'memory' to justify leaving their family and avoiding all responsibilities. What is the ethical response for the therapist?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage them to follow their 'soul's truth' and leave their family immediately.",
                "Help the client ground the experience and explore how the 'priestess' archetype can be integrated into their current life responsibly.",
                "Tell the client that Atlantis didn't exist and they are hallucinating.",
                "Charge the client double because they were royalty in a past life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical PLR focuses on 'grounding' the insights into the current life. The therapist should help the client integrate the narrative in a way that promotes functional, healthy behavior rather than escapism or abandonment of duties."
