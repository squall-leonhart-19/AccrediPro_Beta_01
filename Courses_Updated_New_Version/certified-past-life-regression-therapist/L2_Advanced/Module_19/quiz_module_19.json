            "question": "In Dr. Ian Stevenson's 40 years of research at the University of Virginia, what was the primary focus of the 2,500+ cases he documented?",
            "options": [
                "Adults undergoing hypnotic regression for trauma",
                "Spontaneous past-life memories in young children",
                "Mediumistic communications from deceased relatives",
                "Near-death experiences in clinical settings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Stevenson focused almost exclusively on children (usually between ages 2 and 5) who spoke spontaneously about previous lives without the use of hypnosis."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Dr. Jim Tucker developed the 'Strength of Case Scale' (SCCS) to quantify the quality of evidence. Which of the following is NOT one of the primary variables measured by this scale?",
            "options": [
                "The birthmarks or birth defects related to the previous life",
                "The distance between the two families' homes",
                "The number of years the subject has practiced meditation",
                "The specificity of the statements made by the child"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SCCS measures birthmarks/defects, the distance between homes, the specificity of statements, and the presence of 'recognitions' (identifying people/places). Meditation practice is not a factor in the scale."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "When evaluating a case of 'Xenoglossy,' which type is considered the strongest evidence of a past-life influence rather than a cognitive anomaly?",
            "options": [
                "Recitative Xenoglossy (repeating rote phrases/songs)",
                "Glossolalia (speaking in tongues or non-structured sounds)",
                "Responsive Xenoglossy (the ability to converse in a foreign language)",
                "Cryptomnesic Xenoglossy (recalling a language heard in early childhood)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Responsive xenoglossy involves the ability to interact and answer questions in a language the subject has never learned, which is significantly harder to explain via cryptomnesia than merely reciting memorized fragments."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "According to Stevenson’s study of 210 cases of children with birthmarks related to previous-life trauma, what percentage of cases showed a correspondence between the birthmark and an autopsy report or medical record?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 35%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 88%",
                "Approximately 15%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In 88% of the cases where Stevenson could obtain medical records or autopsy reports for the deceased person identified by the child, the birthmarks corresponded precisely with the wounds recorded."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "From a Quantum Perspective, Ervin Laszlo’s theory of the 'Akashic Field' (A-field) suggests that past-life memories are stored where?",
            "options": [
                "Within the individual's DNA sequences",
                "In the synaptic connections of the physical brain",
                "In a non-local informatory field that persists beyond the physical body",
                "In the collective unconscious as archetypal symbols only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Laszlo proposes that the vacuum of space contains a field (the A-field) that records all events and information, allowing for non-local access to memories that are not dependent on physical brain matter."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "In a meta-analysis of clinical outcomes for regression therapy, what is the most commonly reported result regarding psychosomatic symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Symptoms usually worsen before they improve (the 'healing crisis')",
                "A 70-80% significant reduction or total elimination of symptoms after 3-5 sessions",
                "Symptoms remain unchanged but the client's attitude toward them improves",
                "Regression is only effective for psychological issues, not physical ones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical meta-analyses, such as those by Dr. Heather Rivera, consistently show high success rates (70-80%) in symptom resolution when the 'originating trauma' is processed."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark of 'Cryptomnesia,' a common skeptical explanation for past-life recall?",
            "options": [
                "The subject intentionally lies to gain fame or money",
                "A 'hidden memory' from a book, movie, or conversation is mistaken for an original experience",
                "The subject experiences a complete loss of their current identity",
                "Physical changes in the body that mirror the previous personality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cryptomnesia is the 'unconscious plagiarism' of information the subject has encountered in this life (like a novel or TV show) which then resurfaces during hypnosis as if it were a past-life memory."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "When conducting investigative verification of a client's narrative, what is the 'Corroboration Threshold'?",
            "options": [
                "The point where the therapist believes the client's story",
                "The minimum number of historical facts (usually 3-5) that must be verified by independent records",
                "The amount of money required to hire a private investigator",
                "The level of emotional intensity the client displays during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Corroboration Threshold requires finding multiple specific, non-public details in historical records that match the client's spontaneous recall to ensure the narrative isn't based on general historical knowledge."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A therapist uses a 'Double-Blind Verification' protocol during a session. What does this involve?",
            "options": [
                "Both the therapist and the client close their eyes for the duration of the session",
                "The therapist records the session and has a third party verify details without knowing the client's identity",
                "The therapist provides the client with historical names to see if they recognize them",
                "The client is hypnotized twice by two different therapists"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Double-blind verification involves a researcher checking the client's claims against historical records without knowing the client's background or the therapist's leading theories, reducing confirmation bias."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "According to the quantitative data provided by Jim Tucker, what is the median age at which children typically stop talking about their previous lives?",
            "options": [
                "Age 4",
                "Age 7",
                "Age 12",
                "Age 18"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The data shows that memories typically emerge around age 3 and fade by age 6 or 7, coinciding with the child's increased focus on their current social environment and school life."
