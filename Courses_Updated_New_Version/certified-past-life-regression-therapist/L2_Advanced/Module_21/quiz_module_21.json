            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Transformation' (L1), what is the primary differentiator between a Level 1 intake and a Level 2 Strategic Intake?",
            "options": [
                "L1 focuses on relaxation, while L2 focuses only on deep trance induction.",
                "L1 is focused on a single-session 'story,' while L2 focuses on the 'Arc of Resolution' across multiple sessions.",
                "L2 requires a medical degree, whereas L1 does not.",
                "L1 avoids somatic cues, while L2 uses only somatic cues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Level 2 practitioners move beyond the 'tourist' approach of single sessions to design a strategic 'Arc of Resolution' that addresses complex, multi-layered soul patterns."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in SOURCE stands for Objective Setting, which involves defining the specific karmic or psychological milestones the client needs to reach for successful resolution."

            "question": "A client presents with an 'Idiosyncratic Somatic Marker' (ISM) of sudden, unexplained coldness in the left hand when discussing career changes. According to L3, how should a practitioner view this?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign of poor circulation requiring immediate medical referral only.",
                "As a psychological defense mechanism intended to stop the session.",
                "As a somatic bridge or 'pointer' to a specific past-life trauma or 'karmic anchor'.",
                "As a sign that the client is not a candidate for regression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced symptom tracking identifies ISMs as somatic bridges that point toward unresolved past-life imprints or karmic anchors stored in the physical body."

            "question": "When sequencing sessions for 'Cathartic Release' (C) in L4, why is it often recommended to delay the primary catharsis until session 3 or 4?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the financial billing for the practitioner.",
                "To ensure the 'Ego-Strength' is sufficient to process the intense emotional discharge without retraumatization.",
                "Because catharsis cannot happen in the first two sessions due to brain wave limitations.",
                "To wait for the client to forget their initial intake goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic sequencing ensures that the client's ego-strength and resource state are built up first, preventing the 'flooding' or retraumatization that can occur with premature catharsis."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners prioritize 'Acute Debts' or those causing significant present-day leakage, as resolving these provides the most immediate relief and builds trust for deeper work."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 72-hour window following a deep emotional release (catharsis) is a period of heightened neuroplasticity where new, healthier beliefs and behaviors can be most effectively anchored."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "During treatment planning, a client exhibits 'Intellectualization'—explaining away every somatic cue with logic. According to L7, how should the practitioner handle this resistance?",
            "options": [
                "By challenging the client's intelligence.",
                "By ending the session immediately.",
                "By utilizing 'Somatic Overloading' or shifting the focus from the 'story' to the raw physical sensation.",
                "By agreeing with their logic to avoid conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To bypass intellectualization, practitioners shift the focus from the narrative (the story) to the raw somatic experience, bypassing the analytical mind's defense mechanisms."

                "Practitioners are allowed to give medical advice if the regression reveals a past-life cause."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic neutrality is essential in L2 work to prevent 'Karmic Entanglement' and counter-transference, ensuring the practitioner remains a clear mirror for the client's process."

            "question": "A client experiences a major breakthrough in Session 2, followed by a sudden desire to cancel Session 3, claiming they are 'totally cured.' L7 identifies this as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Flight into Health' is a common defense mechanism where the ego claims total healing after a minor breakthrough to avoid the more threatening 'Core Debt' that lies beneath."
