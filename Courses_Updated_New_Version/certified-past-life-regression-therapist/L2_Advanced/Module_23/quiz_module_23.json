            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "When utilizing the 'Somatic Gateway' technique (Lesson 1), what is the primary indicator that a client has successfully bypassed the 'Intellectual Guardian' and entered a true re-experiencing state?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to describe scenes in the third person (e.g., 'He is walking').",
                "A shift from past-tense narration to present-tense narration accompanied by physiological changes.",
                "The client reports seeing vivid, movie-like colors without any physical sensation.",
                "The client's heart rate slows down to a resting state of 60 BPM."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition from past-tense ('I was') to present-tense ('I am') is a linguistic marker of 'revivification,' indicating the client is no longer just remembering, but actively re-living the somatic memory."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Simultaneous Incarnations' (Lesson 2), how should a practitioner handle a client who experiences a 'bleed-through' from a life that appears to be in the future?",
            "options": [
                "Correct the client and redirect them to a historical past-life period.",
                "Assume the client is fantasizing and terminate the session.",
                "Treat the experience as a valid parallel timeline, focusing on the emotional resonance rather than chronological logic.",
                "Suggest the client is experiencing a 'Between Lives' state instead of a parallel life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced PLRT recognizes the non-linear nature of the soul. Parallel timelines/future lives are treated with the same clinical validity as historical lives if they hold the 'karmic charge' needing resolution."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes a 'Contract of Sacrifice' often found in Group Karma Dynamics (Lesson 3)?",
            "options": [
                "An agreement where one soul agrees to experience hardship to facilitate the growth of another soul in the cluster.",
                "A forced punishment imposed by a 'Karmic Board' for previous crimes.",
                "A contract that can never be rescinded or renegotiated.",
                "A soul's decision to stop reincarnating entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Soul contracts are voluntary agreements made in the inter-life state. A Contract of Sacrifice involves a soul taking on a difficult role (e.g., a short life or illness) to catalyze the evolution of 'soul mates' or family members."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "When resolving a 'Vow of Poverty' during a session on Complex Karmic Imprints (Lesson 4), what is the final step in the 'Rescission Protocol'?",
            "options": [
                "Burning a physical piece of paper representing the vow.",
                "Identifying the original trauma that necessitated the vow.",
                "The 'Conscious Re-writing' where the client replaces the vow with a new, empowered soul-declaration.",
                "Asking the client to apologize to their current-life bank manager."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "After identifying and releasing the old vow, the practitioner must guide the client to fill that energetic 'void' with a new, conscious intention or soul-declaration to prevent the old pattern from returning."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "During 'Somatic Catharsis' (Lesson 5), a client begins to experience 'Thermic Discharge.' What does this typically manifest as?",
            "options": [
                "The client becoming suddenly aggressive.",
                "Intense shivering, teeth chattering, or waves of heat/cold as the fascia releases stored energy.",
                "The client's skin turning blue due to lack of oxygen.",
                "A complete cessation of all physical movement and breathing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thermic discharge is a classic sign of cellular memory release. As the body processes deep trauma, the autonomic nervous system regulates the 'thaw' of frozen energy through temperature fluctuations and tremors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In 'Talent Retrieval' (Lesson 6), what is the purpose of the 'Bridge Technique'?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client cross over to the 'other side' after death.",
                "To connect the physical neural pathways of the current body to the 'resource' or skill identified in the past life.",
                "To build a bridge between the practitioner and the client's subconscious.",
                "To move the client from a traumatic memory to a pleasant one."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Bridge Technique is used to 'anchor' a past-life resource (like confidence or a specific skill) into the current physical and energetic body, making it accessible in the client's daily life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'The Loop' resistance—repeating the same 30 seconds of a traumatic death scene over and over. According to Lesson 7, what is the most effective intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Ending the session immediately to prevent re-traumatization.",
                "Asking the client to 'zoom out' to a 'Bird's Eye View' (Meta-Position) to break the somatic loop.",
                "Telling the client to 'try harder' to see what happens next.",
                "Hypnotically numbing the client's emotions so they don't feel the loop."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Meta-Position' or dissociation technique allows the client to observe the event without being 'locked' in the somatic experience, which breaks the neurological loop and allows for processing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "Which 'Practitioner Hygiene' practice (Lesson 8) is specifically designed to prevent 'Empathic Overload' after a session involving heavy karmic clearing?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Golden Shield' visualization before the session and 'Cord Cutting' immediately after.",
                "Drinking a cup of coffee to stay alert.",
                "Sharing the details of the session on social media (anonymously).",
                "Charging the client a higher fee for difficult sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Energetic hygiene involves both 'pre-session shielding' and 'post-session decoupling' (cord cutting) to ensure the practitioner does not carry the client's released 'karmic debris' in their own field."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Soul Clusters.' Statistics from regression research suggest that in a typical group karma dynamic, what percentage of 'primary' people in a client's current life were likely present in previous incarnations?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 10%",
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Over 70-80%",
                "100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case study data from pioneers like Dr. Michael Newton and Dr. Helen Wambach suggest that souls tend to incarnate in clusters, with the vast majority (70-80%) of significant current-life relationships having deep historical roots."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "What is the primary risk of failing to perform 'Clinical Integration' (Lesson 8) after a major somatic release?",
            "options": [
                "The client might forget the practitioner's name.",
                "The 'Amnesic Barrier' may re-establish itself, causing the client to dismiss the experience as 'just a dream' within 48 hours.",
                "The client will become permanently stuck in the past life.",
                "The practitioner will lose their certification."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is the process of grounding the 'abstract' regression into 'concrete' current-life awareness. Without it, the conscious mind often uses 'skeptical drift' to invalidate the experience, negating the therapeutic benefits."
