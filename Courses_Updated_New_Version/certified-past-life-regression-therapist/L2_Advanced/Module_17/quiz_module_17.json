            "question": "A client repeatedly interrupts the session stating, 'I think I'm just making this up' or 'This is just my imagination.' Which technique is specifically designed to bypass this 'Analytical Wall'?",

                "Suggesting the client take a deeper breath and try harder to see images.",

                "Asking the client to analyze why they feel they are making it up while in the trance state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid-fire questioning prevents the analytical left-brain from having enough time to evaluate or censor the incoming data, forcing the subconscious to provide raw sensory input."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, when navigating 'Non-Human' incarnations (such as elemental or light-based beings), what is the primary indicator of an authentic memory over a fantasy?",

                "The client describes detailed, cinematic landscapes that look like popular sci-fi movies.",
                "The client reports a distinct 'somatic frequency shift' and a non-linear perception of time or identity.",

                "The client experiences standard human emotions like 'embarrassment' or 'pride' in the non-human form."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Authentic non-human incarnations are typically characterized by unique energetic signatures (somatic shifts) and a logic/perspective that differs significantly from human ego-based emotions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Dissociative Observer' technique allows the client to process the information and the 'soul's exit' without being overwhelmed by the physical or emotional trauma of the body."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-linear sequences often occur because the subconscious is highlighting a specific theme (e.g., betrayal) across multiple lives; the therapist's role is to find the 'Thematic Bridge.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Authentic memories carry a sense of 'I am/I was,' whereas attachments often present as a separate consciousness or a 'heavy' energy that does not belong to the client's own soul history."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soul exchanges (Walk-ins) typically occur during a 'Threshold Event' where the original soul vacates the body due to trauma or completion of contract, and a new soul enters."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating 'shadow' lives requires moving beyond ego-judgment to understand the soul's evolution and the lessons learned from the perspective of the perpetrator."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Time looping in regression often signifies a 'stuck' point where the soul's consciousness is replaying an event until the necessary awareness or release is achieved."
