            "question": "Which brainwave frequency range is the primary target for Past Life Regression, facilitating the 'bridge' where the conscious mind remains observant while the subconscious provides vivid imagery?",
            "options": [
                "Beta (13-30 Hz)",
                "Alpha (8-12 Hz)",
                "Theta (4-8 Hz)",
                "Delta (0.5-4 Hz)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta (4-8 Hz) is the 'twilight' state of deep relaxation and hypnagogia where the Somatic Bridge is most accessible, allowing for the retrieval of soul memories while maintaining a thread of conscious awareness."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the 'Somatic Induction' methodology, why is focusing on physical sensation preferred over direct verbal suggestion for entering a trance?",
            "options": [
                "Physical sensations are easier for the client to fake.",
                "Somatic focus bypasses the 'Critical Factor' by overloading the nervous system with internal sensory data, leaving less bandwidth for analytical resistance.",
                "It is a faster way to reach the Delta state of deep sleep.",
                "Verbal suggestions are ineffective for clients with high IQs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By focusing on the 'felt sense' of the body, the client's analytical mind (Critical Factor) becomes preoccupied with internal data, allowing the therapist to guide the client into deeper states without triggering skepticism or logic-based resistance."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Advanced PMR, what is the 'Rebound Effect' and how is it utilized in PLR?",
            "options": [
                "The tendency for a client to wake up suddenly if they go too deep.",
                "The physiological phenomenon where intentional muscular tension leads to a deeper, involuntary parasympathetic relaxation upon release.",
                "The emotional outburst that occurs after a past-life memory is recovered.",
                "The return of physical pain after the session ends."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced PMR utilizes the Rebound Effect: by having the client briefly and intensely tense a muscle group, the subsequent neurological release triggers a deeper state of parasympathetic dominance than simple relaxation alone."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 introduces 'Coherent Breathing' as a tool for the Somatic Bridge. What is the specific rhythm recommended to maximize Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and nervous system regulation?",
            "options": [
                "3 seconds in, 3 seconds out",
                "5.5 seconds in, 5.5 seconds out",
                "10 seconds in, 2 seconds out",
                "Rapid, shallow chest breathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A rhythm of 5.5 seconds for both inhalation and exhalation (approximately 5.5 breaths per minute) is scientifically shown to optimize HRV and bring the heart and brain into coherence, facilitating the transition to Theta."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Somatic Sanctuary' is established. What is the primary clinical purpose of this 'Sanctuary' during a regression?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a place for the client to sleep if they get tired.",
                "To serve as a 'neuro-physiological anchor' that the client can return to if the past-life memory becomes somatically overwhelming or traumatic.",
                "To allow the therapist to take a break during the session.",
                "To test if the client is capable of visualization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Sanctuary is a safe, grounded physical state established early in the induction. It acts as a safety mechanism, ensuring the client can 'de-escalate' from intense past-life sensations back to a state of bodily safety."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "The 'Staircase of Sensation' (Lesson 6) uses 'Sensory Layering' to deepen the trance. Which of the following best describes this technique?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client to count backwards from 100 to 0.",
                "Progressively adding visual, auditory, tactile, and proprioceptive details to each step of the descent.",
                "Having the client walk up and down a physical flight of stairs.",
                "Using loud music to drown out external noises."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory Layering involves asking the client to notice not just the 'sight' of the stairs, but the texture of the handrail (tactile), the sound of their footsteps (auditory), and the weight of their body (proprioceptive) to deepen the hypnotic immersion."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client exhibits 'Somatic Armoring'—clenched fists and a rigid jaw—during the induction. Based on Lesson 7, what is the most effective way to manage this resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore it and continue with the script.",
                "Directly challenge the client to stop being resistant.",
                "Utilize 'Fractionation' or 'Somatic Softening' by bringing conscious awareness to the tension and inviting the breath to move 'into' the armor.",
                "End the session immediately as the client is not ready."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Armoring is a subconscious defense. By using 'Somatic Softening'—guiding the client to breathe into the specific area of tension—the therapist helps the client process the resistance rather than fighting against it."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "What is the 'Threshold' (Lesson 8) in the context of Somatic Induction?",
            "options": [
                "The door to the therapist's office.",
                "The exact moment the client falls asleep.",
                "The point of transition where a physical sensation (e.g., a heavy chest) transforms into a mnemonic trigger for a past-life memory.",
                "The maximum amount of time a session can last."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Threshold is the 'pivot point' where the somatic work ends and the regression begins. It is the moment where the body's sensations act as a gateway into the soul's storage of memories."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study cited in Lesson 2 found that clients who reached a Theta state via somatic induction showed a _____ increase in 'imagery vividness' compared to those using standard progressive relaxation.",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "25%",
                "40%",
                "Over 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that somatic-based inductions, which engage the parietal lobe's sensory processing, lead to significantly higher (over 60%) vividness in subconscious imagery compared to purely verbal relaxation techniques."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "During the induction, your client experiences a 'Somatic Discharge' (involuntary twitching of the legs). What does this typically indicate in PLR therapy?",
            "options": [
                "The client is having a seizure and needs medical help.",
                "The client is bored and trying to wake up.",
                "The nervous system is releasing stored kinetic energy or 'trauma loading' as it shifts from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance.",
                "The induction has failed and you must restart."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Discharges (twitches, sighs, or rapid eye movements) are positive indicators that the nervous system is shedding 'armoring' and excess charge, clearing the way for deep memory retrieval."
