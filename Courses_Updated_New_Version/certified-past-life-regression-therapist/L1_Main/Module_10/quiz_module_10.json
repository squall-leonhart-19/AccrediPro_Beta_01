            "options": [
                "To use physical sensations as a gateway to the subconscious memory",
                "To explain the scientific theory of reincarnation to the client",
                "To perform deep tissue massage before the regression begins",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic Induction uses the body's current physical sensations or 'somatic bridges' to bypass the critical analytical mind and access stored subconscious imprints."

            "options": [
                "Beta (13-30 Hz) - High alert and analytical thinking",

                "Delta (0.5-4 Hz) - Deep dreamless sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Theta state is the 'twilight' state where the subconscious is accessible and imagery is vivid, yet the client remains conscious enough to communicate with the therapist."

            "options": [
                "To force the client to judge their past actions immediately",
                "To prevent premature emotional flooding and allow the narrative to unfold accurately",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Witness Technique allows the client to gather data (who, what, where) without being overwhelmed by emotion, which ensures a more complete and accurate retrieval of the memory."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soul Contracts are deep-seated subconscious 'vows' (e.g., 'I will never be rich') made during traumatic past events that continue to influence the client's current life reality."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic discharge (shaking, crying, temperature changes) is a vital sign that the nervous system is finally releasing the 'frozen' energy of a past trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is the process of 'anchoring' the insights; without connecting the past life wisdom to the present life, the session remains merely an interesting story rather than a therapeutic tool."

                "Asking the client to 'try harder' to see pictures",
                "Focusing on a specific physical sensation or 'tightness' in the body and following it back",
                "Ending the session because the client is not hypnotizable",
                "Showing the client pictures of historical locations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Bridge uses the body's physical 'feeling' as a direct line to the subconscious, which is often more effective than forced visualization for 'kinesthetic' clients."

                "No difference in outcomes",
                "They were unable to remember the session afterwards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The data suggests that structured observation (O) creates a 'safe container' that makes the eventual cathartic release (C) more profound and lasting."
