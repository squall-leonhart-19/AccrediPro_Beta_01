            "options": [
                "To encourage the client to experience intense emotional catharsis immediately.",
                "To establish a neutral, non-judgmental perspective that prioritizes data collection over emotional reaction.",
                "To guide the client toward specific historical dates using leading questions.",
                "To interpret the symbolic meaning of the client's visions in real-time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Observer Stance is designed to foster neutrality, allowing the client to gather 'objective' data (the 'O' in the ASIP/SOAP model) without the interference of premature emotional processing or therapist bias."

            "options": [
                "'Are you wearing a medieval tunic?'",
                "'Do you feel sad that you are alone?'",

                "'Is that the sound of a horse-drawn carriage?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clean Language prompts are open-ended and do not project the therapist's assumptions onto the client's experience. Asking what they notice allows the client's subconscious to provide the data."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In Multi-Sensory Mapping (Lesson 3), why is 'Sensory Anchoring' used when a client's focus begins to flicker or fade?",
            "options": [
                "To end the session immediately for safety.",
                "To deepen the trance state by focusing on a specific, stable physical sensation like the texture of the ground.",
                "To bypass the 'Objective' phase and move straight to the 'Affective' phase.",
                "To prove to the client that the experience is scientifically real."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory Anchoring uses the VAKOG (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Olfactory, Gustatory) system to ground the client in the experience, with kinesthetic sensations (like the feel of the floor) being particularly effective for stabilization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Geographical Mapping involves identifying landmarks, cardinal directions, and environmental features to provide a spatial context for the regression."

                "Skip the physical description and focus only on the persona's name."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Looking at the feet is a standard 'Vessel' identification protocol because it is less likely to trigger the 'analytical mind' than looking in a mirror, and provides immediate data on gender, status, and era."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Theatre Screen' or 'Bird's Eye View' techniques create a psychological buffer (disassociation), allowing the client to observe the events without being overwhelmed by the emotional 'affect'."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Material culture, including the quality of textiles, the presence of luxury items, or the crudeness of tools, provides objective data regarding the persona's social and economic standing."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "According to the 2021 study on memory recall mentioned in the course, why is the 'Objective Log' (Lesson 8) critical for the therapeutic process?",
            "options": [
                "It provides the therapist with marketing material.",
                "It captures sensory details that correlate with higher narrative stability and lower risk of 'false memory' confabulation.",
                "It is a legal requirement for all life coaches.",
                "It allows the therapist to correct the client's historical inaccuracies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Documenting specific sensory details (The Objective Log) helps stabilize the narrative and provides a factual baseline that can be used later in the 'Integration' phase."

            "question": "A client says, 'I feel like I'm in a cold, stone room, and I'm very scared.' As a therapist practicing the Observer Stance, what is your best response?",
            "options": [
                "'Why are you scared? Tell me about your childhood.'",
                "'You are safe. Notice the coldness of the stone. What color is the stone, and where is the light coming from?'",
                "'Stop being scared and focus on the dates.'",
                "'That sounds like a dungeon in 15th-century France.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapist acknowledges safety and then redirects the client back to 'Objective' sensory details (the stone, the light) to anchor them and prevent emotional flooding."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What is the primary transition signal that the 'Objective Observation' phase is complete and the session should move to the 'Subjective/Affective' phase?",
            "options": [
                "The client falls asleep.",
                "The 60-minute mark is reached.",
                "Sufficient environmental and persona data has been mapped and the client naturally begins to express internal feelings or motivations.",
                "The therapist decides they have enough information to write a report."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The transition occurs once the 'stage' is set. Once the environment, vessel, and context are established (Objective), the therapist can then safely explore the 'Why' and the 'Feelings' (Subjective/Affective)."
