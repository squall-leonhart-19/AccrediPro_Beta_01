            "question": "In the S.O.U.R.C.E. Framework™, what does the 'O' represent, and why is it critical for the integrity of the session?",
            "options": [
                "Organic Origin; to ensure the memory is not imagined.",
                "Objective Observation; to prevent the therapist from leading the client and to maintain the 'Neutral Witness' state.",
                "Open Orientation; to allow the client to move freely through time.",
                "Optimal Outcome; to focus the session on healing rather than trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Objective Observation is the second phase of the S.O.U.R.C.E. Framework™, emphasizing the therapist's role as a neutral witness to prevent leading the client or projecting biases."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "During Lesson 2 (Somatic Induction), the 'Somatic Bridge' is used to access cellular memory. What is the primary indicator that a client has successfully crossed this bridge?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to describe a historical setting in detail.",
                "A shift from localized physical sensation to a spontaneous emotional or visual narrative.",
                "The client reaches a Theta brainwave state as measured by an EEG.",
                "The client reports feeling completely relaxed and detached from their body."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Bridge is successful when a physical sensation (like a pain in the neck) transforms into a narrative or emotional memory, indicating access to cellular storage."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client in the Objective Observation phase says, 'I see a man standing over me. I think he's my father.' Which response best demonstrates the 'Neutral Witnessing' taught in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "'How do you feel about your father being there?'",
                "'Is he angry with you?'",
                "'Notice the man. Without assuming who he is, what do you observe about his presence and actions?'",
                "'Yes, that is likely a past-life version of your current father.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neutral Witnessing avoids confirming the client's assumptions (like the identity of the man) to allow the narrative to unfold organically without premature labeling."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Soul Contracts, how can a therapist identify a 'Karmic Loop' during a regression session?",
            "options": [
                "By the presence of a specific soul mate in every lifetime.",
                "Through the repetition of a specific emotional reaction to different traumatic events across multiple scenes.",
                "If the client died at the same age in three consecutive lives.",
                "If the client reports seeing a literal signed contract in the spirit realm."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soul contracts and karmic loops are often identified by recurring emotional patterns or 'themes' that persist regardless of the external historical context."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In the 'Resolving the Karma' phase (Lesson 5), what is the primary purpose of the 'Higher Perspective' technique?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client forgive the perpetrator so they don't have to see them again.",
                "To view the lifetime from the soul's level to extract the intended lesson rather than the trauma.",
                "To erase the memory of the trauma from the client's subconscious.",
                "To prove that the client was actually the 'bad guy' in a previous life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resolving karma involves shifting from the ego's perspective of the victim/villain to the soul's perspective of the 'lesson' or 'growth opportunity' provided by the experience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Cathartic Release.' If a client experiences an intense abreaction (uncontrolled shaking or weeping), what is the therapist's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately wake the client up to stop the distress.",
                "Ensure the client remains in the 'Observing Self' while allowing the physical energy to discharge safely.",
                "Ask the client to analyze why they are crying while it is happening.",
                "Tell the client to suppress the emotion to stay focused on the narrative."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapist must facilitate a safe discharge of stored energy (catharsis) while ensuring the client stays grounded in the 'Observing Self' to prevent re-traumatization."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Essential Integration' is described as the bridge to current life. Which of these is a 'Post-Session Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "A specific historical date discovered during the regression.",
                "A physical gesture or phrase the client uses to recall the wisdom gained during the session.",
                "The name of the past-life personality.",
                "A list of all the people the client recognized from their current life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchoring involves creating a tangible trigger (gesture, word, or object) that allows the client to access the 'healed state' or 'wisdom' in their daily life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A client reports 'nothing but darkness' during the induction. According to Lesson 8 (Advanced Troubleshooting), what is the most effective 'Synthesis' technique to move forward?",
            "options": [
                "End the session immediately as the client is not hypnotizable.",
                "Ask the client to 'Describe the quality of the darkness' to engage the somatic/sensory system.",
                "Tell the client they are failing the process and need to relax more.",
                "Switch to a different modality like Reiki or Massage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the S.O.U.R.C.E. Framework, 'darkness' is treated as a sensory input. Describing its quality (temperature, weight, texture) often leads to the next layer of the subconscious."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Which phase of the S.O.U.R.C.E. Framework™ is specifically designed to prevent 'Spiritual Bypassing'?",

                "Resolving the Karma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Essential Integration prevents spiritual bypassing by requiring the client to apply the 'spiritual' insights to practical, real-world behavioral changes in their current life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "According to the course data, what is the most common reason for a 'failed' regression session during the 'Uncovering' phase?",
            "options": [
                "The client doesn't believe in reincarnation.",
                "The therapist asked leading questions that shut down the client's organic imagery.",
                "The client was too deep in hypnosis and fell asleep.",
                "The past life was too boring to remember."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Uncovering' phase relies on organic narrative flow; therapist intervention through leading questions is the primary cause of narrative 'stalling' or 'falsification.'"
