            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Subconscious Storytelling,' what is the primary indicator that a client is accessing a genuine past-life narrative rather than 'active imagination'?",
            "options": [
                "The narrative follows a perfect, linear chronological order without gaps.",
                "The presence of 'Affective Resonance' where sensory details trigger spontaneous emotional shifts.",
                "The client identifies themselves as a famous historical figure with 100% accuracy.",
                "The client remains in a deep theta state without speaking for the duration of the story."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Authentic subconscious narratives are characterized by affective resonance—where sensory details (smell, temperature, textures) are inextricably linked to physiological and emotional responses that the conscious mind did not 'plan.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Fast-Forward' technique allows the therapist to bypass non-essential biographical data and move the client's focus to pivotal moments of karmic significance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soul Contracts are energetic agreements made before birth, often involving 'antagonistic' roles that provide the necessary friction for soul growth and the resolution of specific karmic lessons."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Archetypal guardians often appear at the 'threshold' of significant memories, acting as a psychological defense mechanism that requires the therapist to use specific questioning to gain 'entry' to the ISE."

                "The ISE provides the client with their past-life social security number."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the death scene (SDE) provides transition, the ISE (Initial Sensitizing Event) is the causal point where the soul first accepted a specific trauma-based belief that still affects them today."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Soul groups often reincarnate together in different roles (Role Reversal) to experience various perspectives of a single dynamic, such as power, betrayal, or nurturing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective PLR questioning is 'clean' and somatic-focused, asking the client to report their internal experience rather than suggesting external facts or emotions."

                "To prove the historical accuracy of the client's claims using Google.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the process of integrating the insights gained during regression into the client's current reality, ensuring the 'story' becomes a catalyst for real-world healing."

            "options": [
                "The client is highly advanced and viewing multiple lives at once.",
                "The client is experiencing 'Resistance' or a 'Trauma Block' that prevents focus on the ISE.",
                "The induction was too deep and the client has fallen asleep.",
                "The client has no past lives and is making it up."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fragmentation often occurs when the subconscious mind is 'skimming' the surface of a trauma but is afraid to land on the ISE. It requires the therapist to use grounding and 'Affect Bridge' techniques."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical observation suggests that identifying the causal 'root' (ISE) leads to significantly higher rates of resolution than merely 'watching' the death scene, as it allows for the reframing of the original trauma."
