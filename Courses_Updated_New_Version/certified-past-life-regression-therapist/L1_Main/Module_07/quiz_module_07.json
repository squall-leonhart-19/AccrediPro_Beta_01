            "question": "In the S.O.U.R.C.E. Framework™, what is the primary purpose of the 'Somatic Induction' (S) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To lead the client into a specific historical era through guided visualization",
                "To bypass the critical faculty by focusing on physiological sensations as the gateway to memory",
                "To ensure the client is physically comfortable enough to fall into a light sleep",
                "To test the client's suggestibility levels before the regression begins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Induction focuses on the body's stored imprints, using physical sensations to anchor the subconscious mind and bypass the analytical 'critical faculty' without using leading visualizations."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "During 'Objective Observation' (O), which of the following is considered a 'clean' or non-leading question?",
            "options": [
                "Are you wearing leather sandals or boots?",
                "Is the person standing in front of you your father?",
                "What, if anything, are you noticing about your feet or the ground beneath you?",
                "Can you feel the heat of the desert sun on your skin?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective Observation requires non-leading language. Asking 'what, if anything' allows the client to provide their own sensory data without the therapist suggesting specific details like sandals, heat, or identities."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "When 'Uncovering the Narrative' (U), the therapist notices the client is jumping between disconnected scenes. What is the most effective technique to establish a 'Soul's Timeline'?",
            "options": [
                "Direct the client to return to the very first moment of that lifetime",
                "Ask the client to find a 'pivotal emotional anchor' that connects the scenes",
                "End the session because the narrative is too fragmented to be valid",
                "Instruct the client to ignore the fragments and look for a calendar or date"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Uncovering phase, emotional anchors are used to map the soul's timeline, as subconscious memory is often organized by thematic or emotional significance rather than linear chronology."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Resolving the Karma' (R), how is 'Spiritual Debt' defined within the S.O.U.R.C.E. Framework™?",
            "options": [
                "A literal financial or moral tally that must be paid back in equal measure",
                "An energetic 'loop' caused by an unlearned lesson or an incomplete emotional cycle",
                "A punishment handed down by a higher council for past misdeeds",
                "A psychological manifestation of current-life guilt projected onto a fantasy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Karma is viewed as 'mechanics' rather than 'judgment.' It represents an energetic loop or incomplete cycle where the soul seeks resolution for a lesson that remains unintegrated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "During a 'Cathartic Release' (C), a client begins to experience a high-intensity abreaction (shaking and heavy weeping). What is the therapist's FIRST priority?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately wake the client up to prevent psychological trauma",
                "Use the 'Dissociation' or 'Observational Distance' technique to move them to a 'birds-eye view'",
                "Tell the client to stop crying so they can describe the scene more clearly",
                "Increase the intensity of the induction to deepen the trance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Managing high-intensity discharge requires maintaining safety. Moving the client to an observational (third-person) perspective allows the emotional release to continue without the client being overwhelmed by the direct somatic experience."

        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "The 'Essential Integration' (E) phase is considered successful when the client:",
            "options": [
                "Can provide verifiable historical evidence of the past life",
                "Successfully identifies the names of all family members in the regression",
                "Articulates a clear, actionable link between the past-life lesson and a current-life challenge",
                "Expresses a desire to book another session immediately to see more lives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration is the 'bridge' to reality. Its success is measured by the client's ability to apply the wisdom or resolution found in the regression to their current life circumstances and behaviors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Ethical Standards, what is the 'False Memory' risk in PLRT?",
            "options": [
                "The risk that a client will lie about their experience to please the therapist",
                "The phenomenon where leading questions or suggestions create vivid but fabricated memories",
                "The possibility that the client is actually remembering a movie they saw as a child",
                "The ethical violation of a therapist believing the client's story is true"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical standards emphasize that the subconscious is highly suggestible. False memories can be inadvertently 'implanted' by the therapist through leading questions, which is why the 'Objective Observation' phase is so critical."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic neck pain that has no medical cause. Which phase of the S.O.U.R.C.E. Framework™ is most likely to provide the initial 'entry point' for this session?",
            "options": [
                "Objective Observation (O)",
                "Resolving the Karma (R)",
                "Somatic Induction (S)",
                "Essential Integration (E)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Induction (S) uses current physical sensations (like unexplained neck pain) as the 'bridge' or gateway to the subconscious memory where that sensation originated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "What is the therapist's role during the 'Uncovering the Narrative' (U) phase when a client encounters a 'Death Scene'?",
            "options": [
                "To skip the death scene quickly to avoid client distress",
                "To ensure the client stays in the body to feel the full transition",
                "To guide the client through the transition to the 'Inter-life' state to gain perspective",
                "To verify the cause of death for the final report"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The transition/death scene is often where the most significant 'lessons' are realized. Moving the client into the 'Inter-life' or 'Between Lives' state allows them to view the life's purpose objectively."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which ethical boundary is MOST at risk when a PLRT practitioner begins to provide medical or legal advice based on a client's regression?",
            "options": [
                "Confidentiality",
                "Scope of Practice",
                "Dual Relationships",
                "Informed Consent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing medical or legal advice falls outside the 'Scope of Practice' for a regression therapist. Practitioners must remain within their trained competency and refer clients to appropriate professionals for medical or legal issues."
