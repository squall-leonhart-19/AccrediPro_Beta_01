            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic Induction is the first step of the S.O.U.R.C.E.™ framework, utilizing the body's current physical sensations (somatic anchors) to access cellular memories stored in the subconscious."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Bridge technique involves leaning into the sensation to allow the subconscious to retrieve the associated memory or origin point of that physical imprint."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Integration Gap occurs when a client has a 'fascinating experience' but no transformation happens because they haven't bridged the past-life insights into current-life behavioral changes."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Per L1 Case Management guidelines (Lesson 8), what is the ethical protocol if a client claims they were a famous historical figure (e.g., Cleopatra)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study of Marcus highlights how being silenced in a past-life role (town crier) created a cellular memory that manifested as glossophobia in his current professional life."

            "id": "q15_10",
