                "A system of divine punishment and reward for moral behavior",
                "A self-perpetuating cycle of energetic cause and effect focused on soul evolution",
                "A fixed destiny that cannot be altered or resolved in the current lifetime",
                "A psychological projection of current-life guilt onto fictional historical scenarios"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinically, karma is viewed as an energetic feedback loop or 'cause and effect' mechanism designed for learning and evolution, rather than a moralistic system of punishment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "The contract was signed in a physical document during the regression",

                "The soul involved in the contract is no longer present in the client's current life"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unfinished business is characterized by a persistent, irrational emotional charge or behavioral loop that continues even after the client consciously understands the situation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing involves shifting the subconscious perspective from a victimhood/failure narrative to one of soul growth, wisdom, and the completion of a specific evolutionary objective."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Threshold represents the transition from 'knowing' why something happened (Resolution) to 'feeling' the release of the stored energy in the body (Catharsis)."

                "Advicting the client to find the person's descendants in the modern world"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Balancing energetic debts involves symbolic acts of restitution or the realization that the 'debt' has been paid through centuries of remorse, allowing the soul to move forward."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vows of Silence often manifest somatically as issues in the throat chakra area, such as chronic laryngitis, stuttering, or a physical 'tightness' when attempting to speak up."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "According to the module, why is the 'Inter-life' (Life Between Lives) space often the best place to resolve karma?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client cannot feel any emotions in that space",
                "Because it allows for a 'Life Review' from a non-egoic, higher-perspective vantage point",
                "Because the therapist does not need to use hypnosis in that space",
                "Because karma does not exist once the physical body is shed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Inter-life space provides a 'neutral ground' where the soul can review the previous life's events without the interference of the human ego, making it easier to identify lessons and resolve contracts."
