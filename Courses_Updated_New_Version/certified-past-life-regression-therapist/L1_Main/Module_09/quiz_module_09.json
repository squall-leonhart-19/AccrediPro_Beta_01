            "question": "According to the neurobiological principles in Lesson 1, what occurs during a 'therapeutic catharsis' regarding the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "The HPA axis is permanently deactivated to prevent future stress.",
                "There is a controlled 'spike' in sympathetic arousal followed by a profound parasympathetic shift, effectively 'resetting' the stress response.",
                "Cortisol levels remain elevated for 48 hours to ensure the memory is seared into the conscious mind.",
                "The amygdala bypasses the HPA axis entirely to prevent emotional flooding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 explains that catharsis involves a peak in sympathetic activity (release) followed by a parasympathetic 'reset,' which helps recalibrate the HPA axis and reduce chronic cortisol load."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Somatic Shaking' or involuntary tremors during regression are identified as:",
            "options": [
                "A sign of a failed induction that requires immediate termination of the session.",
                "The nervous system's way of discharging 'trapped' kinetic energy associated with the fight-or-flight response.",
                "A purely psychological manifestation with no physiological basis.",
                "A symptom of electrolyte imbalance that must be treated medically."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 describes somatic shaking as a natural discharge mechanism of the nervous system, allowing the body to release the energy of incomplete biological responses from the past-life trauma."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "When decoding a 'Soul Contract' (Lesson 3), what is the primary indicator that a contract is 'karmically redundant'?",
            "options": [
                "The contract was signed in a language the client doesn't speak.",
                "The contract is more than 500 years old.",
                "The original lesson has been learned, but the restrictive behavior or 'vow' persists as a subconscious habit.",
                "The contract involves more than three people."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 teaches that contracts become redundant when the soul has integrated the wisdom of the experience, but the 'energetic fine print' (like a vow of poverty) continues to limit the current life unnecessarily."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Epigenetic Inheritance.' What percentage of trauma-related markers were found to be reversible in recent studies cited in the curriculum?",
            "options": [
                "0% (Epigenetics are fixed at birth)",
                "Approximately 15-20% through diet alone",
                "Significant evidence suggests that focused therapeutic intervention can 'silence' specific stress-response gene expressions.",
                "100% of all ancestral trauma is cleared in a single 60-minute session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 highlights that while we inherit epigenetic markers, neuroplasticity and therapeutic resolution (like regression) can influence gene expression and 'silence' inherited trauma responses."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "What is the 'Bridge' technique in Lesson 5 designed to accomplish during the integration phase?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client physically travel to the location of the past life.",
                "To create a cognitive and emotional link between the past-life 'lesson' and a specific, current-day challenge.",
                "To build a wall between the past life and the present life to prevent 'bleeding.'",
                "To convince the client's family that the regression was real."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Bridge technique is a core integration tool used to ensure the wisdom gained in the 'then' is actively applied to the 'now,' preventing the session from being just an interesting story."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6, how does 'Long-Term Potentiation' (LTP) relate to anchoring wisdom?",
            "options": [
                "It is the process of forgetting the trauma so it cannot return.",
                "It is the strengthening of synaptic connections through repeated activation, which 'hardwires' the new, positive insights into the brain.",
                "It is a type of sedative used during deep trance.",
                "It is the weakening of the prefrontal cortex to allow for more imagination."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 explains that by 'anchoring' the insights through repetition and emotional resonance, we utilize LTP to make the new, healthy neural pathways more dominant than the old trauma pathways."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "In the S.O.U.R.C.E. Troubleshooting Framework (Lesson 7), what does the 'U' stand for when a client's progress stalls?",
            "options": [
                "Unconscious Mind",

                "Unresolved Induction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the S.O.U.R.C.E. framework, 'U' refers to Underlying Secondary Gain—the subconscious reason a client might resist healing because the symptom provides a perceived (though maladaptive) benefit."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 outlines 'Professional Standards.' If a client reveals a history of severe clinical psychosis during a regression intake, the therapist should:",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with caution but increase the induction time.",
                "Refer the client to a qualified mental health professional, as regression may be contraindicated for those with active psychosis.",
                "Ignore the history as 'past-life interference.'",
                "Use the regression to 'cure' the psychosis by finding the past-life origin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 emphasizes that professional ethics and scope of practice require screening for contraindications like active psychosis to ensure client safety."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Which neurochemical is primarily associated with the 'Anxiolytic' (anxiety-reducing) effect immediately following a successful ancestral clearing (Lesson 4)?",
            "options": [
                "Adrenaline",
                "GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)",
                "Thyroxine",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The curriculum notes that the profound sense of calm and 'lightness' following ancestral clearing is often linked to an increase in GABA activity, which inhibits overactive stress signals."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the 'Neutralization Protocol' for a Soul Contract requires the client to:",
            "options": [
                "Burn a physical piece of paper in the session.",
                "Verbally state their intent to revoke the contract using the 'Law of Sovereignty' while in a somatically charged state.",
                "Pay a 'karmic debt' to the therapist.",
                "Wait seven days before speaking to the person involved in the contract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 teaches that for a contract to be neutralized, the client must use their conscious will (Sovereignty) while the nervous system is engaged (somatically charged) to ensure the release 'takes' at a subconscious level."
