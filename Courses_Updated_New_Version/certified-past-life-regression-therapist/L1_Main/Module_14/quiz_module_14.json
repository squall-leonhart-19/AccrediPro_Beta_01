            "question": "In the neurobiology of past life recall, which brain wave frequency (30-100 Hz) is most associated with the 'Aha!' moment and the binding of disparate information into a cohesive memory?",
            "options": ["Alpha waves", "Theta waves", "Delta waves", "Gamma waves"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Gamma waves are associated with high-level information processing and the 'binding' of memory fragments into a cohesive narrative during regression."

            "options": ["Proprioception", "Interoception", "Exteroception", "Neuroception"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body, which acts as a somatic bridge to deep-seated cellular memories."

            "question": "What is the primary therapeutic goal of the 'Neutral Witness' state in Objective Observation (O)?",
            "options": ["To fully dissociate the client from all emotions", "To allow the client to experience the event without being overwhelmed by it", "To prove the historical accuracy of the past life", "To ensure the client remains in a deep Delta sleep state"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Witness allows for 'dual awareness,' where the client observes the past life while remaining anchored in the present safety of the therapist's office."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration, derived from Somatic Experiencing, involves breaking down the discharge of energy into small, tolerable pieces to prevent re-traumatization."
