            "question": "In the advanced S.O.L.A.C.E. Framework™, how does the 'L' (Liminal Space) transition from Level 1 to Level 2 mastery?",
            "options": [
                "From simply being present to actively managing the environment for the family.",
                "From observing the transition to intuitively navigating the psychological 'in-between' state of the dying and their kin.",
                "From providing physical comfort to focusing strictly on legal documentation.",
                "From silence to constant verbal reassurance and narrative therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L2 mastery involves a shift from passive observation to the intuitive navigation of the liminal space, recognizing the complex psychological and spiritual 'in-between' states that occur during the active dying process."

            "options": [
                "A healthy three-way communication channel between the patient, doctor, and doula.",
                "The process of three family members agreeing on a single care plan.",
                "A dysfunctional dynamic where two family members pull a third party (the doula) into their conflict to reduce tension between themselves.",
                "The legal requirement to have three witnesses for an Ethical Will."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triangulation is a common family system stress response where two people in conflict involve a third person (often the doula) to deflect tension, which the doula must recognize and neutralize to maintain professional boundaries."

                "Rapid, shallow breathing at a rate of over 30 breaths per minute.",
                "Deep, labored gasping known as 'air hunger.'",
                "A rhythmic pattern of breathing that builds in intensity, then fades, followed by a period of apnea (no breathing).",
                "Wet, gurgling sounds caused by secretions in the upper airway."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a specific pattern of crescendo-decrescendo breathing followed by apnea, often indicating that the patient is in the final hours or days of life."

            "options": [
                "An Ethical Will is legally binding in all 50 states, whereas a Last Will is not.",
                "A Last Will distributes physical assets; an Ethical Will transmits values, life lessons, blessings, and wisdom.",
                "An Ethical Will must be written by a lawyer, whereas a Last Will can be oral.",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same document."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While a Last Will deals with the distribution of material wealth and property, an Ethical Will is a non-legal document focused on passing down the 'spiritual' or 'values-based' legacy of the individual."

                "An Advance Directive is only for people over the age of 65.",
                "A POLST is written by the Death Doula, while the Advance Directive is written by the family.",
                "A POLST only covers funeral arrangements, not medical care."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A POLST/MOLST translates a patient's wishes into immediate medical orders that emergency personnel are legally required to follow, unlike an Advance Directive, which serves as a guide for future decision-making."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Clinical evidence suggests that hearing is typically the last sense to go; therefore, doulas prioritize auditory comfort (music, whispering, reading) during the final vigil."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the active dying phase, the doula transitions into a role of environmental stewardship and emotional grounding for the family, as the patient is often non-communicative."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS) is the emotional toll taken on a provider who is witness to the trauma and suffering of others, a key risk factor for Death Doulas that requires proactive self-care."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A patient experiences 'Terminal Lucidity' (The Surge). How should the L2 Doula best synthesize this clinical observation for the family?",

                "Ignore it to avoid giving the family false hope.",

                "Immediately call for an increase in sedation to keep the patient calm."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Terminal Lucidity is a brief period of unexpected mental clarity. The doula's role is to help the family utilize this 'gift of time' for closure while gently managing expectations about the impending transition."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scope Creep occurs when a doula begins performing medical, legal, or psychological tasks they are not licensed to do, which creates significant liability and professional ethical violations."
