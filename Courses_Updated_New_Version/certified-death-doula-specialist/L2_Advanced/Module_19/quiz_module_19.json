            "question": "According to research regarding the 'medicalization of death,' which of the following statistics best represents the gap between patient preference and reality in the United States?",
            "options": [
                "90% of people want to die in a hospital, but only 20% do.",
                "Approximately 70% of Americans express a desire to die at home, yet nearly 60% die in acute care or long-term care facilities.",
                "Only 10% of patients want to die at home, while 80% actually do.",
                "There is no statistically significant gap between where people want to die and where they actually die."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows a 'disconnect' in the clinical landscape: while the vast majority of patients prefer a home death, institutionalized death remains the statistical norm due to the medicalization of end-of-life care."

            "question": "A 2021 retrospective study on the impact of non-medical end-of-life support (doulas) found that their presence was most significantly correlated with which clinical outcome?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based studies indicate that doula support helps align care with patient wishes, which statistically leads to fewer aggressive, invasive interventions and lower ICU utilization at the end of life."

                "They stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to increase blood pressure.",
                "They promote a shift toward the parasympathetic nervous system, often resulting in lower cortisol levels and increased oxytocin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research into the science of comfort shows that sensory-based interventions can mitigate the 'fight or flight' response, reducing stress hormones and promoting a physiological state of calm."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Evidence shows that when ACP is clear, families experience significantly less psychological trauma because they are confident they are honoring the patient’s specific wishes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
