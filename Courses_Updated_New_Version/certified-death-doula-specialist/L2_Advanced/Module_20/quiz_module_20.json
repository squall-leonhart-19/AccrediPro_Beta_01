                "To ensure the doula is comfortable during the vigil",

                "To comply with OSHA workplace safety standards",
                "Sensory triggers have no clinical impact on the dying process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility is a dynamic process of self-reflection and learning that prioritizes the client as the expert of their own experience, rather than the doula 'mastering' a culture."
