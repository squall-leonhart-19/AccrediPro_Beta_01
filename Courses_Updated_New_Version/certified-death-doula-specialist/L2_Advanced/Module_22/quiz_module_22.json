            "question": "A client’s family asks the Death Doula to adjust the flow rate of an oxygen concentrator because the client seems to be struggling to breathe. What is the most ethically appropriate action according to the non-medical scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Adjust the oxygen flow as requested to provide immediate comfort.",
                "Teach the family how to adjust the flow so the doula isn't 'doing' it.",
                "Refuse to adjust the equipment and immediately contact the hospice nurse or medical provider.",
                "Check the client’s pulse oximetry first to see if the adjustment is necessary."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Death Doulas operate in a non-medical scope. Adjusting medical equipment or clinical flow rates is a medical task that falls outside the doula's professional boundaries and legal protections."

                "Self-care is a luxury that should only be practiced when all client needs are met.",
                "Neglecting self-care can lead to 'compassion fatigue,' which impairs the doula’s ability to provide safe, objective, and presence-based care.",

                "It is a legal requirement mandated by state licensing boards for all end-of-life practitioners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-care is an ethical duty because burnout and compassion fatigue can lead to poor decision-making, emotional over-involvement, or withdrawal, all of which harm the quality of care provided to the client."

                "Focus only on the physical needs of the client to avoid spiritual discussions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Financial transparency requires clear, written contracts that outline how fees are handled if services are terminated early due to death, ensuring the doula is paid for their availability while remaining fair to the estate."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A dual relationship occurs when a professional role and a personal role overlap. This can cloud judgment, create conflicts of interest, and make it difficult to maintain professional boundaries."
