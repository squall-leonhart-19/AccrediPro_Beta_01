            "question": "In a high-conflict family dynamic where 'triangulation' is occurring (family members using the doula to relay grievances to one another), what is the doula's most effective boundary-setting response?",
            "options": [
                "Relay the messages accurately to ensure everyone's voice is heard.",
                "Direct the family members to speak to each other directly while offering to facilitate the space.",
                "Take the side of the primary caregiver to maintain stability in the home.",
                "Report the family to social services for emotional volatility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To avoid being 'triangulated,' a doula must remain a neutral third party and encourage direct communication between family members, acting as a facilitator rather than a messenger."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A client with rapid-onset decline (e.g., fulminant hepatic failure) has approximately 48 hours of lucidity remaining. Which 'Compressed Legacy Work' intervention is most appropriate?",

                "Curating a 200-page bound autobiography.",
                "Organizing a multi-generational family reunion for next month.",

                "Conducting a deep-dive genealogy research project."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In rapid-onset cases, 'Micro-Legacy' work like audio recordings or an oral Ethical Will is prioritized due to the limited window of cognitive energy and time."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "When applying the SOLACE framework in a pediatric end-of-life case, what does the 'E' (Engagement) specifically focus on for the dying child?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the pediatric SOLACE application, Engagement focuses on the child's world—primarily through play, creative expression, and maintaining a sense of 'being a kid' despite the illness."

                "Making all comfort-care decisions on the client's behalf to save them effort."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-verbal advocacy requires the doula to honor the client's cognitive autonomy by using whatever communication system (blinks, boards, eye-tracking) was established before the client lost motor function."

            "id": "q16_5",

                "The doula must never touch, mix, or administer the lethal dose.",
                "The doula is responsible for disposing of any leftover medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Death Doula's role in MAiD is strictly non-medical and supportive. Touching or administering the medication can lead to legal prosecution and violates professional doula standards."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ritual design for syncretic families involves finding the 'golden thread' or shared symbols that honor the complexity of the client's spiritual identity without prioritizing one over the other."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In traumatic loss, the doula acts as a 'calm center,' focusing on Psychological First Aid—ensuring survivors are breathing, hydrated, and grounded before any complex planning occurs."

            "id": "q16_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To slow decomposition during a multi-day home vigil, the body (specifically the torso/organ area) must be kept at or below 40°F using dry ice or Techni-ice."

            "id": "q16_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is to facilitate education and advocacy. Reviewing the legal Advance Directive helps the family understand that VSED is a recognized, legal choice and that the client's wishes must be honored."
