            ],

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In an accelerated vigil, time is the scarcest resource. The Doula must prioritize the most critical environmental preferences and ensure the inner circle is present or notified."

                "Burnout happens suddenly; STS happens over many years",
                "Burnout is related to workplace environment and workload; STS is a reaction to the trauma of the clients themselves",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Doula is a neutral facilitator. Their role is to redirect the family toward the patient's stated or implied values rather than the family's personal fears or medical technicalities."
