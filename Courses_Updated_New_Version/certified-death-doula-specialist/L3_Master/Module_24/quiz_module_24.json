            "question": "In the context of 'The Master’s Stillness' (L1), what is the primary indicator that a Doula has moved from active listening to 'holding a resonant field'?",
            "options": [
                "The Doula provides immediate verbal affirmations to every patient statement.",
                "The Doula maintains a non-reactive presence that allows the client's emotional discharge to occur without interruption or 'fixing'.",
                "The Doula uses specific physical touch techniques to ground the patient during every interaction.",
                "The Doula actively directs the conversation toward legacy projects to distract from physical pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level presence involves 'The Master’s Stillness,' which is characterized by a non-reactive, grounded state that provides a safe container for the client's experience without the practitioner's need to intervene or comfort-seek."

            "question": "When deciphering the 'Subtle Language of Dying' (L2), a Master Doula observes 'mottling' beginning at the knees and feet. Based on clinical averages, what does this typically indicate regarding the timeline?",
            "options": [
                "Death is likely 7 to 10 days away.",
                "The patient is experiencing a temporary circulatory fluctuation unrelated to the dying process.",
                "The active dying phase has likely begun, with death often occurring within 24 to 48 hours.",
                "The patient is experiencing 'Terminal Lucidity' and will soon regain full consciousness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mottling (livedo reticularis) is a key physiological sign in the 'Subtle Language of Dying' that usually indicates the final 24-48 hours of life as peripheral circulation shuts down."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "In Master-Level Legacy Work (L3), the process of 'Narrative Repair' is specifically designed to help clients who:",
            "options": [
                "Have no living relatives to leave a legacy to.",
                "Are struggling with 'unfinished business' or fractured stories resulting from past trauma or estrangement.",
                "Wish to create a purely financial distribution plan for their estate.",
                "Are in a state of 'Agitated Delirium' and cannot communicate verbally."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative Repair is an advanced legacy technique used to help clients reframe and find meaning in difficult or 'broken' life stories, facilitating a sense of completion before death."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A Master Doula is navigating a 'High-Stakes Advocacy' (L4) scenario where a hospital's policy conflicts with a patient's legal Advanced Directive regarding VSED. What is the most effective first step for a Master Practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately threaten legal action against the hospital staff.",
                "Advise the family to remove the patient from the hospital against medical advice.",
                "Utilize 'Collaborative Inquiry' to ask the medical team how they plan to honor the legal directive within their policy framework.",
                "Remain silent to avoid overstepping the Doula's scope of practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-stakes advocacy requires navigating systemic obstacles through 'Collaborative Inquiry'—using strategic questioning to align medical staff with the patient’s rights without escalating unnecessary conflict."

            "question": "According to 'Integrative Comfort Care' (L5) guidelines, why is 'Comfort Touch' preferred over traditional massage therapy during the final 72 hours of life?",
            "options": [
                "Traditional massage is too expensive for most families.",
                "The body's ability to process deep tissue manipulation decreases, and skin becomes hypersensitive to pressure.",
                "Massage therapy requires a separate medical license that Doulas do not hold.",
                "Touch is discouraged during the active dying phase to prevent 'Terminal Restlessness'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the final stages, physiological changes make deep pressure uncomfortable or even painful; Master Doulas use 'Comfort Touch' (feather-light, stationary hand placement) to provide sensory support without overstimulation."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "During 'The Master Vigil' (L6), a patient experiences 'Terminal Lucidity' (a sudden surge of energy and clarity). How should the Master Doula manage this event?",

                "Administer extra sedation to ensure the patient doesn't exhaust themselves.",
                "Quietly facilitate meaningful connection while preventing environmental overstimulation that could lead to subsequent 'crash' delirium.",
                "Inform the family that the patient is likely recovering and will no longer need a vigil."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Terminal Lucidity is a sacred but fragile window. The Master Doula manages the environment to allow for connection while protecting the patient from the exhaustion that often follows this surge."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "In 'Ritual Architecture' (L7), the 'Liminal Phase' of a ceremony is best described as:",

                "The legal process of filing the death certificate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ritual Architecture utilizes the concept of liminality—the threshold state where transformation happens. Master Doulas design ceremonies that consciously 'hold' this space for the grieving."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "Under 'Professional Mastery' (L8), what is 'Vicarious Resilience' and how does it benefit the Master Doula?",
            "options": [
                "It is the ability to ignore the patient's pain to protect one's own mental health.",
                "It is a state of burnout caused by working with too many high-trauma cases.",
                "It is the positive psychological transformation a Doula experiences by witnessing the strength and healing of their clients.",
                "It is a technical term for a Doula's secondary insurance policy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vicarious Resilience is the 'flip side' of compassion fatigue; it is the professional growth and strength a Master Doula gains by being present for the profound healing and resilience shown by dying patients."

            "id": "q24_9",

                "Wet, gurgling sounds caused by secretions in the upper airway."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cheyne-Stokes is a specific rhythmic pattern of breathing followed by apnea, common in the final hours/days, which the Master Doula must identify and explain to the family to reduce anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "Which ethical principle from L8 is most critical when a Master Doula is asked by a family to perform a task that falls within the 'Medical Scope of Practice' (e.g., adjusting a morphine pump)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional Mastery requires 'Role Integrity.' Even if the Doula is capable or the family is stressed, a Master Doula never crosses into medical administration, as it violates the scope of practice and creates significant legal/ethical risk."
