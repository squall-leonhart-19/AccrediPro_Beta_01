            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for professional liability insurance.",
                "It separates personal assets from business liabilities, protecting the doula's home and savings from legal judgments.",
                "It allows the doula to practice medical interventions under a business shield.",
                "It guarantees a lower federal income tax rate regardless of earnings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LLC provides a 'corporate veil' that protects the owner's personal assets from being seized to pay business debts or legal settlements, which is critical in high-responsibility fields like death care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kickbacks can compromise the doula's integrity and the client's trust, as the referral is based on financial gain rather than the best fit for the family's needs."

                "To provide a script that must be read verbatim to every client.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Claims-made policies only cover claims filed while the policy is active. 'Tail' coverage extends the reporting period so that if a client sues years later for a past event, the doula is still protected."
