            "options": [
                "It allows the doula to charge the highest possible rates regardless of experience.",
                "It eliminates the need for professional liability insurance.",
                "It reduces marketing fatigue by focusing resources on a specific demographic, such as 'MAiD Support' or 'Green Burial Advocacy.'",
                "It is a legal requirement for business registration in most states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Defining a niche allows a practitioner to become a specialist, making marketing more efficient and helping them stand out in a generalist wellness market."

                "Non-Profit 501(c)(3)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LLC provides a 'corporate veil' that separates personal assets (like a home or personal savings) from business liabilities and lawsuits."

            "id": "q30_3",
            "question": "When applying the 'Sliding Scale' pricing strategy discussed in Lesson 3, what is the primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the doula never has to pay taxes on lower-income tiers.",
                "To maximize profit by charging every client the maximum they can afford.",
                "To increase accessibility for lower-income clients while maintaining a sustainable 'anchor' rate for the practice.",
                "To bypass the need for a formal service agreement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A sliding scale balances social equity with business sustainability, allowing those with fewer resources to access care while the 'anchor' or higher tiers support the doula's overhead."

            "options": [
                "80% personal life updates and 20% business services.",
                "80% educational and value-based content, and 20% promotional or 'sales' content.",
                "80% paid advertising and 20% organic posting.",
                "80% video content and 20% written blog posts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule builds trust; by providing value and education 80% of the time, the audience is more receptive when the doula promotes their services the other 20% of the time."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical networking is built on mutual value and education; 'kickbacks' or fee-splitting for referrals are generally considered unethical and, in some cases, illegal."

            "id": "q30_6",

                "Adjust it immediately, as comfort is the priority.",
                "Adjust it only if the family signs a waiver in that moment.",
                "Decline and explain that as a non-medical professional, you cannot adjust medical equipment, then assist the family in calling the hospice nurse.",
                "Leave the house immediately to avoid liability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas must strictly adhere to a non-medical scope of practice. Adjusting medical equipment like oxygen or morphine pumps is a clinical task that falls outside a doula's professional boundaries."

            "id": "q30_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses practice sustainability. What is a primary indicator that a doula is experiencing 'Compassion Fatigue'?",

                "Spending more time on administrative tasks than bedside care."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue often manifests as emotional withdrawal, numbness, or dread, signaling that the doula's 'empathy tank' is empty and they need to scale back."

        {
            "id": "q30_9",
            "question": "When scaling a practice (Lesson 8), why might a doula transition from 1-on-1 services to 'Group Offerings' like grief circles or death cafes?",
            "options": [
                "To avoid paying for business insurance.",
                "Because group work requires no preparation or curriculum.",
                "To leverage their time more effectively, serving more people at a lower price point while maintaining income.",
                "Because group work is the only way to legally provide grief support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Group offerings allow for 'one-to-many' scaling, which increases the doula's impact and income potential without increasing their bedside hours proportionally."

        {
            "id": "q30_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, why is 'Professional Liability Insurance' (Errors & Omissions) necessary for a non-medical Death Doula?",

                "It covers the client's medical bills if they are hospitalized.",
                "It protects the doula against claims of negligence, breach of contract, or emotional distress advice.",
                "It is a mandatory requirement for getting a driver's license.",
                "It guarantees the doula will never be sued."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Even non-medical professionals can be sued for 'errors' in advice or 'omissions' of critical support. Liability insurance provides a legal defense and financial protection in these cases."
