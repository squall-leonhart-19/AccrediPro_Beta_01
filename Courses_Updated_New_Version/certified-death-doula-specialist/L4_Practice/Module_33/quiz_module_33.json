            "question": "A client’s family asks you to adjust the flow rate on a morphine pump because the hospice nurse is delayed. Based on the 'Scope of Practice' (L1), what is the legally appropriate response?",
            "options": [
                "Adjust the pump only if you have prior nursing experience.",
                "Refuse and explain that as a non-medical professional, you cannot touch medical equipment or administer medication.",
                "Adjust the pump but document it as a 'family-directed action' in your notes.",
                "Call the physician directly to get verbal permission to adjust the pump."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Death Doulas operate within a non-medical scope. Manipulating medical equipment or administering medication constitutes practicing medicine without a license, regardless of prior experience or verbal permission."

                "Because doulas are technically considered 'Business Associates' under federal law in all 50 states.",
                "Because the doula is required to report all client interactions to the Department of Health.",
                "To prevent civil litigation based on 'breach of privacy' or 'intentional infliction of emotional distress.'",
                "Because HIPAA applies to any individual who enters a private residence for work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While doulas may not meet the federal definition of a 'covered entity' under HIPAA, they are still subject to state privacy laws and civil litigation if they breach a client's confidentiality or privacy."

                "To ensure the doula is paid even if they fail to show up for the vigil."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Limitation of Liability clauses are standard risk management tools that aim to limit the financial exposure of the doula in the event of a civil dispute or error."

            "explanation": "In all U.S. jurisdictions where MAiD is legal, the patient must self-administer the medication. A doula assisting in the physical administration could be charged with assisted suicide or homicide."

                "It is a requirement for all doulas to be named as executors.",
                "It allows the doula to bypass the probate process.",
                "It ensures the doula is paid for their services after the client passes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Accepting a fiduciary role or being a beneficiary creates a massive conflict of interest and leaves the doula vulnerable to legal challenges from the family regarding 'undue influence' over a vulnerable person."
