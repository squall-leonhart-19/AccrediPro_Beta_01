            "question": "Which of the following best defines the 'Scope of Advocacy' for a Death Doula when interacting with a medical team?",
            "options": [
                "Providing clinical interpretations of diagnostic test results to the family.",
                "Ensuring the patient's pre-stated wishes are heard and respected without providing medical advice.",
                "Directing the nursing staff on which palliative medications should be administered.",
                "Legally overriding a physician's DNR order if the family disagrees."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Death Doula's advocacy is non-medical and non-legal; the role is to amplify the client's voice and ensure their person-centered values remain the focus of the care plan."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client has a 'Living Will' but has not appointed a Healthcare Proxy. Why might this be a significant gap in their End-of-Life planning?",
            "options": [
                "A Living Will is only valid if the patient is currently conscious.",
                "Living Wills are not legally recognized in most states.",
                "A Living Will cannot account for every specific medical nuance, whereas a Proxy can make real-time decisions based on the situation.",
                "A Living Will only covers financial assets, not medical treatments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a Living Will outlines general preferences, a Healthcare Proxy (Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare) provides a person who can interpret those wishes in complex, unforeseen clinical scenarios."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "At what point does a Healthcare Power of Attorney (HCPOA) typically 'spring' into effect?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately upon the document being signed and notarized.",
                "Only after the client has been deceased for 24 hours.",
                "When a physician or clinical team determines the client lacks the 'capacity' to make their own decisions.",
                "When the Death Doula determines the client is too emotional to think clearly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Most Healthcare Proxies are 'springing,' meaning they only grant authority to the agent once the principal is deemed clinically unable to make or communicate their own choices."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "When designing a Vigil Plan, which 'sensory' consideration is often most critical for a client in the active dying phase who is experiencing terminal restlessness?",
            "options": [
                "Bright lighting to help the client stay oriented to the room.",
                "Continuous, upbeat conversation to keep the atmosphere positive.",
                "Low-stimulation environments with familiar 'anchor' scents or gentle touch as tolerated.",
                "Playing the client's favorite action movies at a high volume."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Terminal restlessness is often exacerbated by overstimulation. A Vigil Plan should focus on 'environmental titration'—reducing noise and light to create a peaceful, low-stress space."

            "options": [
                "The right to have a funeral director present at the home 24/7.",
                "The right to purchase a casket or urn from a third-party source without the funeral home charging an extra fee.",
                "The right to a free burial if the deceased was a community volunteer.",
                "The right to embalming, as it is federally mandated in all 50 states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FTC Funeral Rule allows consumers to buy goods (like caskets) from any source, and funeral homes are prohibited from charging a 'handling fee' for items purchased elsewhere."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "During a family meeting, two siblings are arguing over whether to continue artificial hydration for their unresponsive parent. What is the Doula's most ethical course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Side with the sibling who has the most logical medical argument.",
                "Advise the family on the statistical failure rates of artificial hydration.",
                "Facilitate communication by refocusing the family on the client's previously stated values and 'What Matters Most' to the patient.",
                "Make the final decision for the family to end the conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical advocacy involves neutrality and mediation. The Doula uses 'values-based' facilitation to help the family align their decisions with the patient's known wishes."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "When organizing an 'End-of-Life Binder,' why is it important to include a 'Digital Legacy' section?",
            "options": [
                "To store the client's social media passwords for the Doula to use later.",
                "To ensure executors can access encrypted files, close accounts, and preserve digital photos or intellectual property.",
                "It is a legal requirement for probate in every state.",
                "So the Doula can manage the client's bank accounts after death."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital assets are often overlooked. A 'Digital Legacy' section ensures that survivors have the necessary access to handle the deceased's online life and digital property."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A Doula notices that the medical team is using jargon that the family clearly does not understand. Which technique should the Doula use to advocate effectively?",
            "options": [
                "Interrupt the doctor to explain the term yourself.",
                "Ask the doctor: 'Could you explain that in simpler terms for us, or perhaps use an analogy?'",
                "Tell the family to ignore the doctor because they are being elitist.",
                "Wait until the doctor leaves and then provide a medical definition from Wikipedia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective advocacy involves 'modeling' communication. By asking the doctor to clarify, the Doula empowers the family to ask questions and ensures accurate information is delivered by the medical professional."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Funeral Advocacy,' what is a 'Green Burial'?",

                "Any burial that takes place in a forest regardless of the chemicals used.",
                "A burial where the family pays a 'carbon offset' fee to the funeral home."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Green or natural burial focuses on environmental sustainability, utilizing biodegradable materials and eschewing toxic embalming fluids and non-biodegradable vaults."

                "Write the document for them but don't sign your name to it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Drafting legal documents constitutes the 'Unauthorized Practice of Law' (UPL). Doulas can facilitate the *discussion* of wishes, but the *drafting* of legal instruments must be done by the client or a legal professional."
