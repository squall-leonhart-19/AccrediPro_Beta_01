            "question": "In the 'companioning' model of care, which is a hallmark of the Death Doula's role, what is the primary objective when sitting with a dying client?",
            "options": [
                "To provide clinical interventions that alleviate physical symptoms",
                "To remain present with the person's soul without the need to 'fix' or 'cure'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Companioning, as defined in Lesson 1, focuses on 'being' rather than 'doing.' It is about witnessing the experience and holding space for the person's transition without trying to eliminate the natural process of dying."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 70/30 rule emphasizes that the doula should be listening for 70% of the interaction, allowing the client to lead the narrative and express their needs fully."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nearing-Death Awareness often involves symbolic language, frequently using metaphors of travel or preparation. Doulas are trained to validate these expressions rather than correcting them."

                "It prevents the doula from being able to accept payment for services"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rescuer's Trap occurs when a doula tries to fix the client's pain to ease their own discomfort, which ultimately strips the client of their own process and autonomy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue is the 'cost of caring' and often has a more rapid onset than burnout, specifically triggered by the emotional absorption of others' trauma and suffering."
