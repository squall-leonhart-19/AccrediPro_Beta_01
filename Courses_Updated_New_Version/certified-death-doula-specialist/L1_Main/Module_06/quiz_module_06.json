            "question": "A client is experiencing Cheyne-Stokes respirations. Which description best defines this physiological pattern during the active dying phase?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, shallow breathing consistently above 30 breaths per minute",
                "Deep, labored gasping known as 'air hunger' or dyspnea",
                "Periods of apnea followed by a gradual increase and then decrease in breathing depth",
                "Wet, gurgling sounds caused by the accumulation of oropharyngeal secretions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cheyne-Stokes respiration is characterized by a rhythmic cycle of apnea (stopped breathing) followed by crescendo-decrescendo breathing patterns, indicating the brain stem's decreasing sensitivity to CO2."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "When observing mottling (livedo reticularis) in a dying client, where does this purple/bluish marble-like pattern typically appear first?",
            "options": [
                "The feet, knees, and ankles",
                "The fingertips and earlobes",
                "The lower back and sacrum",
                "The abdomen and chest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mottling usually begins at the most peripheral points of circulation—the feet and knees—due to the body's attempt to shunt blood toward vital organs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A client is exhibiting terminal restlessness, picking at their bedsheets and attempting to climb out of bed despite extreme weakness. What is the Doula's primary non-pharmacological priority?",
            "options": [
                "Physically restraining the client to prevent a fall",
                "Increasing the room's lighting and playing upbeat music to re-orient them",
                "Creating a low-stimulus environment and using a calm, grounding voice",
                "Encouraging the family to loudly remind the client of the current date and time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Terminal restlessness is often exacerbated by sensory overload. A low-stimulus environment and a calm, non-anxious presence help reduce agitation without the need for physical restraint."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "According to the concept of Nearing Death Awareness (NDA), if a client speaks about 'needing to find my tickets' or 'waiting for the train,' how should the Doula respond?",
            "options": [
                "Correct the client by stating they are in a bed and not at a station",
                "Validate the metaphor and ask if they have everything they need for the journey",
                "Immediately notify the nurse that the client is experiencing a psychotic break",
                "Ignore the comments as they are merely a side effect of medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NDA often involves symbolic language regarding travel. Validating these metaphors supports the client's internal processing of the transition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "What is the recommended timeframe for 'The Pause' immediately following the final breath?",
            "options": [
                "30 seconds to confirm the heart has stopped",
                "At least 60 minutes before touching the body",
                "Typically 5 to 20 minutes of silence to honor the threshold crossing",
                "There is no recommended pause; the funeral home should be called immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Pause' is a sacred window (often 5-20 minutes) that allows the energy of the room to settle and the family to witness the transition before the 'business' of death begins."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "When performing initial after-death body care, why is it critical to position the body (closing eyes and mouth) within the first 1 to 2 hours?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the spread of infectious diseases",
                "Because rigor mortis (stiffening of the muscles) begins to set in",
                "To ensure the body remains at a specific temperature",
                "Legal regulations require all positioning to be finished within 60 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rigor mortis typically begins within 2-4 hours after death. Positioning the body early ensures a peaceful appearance that is harder to achieve once the muscles stiffen."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "During the vigil, the 'death rattle' (terminal secretions) occurs. What is the most effective non-drug intervention the Doula can suggest to the caregivers?",
            "options": [
                "Deep oropharyngeal suctioning with a machine",
                "Encouraging the client to drink small sips of water",
                "Repositioning the client onto their side (lateral recumbent)",
                "Administering a high-flow oxygen mask"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Repositioning the client on their side allows gravity to move secretions, often quieting the sound. Suctioning is generally avoided as it is invasive and often increases secretion production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a clinical sign that death has occurred that a Doula can observe (without performing a medical pronouncement)?",
            "options": [
                "A drop in body temperature below 95 degrees",
                "The presence of 'fixed and dilated' pupils that do not react to light",
                "The skin turning a bright yellow color (jaundice)",
                "A sudden increase in muscle tension across the jaw"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fixed, dilated pupils that do not respond to light, along with the absence of pulse and breath, are standard clinical signs that the physical body has ceased to function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'The Doula’s Exit,' what is the primary purpose of a 'Closure Ritual' for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the family provides a positive testimonial",
                "To collect final payment before leaving the home",
                "To energetically and emotionally separate from the case and prevent burnout",
                "To provide the family with a list of local therapists"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A closure ritual (like washing hands, a prayer, or a moment of silence) helps the Doula process the experience and maintain professional boundaries by leaving the 'weight' of the death behind."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "A family is hesitant to touch the body of their loved one after death. How should the Doula facilitate this transition?",
            "options": [
                "Insist that they touch the body to achieve 'closure'",
                "Model the behavior by touching the deceased's hand gently while speaking to them",
                "Call the funeral home immediately to remove the body and reduce family distress",
                "Leave the room to give the family privacy until they decide what to do"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modeling gentle, natural touch helps demystify the dead body and gives the family permission to interact with their loved one at their own pace."
