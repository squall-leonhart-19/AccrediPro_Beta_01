            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in S.O.L.A.C.E. stands for Observational Assessment, which involves a holistic evaluation of the client's environment, including sensory inputs and the emotional 'climate' of the room."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Holding space is the practice of being physically, emotionally, and spiritually present for someone without judgment, allowing them to lead their own journey without the doula attempting to fix or change their experience."

                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same document.",
                "An Ethical Will is required by law in most states, while a Living Will is optional."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Burnout is caused by the client; Vicarious Trauma is caused by the doula's family.",

                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable in professional practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout is generally a reaction to environmental stress or overwork. Vicarious trauma is a deeper psychological 'transformation' that occurs when a practitioner internalizes the trauma or pain of their clients."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "There is a significant 'death gap' where roughly 80% of individuals wish to die at home, but due to lack of support or planning, only a small minority actually achieve a home death."

            "id": "q11_10",

            "explanation": "Mottling (bluish/purple marble-like skin) is a natural sign of the body's circulatory system shutting down and is usually not a sign of pain, but rather a sign that death is approaching (typically within hours or days)."
