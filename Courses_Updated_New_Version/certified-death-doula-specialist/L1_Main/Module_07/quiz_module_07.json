            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "A client in the active dying phase exhibits a breathing pattern characterized by periods of apnea followed by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing. What is the clinical term for this, and what is the doula's role?",
            "options": [
                "Kussmaul breathing; the doula should recommend immediate oxygen administration.",
                "Cheyne-Stokes respiration; the doula should reassure the family that this is a normal physiological process.",
                "Agonal gasping; the doula should perform a sternal rub to stimulate the respiratory drive.",
                "Stridor; the doula should reposition the client to a prone position immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a common sign of active dying. The doula's role is to normalize the experience for the family, explaining that it is a natural part of the body's transition and generally not a sign of distress for the patient."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "When observing mottling (livedo reticularis) during the active dying phase, where does this discoloration typically manifest first?",
            "options": [
                "The face and earlobes",
                "The abdomen and lower back",
                "The feet, knees, and underside of the legs",
                "The fingertips and nail beds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mottling usually begins at the distal extremities, specifically the feet and knees, due to decreased peripheral circulation as the body prioritizes blood flow to vital organs."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A family member arrives from out of state and immediately begins questioning the hospice nurse's medication dosages and the doula's environmental choices. This is a classic example of which family dynamic archetype?",
            "options": [
                "The Gatekeeper",
                "The Hero (or The Fixer)",
                "The Distant One",
                "The Rescuer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Hero' or 'Fixer' archetype often arrives late in the process and attempts to take control or 'fix' the situation to alleviate their own guilt or feelings of helplessness regarding the impending death."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "During the 'Golden Hour' immediately following the moment of death, what is the doula's primary responsibility regarding the environment?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately calling the funeral home to arrange transport.",
                "Removing all medical equipment and tubes as quickly as possible.",
                "Holding a 'sacred pause' of silence and preventing a rush to action.",
                "Beginning the formal washing of the body within the first 10 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Hour' is a period of sacred stillness. The doula's role is to protect this space, allowing the family to process the reality of the death without the immediate intrusion of clinical or administrative tasks."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "According to the SOLACE Cycle™ methodology for the doula's exit, what does the 'A' represent?",

                "Analyze the medical records for the final report"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the SOLACE Cycle, 'A' stands for Acknowledging the Transition. This involves validating the family’s experience and the sacred work they have done as caregivers before the doula exits the space."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "When performing sacred after-death body care, what is the recommended technique for ensuring the eyes remain closed if they do not stay shut naturally?",
            "options": [
                "Using surgical adhesive or superglue",
                "Placing lightly moistened cotton balls or small weights (like coins) over the lids for a short period",
                "Applying heavy pressure to the globes for 5 minutes",
                "Taping the eyelids shut with transparent medical tape"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle, non-invasive methods are preferred in sacred after-death care. Moistened cotton balls provide enough weight and moisture to help the eyelids set naturally without damaging the delicate tissue."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "In the context of green burials, what is the standard depth for the grave to ensure optimal aerobic decomposition?",
            "options": [
                "The traditional 'six feet under'",
                "Approximately 3 to 4 feet deep",
                "At least 8 feet deep to prevent animal scavenging",
                "12 inches deep to maximize sun exposure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Green burials typically occur at a depth of 3 to 4 feet (the 'smell barrier' and 'biologically active' zone), where oxygen and soil microbes can most efficiently break down the body."

        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a non-pharmacological comfort measure specifically used to address 'Terminal Congestion' (the death rattle)?",
            "options": [
                "Vigorous suctioning of the oropharynx",
                "Encouraging the patient to drink more fluids",
                "Positioning the patient in a side-lying (lateral) position",
                "Applying a cold compress to the throat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Side-lying positioning helps gravity drain secretions and often reduces the sound of congestion. Suctioning is generally avoided as it is invasive and can cause distress/increased secretion production."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Rigor mortis, the stiffening of the joints and muscles, typically begins to set in within which timeframe after death?",

                "24 to 48 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rigor mortis usually begins within 2 to 4 hours after death, starting with the smaller muscles of the face and jaw. This is why doulas recommend closing the mouth and eyes early in the after-death care process."

            "question": "Under the FTC Funeral Rule, which of the following is a legal right that a Death Doula should help families understand during home funeral planning?",
            "options": [
                "Families are legally required to use a funeral director for all paperwork.",
                "Funeral homes must accept a casket or container provided by the family without charging an extra fee.",
                "Embalming is federally mandated for all bodies held at home for more than 24 hours.",
                "Cremation cannot take place without a professional funeral director's signature in all 50 states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FTC Funeral Rule mandates that funeral providers cannot charge a 'handling fee' if a family provides their own casket or urn, which is a key piece of information for families opting for home-based or DIY funeral elements."
