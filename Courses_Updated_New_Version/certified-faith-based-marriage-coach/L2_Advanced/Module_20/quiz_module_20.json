            "question": "According to the principles of Faith-Based Marriage Assessment (L1), which of the following is the primary ethical consideration when integrating spiritual guidance with professional coaching practices?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the coach's theological perspective perfectly aligns with the clients'.",
                "Maintaining client autonomy and avoiding imposing religious beliefs.",
                "Prioritizing spiritual interventions over evidence-based psychological strategies.",
                "Exclusively working with clients who share the coach's specific faith denomination."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining client autonomy and avoiding the imposition of religious beliefs is paramount in ethical faith-based coaching. While spiritual integration is valuable, it must always respect the clients' agency and belief system, rather than seeking perfect alignment, prioritizing one intervention type, or limiting clients based on denomination."

            "question": "During the Initial Client Intake & Screening process (L2), a coach observes that one partner consistently minimizes the other's concerns and frequently interrupts. Which of the following 'red flags' does this most directly indicate, requiring further assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of shared spiritual values.",
                "Potential for passive-aggressive communication.",
                "Evidence of contempt or criticism.",
                "Difficulty in establishing collaborative goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Minimizing concerns and frequent interruptions are strong indicators of contempt and criticism, two of Gottman's 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,' which are significant predictors of marital distress and require immediate attention in assessment. While passive-aggression might be present, the directness of the observed behaviors points more strongly to criticism/contempt."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A couple reports that during disagreements, one partner typically withdraws emotionally and physically, while the other escalates their demands for resolution. Based on L3: Assessing Communication Patterns & Conflict Resolution, what classic conflict pattern does this scenario most clearly illustrate?",
            "options": [
                "Mutual avoidance.",
                "Criticism-defensiveness cycle.",
                "Stonewalling-contempt dynamic.",
                "Demand-withdraw pattern."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The demand-withdraw pattern is characterized by one partner pressing for discussion, engagement, or change (the demander), while the other disengages, avoids, or becomes silent (the withdrawer). This is a common and often destructive communication pattern in marital conflict."

            "question": "In evaluating Intimacy & Connection (L4), a couple expresses that they pray together regularly and attend church, but feel emotionally distant and rarely share personal vulnerabilities. Which aspect of intimacy requires the most immediate focus for assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Physical intimacy, as it's often linked to emotional connection.",
                "Spiritual intimacy, to deepen their shared faith practices.",
                "Emotional intimacy, focusing on vulnerability and self-disclosure.",
                "Recreational intimacy, to increase shared activities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While spiritual practices are present, the core issue is the lack of emotional vulnerability and self-disclosure, indicating a deficit in emotional intimacy. Emotional intimacy is crucial for a deep connection, even when spiritual and other forms of intimacy are present."

                "The division of labor and responsibilities within the current household."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Genograms are powerful tools for mapping family structures and identifying recurring intergenerational patterns related to relationships, communication styles, conflict resolution, mental health, and significant life events, providing context for current marital dynamics."

            "options": [
                "It guarantees a successful marriage by identifying all potential issues.",
                "It provides a structured framework for discussing key relationship areas and potential growth points.",
                "It replaces the need for the coach's professional judgment and interpretation.",
                "It primarily assesses individual compatibility based on personality types."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardized tools like SYMBIS (Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts) offer a structured, evidence-based framework to explore various dimensions of a relationship (e.g., communication, finances, roles, spirituality), facilitating guided discussions and identifying areas for growth and deeper understanding, rather than guaranteeing outcomes or replacing professional judgment."

            "question": "After collecting data from intake, interviews, and a communication assessment, a coach notices a consistent theme: both partners feel unheard and misunderstood, despite expressing their needs. In Synthesizing Assessment Data (L7), what is the most appropriate next step for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately recommend a specific communication technique.",
                "Formulate a hypothesis about underlying fears or attachment injuries contributing to this pattern.",
                "Dismiss the data as contradictory, as both can't be 'unheard'.",
                "Suggest individual therapy for each partner to address their personal issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesizing data involves identifying patterns and formulating hypotheses about their root causes. The shared feeling of being unheard points to deeper underlying issues, possibly related to attachment injuries or unmet core needs, which should be explored before jumping to solutions or dismissing findings."

            "options": [
                "The coach should present a detailed, expert-driven action plan for the couple to follow.",
                "The findings should be presented in a way that highlights one partner's greater responsibility for issues.",
                "Goals should be co-created with the couple, making them specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).",
                "The coach should focus solely on past failures to emphasize the need for change."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collaborative goal setting involves working with the couple to define goals that are meaningful and achievable for them. Utilizing the SMART goal framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) ensures clarity and increases the likelihood of client commitment and success."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Case Study Application: John and Mary, married for 15 years, present with a lack of emotional intimacy. Mary feels John doesn't share his feelings, while John feels Mary constantly criticizes his attempts. During assessment, the coach observes John often retreats to his 'man cave' after work, and Mary frequently initiates discussions about their relationship problems. Based on L3 and L4, what is the most likely interplay of assessment findings?",
            "options": [
                "John's withdrawal is a sign of disinterest, and Mary's criticism is a sign of contempt.",
                "Mary's criticism triggers John's defensiveness/stonewalling, creating a demand-withdraw cycle that hinders emotional intimacy.",
                "Both partners are exhibiting signs of passive-aggressive behavior, requiring individual therapy.",
                "Their issues are purely spiritual, and deeper prayer together will resolve the conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This scenario strongly suggests a demand-withdraw pattern, where Mary's attempts to connect (often perceived as criticism by John) lead to John's withdrawal (defensiveness/stonewalling). This cycle actively erodes emotional intimacy and is a common dynamic identified in communication assessments."

            "question": "A coach is reviewing assessment data and identifies that a couple consistently struggles with financial disagreements, often rooted in differing beliefs about saving versus spending, which align with their distinct family-of-origin financial scripts. Which core theme, as discussed in L7: Synthesizing Assessment Data, is most evident here?",
            "options": [
                "Incompatible love languages.",
                "Unresolved individual trauma.",
                "Conflicting core values and family-of-origin influences.",
                "Lack of shared recreational activities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The scenario points to deep-seated issues stemming from conflicting core values (saving vs. spending) that are further reinforced by their family-of-origin financial scripts. These intergenerational patterns and value differences often form core themes in marital conflict and require comprehensive understanding."
