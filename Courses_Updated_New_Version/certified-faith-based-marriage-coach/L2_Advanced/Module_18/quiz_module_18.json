            "options": [
                "It primarily focuses on spiritual disciplines, with skills as secondary.",
                "It uses scriptural narratives to exclusively replace psychological techniques.",
                "It systematically weaves spiritual truths into each component (Communication, Openness, Vision, Empathy, Nurturing, Accountability, Trust) to inform and empower practical skill development.",
                "It segregates faith principles from practical advice to avoid confusion."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The COVENANT framework is designed to integrate spiritual truths directly into practical skills for a truly holistic and faith-informed approach, rather than separating or prioritizing one over the other exclusively.

            "question": "A client, 'Sarah,' consistently minimizes her role in marital conflicts and expresses significant skepticism about the coaching process, often stating, 'My husband just needs to change.'
