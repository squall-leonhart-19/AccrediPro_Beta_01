            "question": "Which of the following is NOT typically considered a foundational ethical principle in professional faith-based marriage coaching, as outlined by professional codes?",
            "options": [
                "Beneficence (acting in the client's best interest)",
                "Non-maleficence (doing no harm)",
                "Autonomy (respecting client's self-determination)",
                "Dogmatism (imposing one's beliefs rigidly)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Dogmatism, or the rigid imposition of one's beliefs, directly contradicts the ethical principle of client autonomy and respect for their individual journey, which is foundational in ethical coaching practice. The other options are core ethical principles."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "A client discloses during a faith-based marriage coaching session that their spouse is physically abusing one of their minor children. According to ethical guidelines, legal mandates (e.g., mandatory reporting laws in many jurisdictions), and the limits of confidentiality, what is the coach's primary obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain absolute confidentiality to protect the coaching relationship.",
                "Encourage the client to seek legal counsel and report the abuse themselves.",
                "Immediately assess the risk and report the abuse to child protective services or relevant authorities.",
                "Confront the abusive spouse directly to stop the behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mandatory reporting laws supersede confidentiality when there is a risk of harm to a minor. The coach has a legal and ethical obligation to report suspected child abuse to the appropriate authorities, ensuring the safety of the child is paramount."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach is approached by a couple from their church's small group, where the coach also serves as a lay leader, requesting coaching services. What is the most ethical course of action to avoid a dual relationship and maintain professional boundaries?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with coaching, as the existing relationship will foster deeper trust.",
                "Decline the coaching service and provide a referral to another qualified, objective coach.",
                "Offer coaching but waive the fees, as they are part of the same community.",
                "Coach them but only on non-spiritual matters to compartmentalize the relationship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Accepting coaching clients from an existing social or community circle creates a dual relationship, which can impair objectivity, create conflicts of interest, and blur professional boundaries. The most ethical approach is to decline and offer a referral to ensure client protection and professional integrity."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "During a coaching session, a client reveals persistent suicidal ideation with a specific, imminent plan. The coach's primary responsibility, considering their <span class=\"highlight\">scope of practice</span> as a coach, is to:",
            "options": [
                "Offer spiritual guidance and prayer, focusing on hope and faith.",
                "Coach them on positive affirmations and coping strategies within the session.",
                "Immediately assess the level of risk and facilitate an urgent referral to a licensed mental health professional or emergency services.",
                "Schedule an emergency session with their spouse to involve them in the safety plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Suicidal ideation with a plan falls outside the scope of practice for most coaches and constitutes a mental health crisis. The ethical and professional obligation is to prioritize client safety by referring immediately to qualified mental health professionals or emergency services, as coaches are not trained to provide crisis intervention or therapy for severe mental health conditions."

            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "Which of the following elements is MOST crucial to include in a comprehensive <span class=\"highlight\">informed consent</span> agreement for faith-based marriage coaching, ensuring transparency and client autonomy?",
            "options": [
                "A detailed list of all specific coaching techniques and exercises that will be used.",
                "The coach's personal testimony and spiritual journey.",
                "A clear outline of fees, session duration, confidentiality limits (including mandatory reporting), and the client's rights and responsibilities.",
                "A guarantee of positive marital outcomes if the coach's instructions are followed diligently."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Comprehensive informed consent requires full transparency regarding the practical aspects of the coaching relationship, including financial arrangements, session logistics, the boundaries of confidentiality, and the client's inherent rights. This empowers clients to make autonomous decisions about engaging in coaching. Guarantees of outcomes are unethical and unrealistic."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach holds a strong theological belief that divorce is never permissible, while their clients are exploring separation due to long-standing, irreconcilable differences. Ethically, the coach should:",
            "options": [
                "Gently guide the couple away from divorce based on their shared faith principles.",
                "Refer the couple to a coach whose values align more closely with the clients' current considerations.",
                "Disclose their personal values on divorce and assess if they can maintain objectivity and respect the clients' autonomy without imposing their beliefs.",
                "Terminate the coaching relationship immediately if their values conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While referring is an option, the primary ethical step when values differ is to first acknowledge the potential conflict. The coach must disclose their personal values and honestly assess their ability to remain objective and uphold client autonomy without imposing their own beliefs. If objectivity cannot be maintained, then a referral is necessary. Terminating immediately without assessment may not always be in the client's best interest."

            "question": "A client consistently describes their spouse as controlling, isolating them from friends and family, constantly monitoring their communications, and frequently demeaning their intelligence and worth. While there's no physical violence, these behaviors align with indicators of:",
            "options": [
                "Normal marital disagreements and boundary issues.",
                "Healthy boundary setting by a concerned spouse.",
                "Emotional and psychological abuse.",
                "A temporary phase of stress that will likely pass."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The described behaviors – control, isolation, monitoring, and demeaning – are classic indicators of emotional and psychological abuse. Ethical coaches must be trained to recognize these patterns, even in the absence of physical violence, and respond appropriately to ensure client safety and well-being, including potential referral to specialized domestic abuse services."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "When faced with an ethical dilemma in faith-based marriage coaching, such as a client disclosing information that borders on a breach of confidentiality but doesn't meet mandatory reporting criteria, which step is paramount in an ethical decision-making model (e.g., ETHIC or FORGE)?",
            "options": [
                "Act immediately based on gut feeling and personal moral compass.",
                "Consult with a trusted supervisor, mentor, or peer for guidance and perspective.",
                "Focus solely on the client's immediate desires and preferences.",
                "Ignore the dilemma if it's not clear-cut, assuming no harm will come."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consultation with a supervisor, mentor, or trusted peer is a critical step in ethical decision-making models. It provides an opportunity to gain an objective perspective, explore different ethical frameworks, and consider potential consequences, thus strengthening the coach's ability to make a sound and ethical decision."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach is conducting virtual sessions with clients across different states. To ensure client <span class=\"highlight\">confidentiality and privacy</span> in the digital space, the coach should primarily prioritize:",
            "options": [
                "Using a free, publicly available video conferencing tool for ease of access and cost savings.",
                "Recording all sessions for future review without explicit client consent to track progress.",
                "Utilizing end-to-end encrypted, HIPAA-compliant (or equivalent data privacy standard) platforms and secure data storage solutions.",
                "Sharing session links and client notes via unsecured email for convenience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In digital coaching, securing client data is paramount. Using encrypted, privacy-compliant platforms and secure storage protects sensitive information from unauthorized access, aligning with ethical duties of confidentiality and privacy. Unsecured platforms or communications pose significant risks."

            "question": "A coach owns a successful Christian bookstore and offers their coaching clients a 20% discount on all books purchased there, often recommending specific titles during sessions. This scenario presents a potential <span class=\"highlight\">conflict of interest</span> primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "It's good marketing for their bookstore business and benefits clients with a discount.",
                "It might create a perception of obligation for clients to purchase books, blurring the professional boundary and potentially exploiting the power differential.",
                "The discount is not significant enough to be considered a true conflict.",
                "It demonstrates the coach's commitment to providing valuable faith-based resources."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This situation creates a potential conflict of interest because the coach stands to gain financially from client purchases. The power dynamic in a coaching relationship can lead clients to feel obligated to buy, undermining their autonomy and potentially exploiting their trust. Ethical practice requires avoiding situations where personal gain could influence professional judgment or client decisions."
