            "question": "During an initial assessment, a faith-based marriage coach uncovers evidence of ongoing severe emotional abuse, including threats of physical harm, from one spouse towards the other. What is the coach's immediate ethical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the abused spouse to pray for their partner's change of heart.",
                "Facilitate a direct confrontation between the spouses about the abuse.",
                "Prioritize the safety of the abused spouse and provide resources for professional intervention and support.",
                "Advise the couple to seek immediate marital reconciliation through forgiveness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In cases of severe abuse or threats of harm, the coach's primary ethical responsibility is to ensure the safety of the abused client. This often necessitates immediate referral to licensed mental health professionals, domestic violence resources, or legal counsel, as these situations fall outside the scope of marriage coaching and require specialized intervention (L1: Ethical Boundaries)."

            "question": "In the aftermath of infidelity, a common initial stage for the betrayed spouse is characterized by intense emotional dysregulation, shock, and questioning their entire reality. According to established models of infidelity recovery, what is the primary focus for the coach during this 'crisis' stage?",
            "options": [
                "Guiding the couple through immediate forgiveness and reconciliation protocols.",
                "Facilitating detailed disclosure of all infidelity specifics to ensure transparency.",
                "Helping the betrayed spouse stabilize emotionally and establish safety and boundaries.",
                "Focusing on the offending spouse's repentance and spiritual renewal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'crisis' stage following infidelity is highly volatile. The immediate focus for the coach must be on helping the betrayed spouse achieve emotional stabilization, process the initial shock, and establish clear boundaries to feel safe. Detailed disclosure and reconciliation efforts typically come after this initial stabilization (L2: Navigating the Aftermath of Infidelity and Betrayal)."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A spouse is struggling with a gambling addiction that has led to significant financial distress and trust issues in the marriage. The non-addicted spouse frequently covers their partner's debts and makes excuses for their absence. Which of the following best describes the non-addicted spouse's behavior in this context?",
            "options": [
                "Demonstrating unconditional love and support.",
                "Implementing healthy boundaries to protect the marriage.",
                "Engaging in enabling behaviors that inadvertently perpetuate the addiction cycle.",
                "Practicing spiritual forbearance and patience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Covering debts, making excuses, or shielding an addicted person from the natural consequences of their actions are classic examples of enabling behaviors. While often well-intentioned, enabling prevents the addicted individual from facing the reality of their situation, thus perpetuating the addiction cycle (L3: Addressing Addiction and its Impact on Marital Health)."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client consistently reports feeling confused, questioning their own memory of events, and being told by their spouse that their perceptions are 'crazy' or 'never happened,' despite clear recollections. This pattern, often used to exert power and control, is a hallmark of what abusive dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "Constructive criticism.",
                "Healthy marital disagreement.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where an abuser attempts to make the victim doubt their own memory, perception, or sanity. This is a severe form of emotional abuse and a critical red flag for coaches (L4: Coaching Through Emotional, Verbal, and Spiritual Abuse Dynamics)."

            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach is working with a couple where one spouse has been diagnosed with severe Bipolar I Disorder. During a session, this spouse begins exhibiting signs of a manic episode, including rapid speech, grandiose delusions, and agitation. What is the most appropriate action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Attempt to de-escalate the episode using spiritual grounding techniques.",
                "Immediately refer the individual to a licensed mental health professional for crisis intervention and medical management.",
                "Continue the session, focusing on marital communication strategies.",
                "Advise the other spouse to pray more diligently for their partner's healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A coach's scope of practice does not include diagnosing or treating severe mental health crises. Signs of a manic episode, especially with delusions and agitation, require immediate professional medical and psychiatric intervention. The coach's role is to ensure safety and facilitate appropriate referral (L5: Supporting Marriages Impacted by Mental Health Challenges)."

            "question": "According to Dr. John Gottman's extensive research on marital dissolution, which of the 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' is considered the most potent predictor of divorce and is characterized by an attitude of superiority, disrespect, and disdain?",
            "options": [
                "Criticism",
                "Defensiveness",

                "Contempt"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Dr. Gottman identifies Contempt as the most destructive of the 'Four Horsemen.' It involves seeing one's partner as inferior, expressing disdain, and is corrosive to admiration and respect, making reconciliation extremely difficult (L6: De-escalating High Conflict and Contemptuous Relationships)."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A couple seeks coaching because their differing religious practices are causing significant conflict, particularly regarding their children's spiritual upbringing. One spouse is a devout Christian, the other an agnostic. Which coaching strategy is most aligned with fostering marital health in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the agnostic spouse to convert for the sake of marital unity.",
                "Helping the couple identify shared core values and areas of mutual respect for each other's beliefs.",
                "Advising them to avoid discussing religion to prevent conflict.",
                "Suggesting the children attend both religious and secular services to choose later."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In cases of faith disparity, a coach should avoid advocating for conversion. Instead, the focus should be on helping the couple find common ground in their core values (e.g., integrity, kindness, service) and foster mutual respect and understanding for each other's spiritual paths. This allows for unity without requiring uniformity (L7: Navigating Faith Disparity and Spiritual Crises in Marriage)."

            "question": "After discovering her husband had secretly accumulated $50,000 in credit card debt without her knowledge, a client feels deeply betrayed. What is the immediate foundational step a faith-based marriage coach should guide the couple through to begin addressing this financial infidelity?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately creating a strict budget and debt repayment plan.",
                "Encouraging the betrayed spouse to forgive unconditionally.",
                "Facilitating full, transparent disclosure of all financial secrets and a commitment to ongoing transparency.",
                "Focusing solely on the spiritual implications of poor stewardship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Financial infidelity, much like sexual infidelity, shatters trust. The immediate foundational step is facilitating complete and honest disclosure of all financial secrets, followed by a firm commitment to future transparency. Without this, any practical financial planning will lack the necessary relational foundation (L8: Intervening in Cases of Financial Infidelity and Severe Debt)."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "During an intake session, a client reveals their spouse controls all finances, isolates them from friends and family, and dictates their daily schedule. The client also mentions feeling constantly 'monitored' and afraid of their spouse's unpredictable anger. These patterns are significant red flags indicating the presence of:",
            "options": [
                "Healthy marital boundaries.",
                "A spouse with strong leadership qualities.",
                "A power and control dynamic indicative of abuse.",
                "A need for better communication skills training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The described behaviors—controlling finances, isolation, dictating schedules, monitoring, and fear—are classic indicators of coercive control and an abusive power dynamic. These are not issues resolvable by communication skills alone and demand a focus on safety and potential referral (L1: Ethical Boundaries & Assessment, L4: Coaching Through Emotional, Verbal, and Spiritual Abuse Dynamics)."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "Following an affair, the offending spouse expresses profound guilt and shame, leading to a spiritual crisis where they question their faith and worthiness. How should a faith-based coach best support this spouse while also addressing the marital recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Instruct them to focus solely on earning back their spouse's trust before addressing personal spiritual issues.",
                "Encourage them to confess their sins to a religious leader and seek immediate absolution.",
                "Guide them to reconcile their actions with their faith, emphasizing repentance, grace, and the journey of spiritual restoration, alongside practical steps for marital repair.",
                "Advise them that spiritual healing is secondary to marital healing and should be postponed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A faith-based coach should address both the spiritual and marital dimensions concurrently. Guilt and shame can be paralyzing, hindering both personal and relational repair. Supporting the offending spouse through repentance, understanding grace, and engaging in spiritual restoration is crucial for their personal healing, which in turn supports their capacity for marital repair (L2: Navigating the Aftermath of Infidelity and Betrayal, L7: Navigating Faith Disparity and Spiritual Crises in Marriage)."
