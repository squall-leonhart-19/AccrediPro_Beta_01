            "explanation": "Faith-based marriage treatment planning is fundamentally characterized by the integration of spiritual principles, biblical wisdom, and the couple's faith journey into every aspect of the assessment, goal setting, and intervention process.

            "options": [
                "Instruct the couple to choose one partner's purpose to prioritize for the marriage.",
                "Facilitate a deep exploration of their individual spiritual gifts and callings to identify areas of synergistic overlap.",
                "Advise them to set aside individual purposes and create an entirely new, unrelated marital purpose.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Module 21, L5 highlights that aligning individual purposes into a shared marital purpose often involves identifying synergistic overlaps.

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A couple reports a lack of connection beyond their shared religious practices, indicating a superficial bond. Which area of intimacy, often overlooked but crucial for a holistic faith-based marriage, should the coach focus on developing to deepen their bond, based on Module 21, L6?",
            "options": [
                "Intellectual intimacy, through shared learning and discussions.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While spiritual intimacy is foundational, Module 21, L6 emphasizes that a holistic faith-based marriage requires nurturing various forms of intimacy. If connection is superficial despite shared religious practices, developing emotional intimacy—fostering vulnerability, empathy, and the sharing of feelings—is often the critical missing piece to deepen their bond beyond surface-level interactions."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In Module 21, L7, the importance of robust accountability for action steps is highlighted. Which statement best describes an effective faith-based accountability mechanism for a couple's treatment plan?",

                "Each partner is accountable only to themselves, relying on personal discipline.",
                "Accountability is primarily achieved through weekly written reports submitted to the coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Module 21, L7 stresses that effective accountability in a faith-based context is often mutual.

The coach facilitates this, but the primary accountability lies within the marital dyad."

            "question": "A couple has made significant progress, but the coach identifies potential triggers for old conflict patterns. According to Module 21, L8, what is a critical component of a comprehensive relapse prevention plan for this couple?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the couple to avoid all situations that previously led to conflict.",
                "Developing a 'trigger identification and response' plan, including faith-based coping strategies and spiritual disciplines.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Module 21, L8 emphasizes that relapse prevention involves proactive strategies. A critical component is developing a 'trigger identification and response' plan. This includes recognizing specific triggers, developing faith-based coping strategies (e.g., prayer, scriptural meditation, seeking counsel), and practicing spiritual disciplines to respond constructively rather than reverting to old patterns."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "During the initial assessment, a coach uses a standardized marital satisfaction inventory and a spiritual assessment tool. How should these tools primarily be utilized throughout the treatment planning process, beyond initial data collection, according to Module 21, L2 and L7?",
            "options": [
                "They should only be used once at the beginning to establish baseline data.",
                "They should be re-administered periodically to monitor progress, adjust goals, and celebrate milestones.",
                "They are primarily for the coach's internal documentation and not shared with the couple.",
                "They serve as a final evaluation only upon termination of coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Module 21, L2 and L7 highlight that assessment tools are not just for initial data collection. They are vital for ongoing progress monitoring. Re-administering them periodically allows the coach and couple to objectively assess changes, confirm the effectiveness of interventions, adjust goals as needed, and recognize progress, which is crucial for motivation."

            "question": "A coach is developing a COVENANT-Aligned plan for a couple struggling with financial stewardship. Which approach best integrates scripture and the COVENANT framework to address this specific challenge holistically, based on Module 21, L3 and L6?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend a secular budget plan and suggest they pray about it independently.",
                "Integrate biblical principles of stewardship (e.g., tithing, debt management) into their 'Vision' and 'Accountability' components, supported by relevant scripture for 'Empowerment'.",
                "Focus solely on identifying individual spending habits and assign each partner a separate financial goal.",
                "Advise them to seek financial counseling from their church, without integrating it into the marriage coaching plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A holistic, faith-based approach integrates spiritual principles directly into the treatment plan. For financial stewardship, this means incorporating biblical principles (Module 21, L6) into the COVENANT framework. For example, their 'Vision' (V) could include shared financial goals rooted in stewardship, 'Accountability' (A) for budgeting, and 'Empowerment' (E) through scripture related to provision and generosity. This ensures the intervention is faith-aligned and comprehensive."
