            "question": "What is a primary distinction between Faith-Based Marriage Coaching and traditional marriage counseling?",
            "options": [
                "Coaching focuses on diagnosing past trauma.",
                "Coaching primarily addresses mental health disorders.",
                "Coaching is future-oriented, focusing on growth and goal attainment within a faith context.",
                "Coaching is exclusively for couples experiencing severe conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Faith-Based Marriage Coaching emphasizes leveraging strengths and faith principles to achieve future relationship goals, rather than diagnosing past issues or treating mental health disorders, which are typically within the scope of counseling or therapy. This aligns with the forward-looking nature discussed in L1."

            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'V' in the C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. Framework™ stands for Vision Casting, where couples are guided to articulate and align on their shared aspirations, purpose, and future direction for their marriage, as introduced in L2."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A coach aims to establish a 'sacred space' for a couple. Which action is most crucial for achieving this, according to AccrediPro standards presented in L3?",
            "options": [
                "Decorating the coaching room with religious symbols.",
                "Ensuring absolute confidentiality and a non-judgmental environment.",
                "Immediately offering specific biblical advice for their problems.",
                "Sharing personal marital experiences to build relatability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing a sacred space (the 'C' in C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T.) prioritizes creating a secure, confidential, and non-judgmental environment where couples feel safe to be vulnerable and explore their challenges without fear of exposure or condemnation. This was a core tenet of L3."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "A coaching client, Sarah, reveals during a session that her husband, Mark, has a serious gambling addiction, a detail he explicitly asked her not to share. According to ethical guidelines for FBM coaches (L4), what is the most appropriate action?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately inform Mark that Sarah disclosed his addiction.",
                "Encourage Sarah to confront Mark about her disclosure.",
                "Maintain confidentiality regarding Sarah's disclosure, but guide the couple towards discussing sensitive topics together and consider the limits of coaching for addiction.",
                "Refer Sarah to an addiction specialist without Mark's knowledge."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical guidelines (L4) emphasize confidentiality. While the coach cannot betray Sarah's trust, they must also ensure the coaching remains effective and within scope. Guiding the couple to open communication and recognizing when a referral to a specialist (e.g., for addiction) is needed, while maintaining client confidentiality, is the most ethical path. Unilateral referral of Sarah or breaking confidentiality are inappropriate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The concept of covenant is central to the biblical understanding of marriage, signifying a sacred, binding agreement before God that emphasizes permanence, faithfulness, and unwavering commitment, even through challenges, as highlighted in L5."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "During a session, a client states, 'I just feel so unheard. It's like my words disappear into thin air.' Which response demonstrates strong empathetic communication and active listening (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "\"Have you tried speaking louder?\"",
                "\"So, if I understand correctly, you're feeling a deep sense of frustration and invalidation when you try to express yourself?\"",
                "\"I understand. My spouse does that to me sometimes too.\"",
                "\"What do you think your spouse should do differently?\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This response uses paraphrasing and reflection of feeling, which are key components of active listening and empathetic communication taught in L6. It seeks to confirm understanding and validates the client's emotional experience without interjecting personal opinions or advice."

            "options": [
                "Immediately challenging their negative assumptions about coaching.",
                "Sharing detailed success stories from other couples.",
                "Demonstrating genuine interest, active listening, and consistently maintaining a non-judgmental stance.",
                "Recommending a specific spiritual discipline as a quick fix."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Building rapport and trust, especially with skeptical clients, hinges on the coach's genuine presence, consistent active listening, and maintaining a non-judgmental, safe environment. This allows the couple to feel heard and respected, gradually opening up to the coaching process, as emphasized in L7."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Coach Ben is conducting an initial assessment with a couple struggling with financial disagreements. Beyond their immediate concerns, what broader area, crucial for a holistic understanding of their marital health (L8), should Ben also assess?",
            "options": [
                "Their individual career aspirations.",
                "Their extended family's financial history.",

                "The specific details of their monthly budget."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While financial details are important, a holistic initial assessment goes beyond the presenting problem. Evaluating shared values, spiritual practices, and underlying conflict resolution patterns provides crucial context and insight into the couple's overall marital health, which often underpins specific issues, as discussed in L8."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A couple approaches a faith-based marriage coach, explaining that one partner has recently been diagnosed with severe depression and is considering separation. What is the coach's ethical responsibility in this scenario, according to L4?",
            "options": [
                "Provide immediate faith-based counseling to help them cope with the depression and avoid separation.",
                "Focus exclusively on communication skills, as depression is a medical issue outside the coaching scope.",
                "Acknowledge the severity of the situation, maintain support, and strongly recommend concurrent professional mental health intervention (e.g., therapy, medical evaluation).",
                "Tell the couple that their faith should be strong enough to overcome depression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Faith-based coaches operate within a specific scope of practice (L4). While providing support, severe depression is a mental health condition requiring professional medical and therapeutic intervention. The ethical coach will recognize these limits, maintain a supportive role for the marriage, but prioritize the individual's health by recommending appropriate referrals."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A couple states their goal is 'to be happier.' How should a faith-based marriage coach guide them to refine this goal using collaborative goal-setting principles (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "Accept 'to be happier' as a valid goal and proceed.",
                "Rephrase it for them as 'to communicate more effectively.'",
                "Help them break down 'happier' into measurable, actionable, and specific components, aligned with their faith values (e.g., 'We will have a weekly date night to reconnect and pray together').",
                "Explain that happiness is subjective and cannot be a coaching goal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collaborative goal setting (L8) emphasizes creating SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals. 'To be happier' is vague. The coach's role is to help the couple define what 'happier' looks like in concrete, actionable terms that reflect their values and can be tracked."
