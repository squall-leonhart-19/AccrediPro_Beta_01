            "explanation": "In the C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. Framework™, 'V' stands for Values & Vision Alignment, emphasizing the importance of discovering and aligning a couple's shared purpose and core beliefs for a thriving marriage."

            "question": "During the 'Connect & Clarify' phase (L2), a coach observes a couple frequently interrupting each other and avoiding eye contact. Which initial assessment strategy would be most effective for understanding the underlying dynamics?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately assigning communication exercises to practice active listening.",
                "Scheduling individual intake sessions to gather personal perspectives and history.",
                "Providing a list of biblical verses on respectful communication.",
                "Asking them to debate a controversial topic to observe conflict styles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L2, individual intake sessions allow the coach to establish rapport, understand each partner's perspective, identify potential attachment styles or past traumas, and clarify their personal goals without the immediate pressure of the partner's presence, which is crucial when initial joint communication is strained. This aligns with a comprehensive initial assessment approach."

            "question": "A wife tells her husband, 'You never listen to me, and you always dismiss my feelings.' Which of the following 'I' statements, as taught in L3, would be a more constructive way for her to express her need?",
            "options": [
                "'I feel unheard when I try to share my concerns, and I need you to acknowledge my feelings.'",
                "'I wish you would just pay attention for once when I'm talking.'",
                "'It's frustrating when you act like my feelings don't matter to you.'",
                "'You make me feel like I'm not important when you don't listen.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L3 emphasizes that effective 'I' statements focus on the speaker's feelings and needs without blaming or accusing the partner. Option A clearly articulates her feeling ('I feel unheard'), specifies the situation ('when I try to share my concerns'), and states her need ('I need you to acknowledge my feelings'), making it empathetic and honest."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In L4's discussion on navigating conflict, what is a key principle for successful conflict resolution, particularly when emotions are escalating?",
            "options": [
                "Insisting on resolving the conflict immediately, even if it means raising voices.",
                "Agreeing to disagree and avoiding the topic in the future.",
                "Utilizing a 'time-out' strategy to de-escalate and return to the discussion later.",
                "Bringing up past grievances to provide context for the current argument."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L4 highlights the 'time-out' strategy as crucial for de-escalating conflict. When emotions run high, effective communication is nearly impossible. Taking a mutually agreed-upon break allows both partners to calm down, reflect, and approach the discussion more constructively, often leading to better outcomes, as evidenced in studies showing improved marital satisfaction in couples who master de-escalation techniques."

            "question": "A couple struggles with differing opinions on how to raise their children spiritually, leading to frequent arguments. According to L5, what foundational element should the coach help them explore to bridge this gap?",
            "options": [
                "Developing a detailed daily spiritual routine for the children.",
                "Identifying their individual core values and working towards a shared vision for their family's spiritual legacy.",

                "Encouraging each parent to take turns leading spiritual instruction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L5 stresses that marital harmony is deeply rooted in aligned values and a shared vision. When conflict arises from differing approaches, exploring the underlying individual values (e.g., discipline, grace, tradition) and collaboratively constructing a shared vision for their family's spiritual formation can provide a unifying framework, rather than focusing solely on tactical solutions."

            "question": "When 'Empowering Through Scripture' (L6), a faith-based marriage coach should prioritize which of the following approaches?",
            "options": [
                "Using scripture primarily to prove one partner's point over the other's.",
                "Selecting isolated verses to offer quick fixes to complex marital issues.",
                "Guiding couples to prayerfully engage with relevant biblical principles and narratives to inform their understanding and actions.",
                "Insisting on a specific denominational interpretation of biblical texts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L6 emphasizes that effective scriptural integration involves guiding couples to prayerfully and thoughtfully engage with the broader context of biblical principles and narratives. This fosters deeper understanding, personal conviction, and application, rather than using scripture as a weapon or a simplistic solution, which can be detrimental to the coaching process."

            "question": "Sarah expresses to her coach that she feels disconnected from her husband, Mark, despite them living in the same house. She says they rarely talk about their day or their feelings. Based on L7, what area of intimacy is most likely lacking for Sarah?",
            "options": [
                "Recreational intimacy",
                "Spiritual intimacy",
                "Physical intimacy",
                "Emotional intimacy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "L7 defines emotional intimacy as the ability to share feelings, vulnerabilities, and thoughts with a partner and feel understood and validated. Sarah's description of rarely talking about their day or feelings directly points to a lack in emotional intimacy, which is crucial for overall connection."

            "options": [
                "Decide to 'try harder' to find time for each other next week.",
                "Commit to a weekly 'date night' every Friday from 7-9 PM, alternating planning responsibilities, and setting a reminder.",
                "Agree that if one person feels neglected, they should bring it up.",
                "Wait until their schedules naturally align to spend time together."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L8 emphasizes creating SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals and action plans. Option B is specific (weekly date night), measurable (every Friday 7-9 PM), achievable (alternating planning), relevant (quality time), and time-bound (specific time). It also includes accountability with reminders and shared responsibility."

            "question": "What is a core distinction between the role of a faith-based marriage coach and a marriage counselor, as highlighted in L1?",
            "options": [
                "A coach primarily focuses on past trauma and mental health diagnoses, while a counselor focuses on future-oriented goals.",
                "A coach provides expert advice and tells couples what to do, while a counselor guides them to their own solutions.",
                "A coach partners with clients to identify goals and implement action steps for growth, whereas a counselor typically addresses deeper psychological issues and past wounds.",
                "A coach strictly avoids spiritual integration, while a counselor always incorporates it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L1 clarifies that a faith-based marriage coach focuses on empowering couples to identify goals, develop strategies, and take action for future growth and positive change, often integrating spiritual principles. A marriage counselor, conversely, typically delves into deeper psychological issues, past traumas, and mental health diagnoses, operating within a different scope of practice and licensure."

            "question": "During a coaching session, a couple is arguing about household chores, specifically who does the dishes. The coach suspects this surface-level conflict points to a deeper issue. Based on insights from L4 and L7, what might be the underlying unmet need being expressed?",
            "options": [
                "A need for a more efficient dishwashing machine.",
                "A desire for better time management skills.",
                "Unmet needs for appreciation, fairness, or feeling valued and seen in the relationship.",
                "A preference for a different brand of dish soap."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Both L4 and L7 highlight that surface-level conflicts often mask deeper, unmet needs related to emotional connection and intimacy. Arguments over chores frequently stem from feelings of being unappreciated, an imbalance of effort, or a lack of feeling valued and seen by one's partner. The coach's role is to help the couple uncover these underlying needs to address the root cause, rather than just the symptom."
