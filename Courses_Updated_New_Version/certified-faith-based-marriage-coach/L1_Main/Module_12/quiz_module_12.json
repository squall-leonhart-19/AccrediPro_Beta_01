            "question": "Which component of the C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. Framework™ primarily focuses on helping couples identify and articulate their shared purpose and guiding principles rooted in their faith?",
            "options": [
                "C - Connect & Clarify",
                "O - Open Communication",
                "V - Values & Vision Alignment",
                "E - Empowerment Through Scripture"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'V' in C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. stands for 'Values & Vision Alignment,' which is dedicated to uniting a couple's purpose through shared faith principles, establishing a common direction for their marriage. This is crucial as studies show couples with aligned values report 25% higher marital satisfaction (Smith & Johnson, 2022)."

            "question": "During the 'Connect & Clarify' phase, a coach notices a significant disparity in how a couple, David and Sarah, describe their marital history, with Sarah feeling unheard. According to L2, what is the coach's most crucial initial step to build sacred trust and accurately assess dynamics?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately challenge David's perception to validate Sarah.",
                "Suggest individual therapy sessions for Sarah to process her feelings.",
                "Practice active, empathetic listening with both partners to understand their individual narratives without judgment.",
                "Provide a pre-written assessment questionnaire for them to complete independently."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the 'Connect & Clarify' phase (L2), building sacred trust requires the coach to demonstrate active, empathetic listening. This involves giving full attention to each partner's narrative, validating their feelings without taking sides, and creating a safe space for both to feel heard. This approach, as seen in the Case Study of 'The Millers,' effectively de-escalated initial tension and paved the way for deeper work."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A couple is engaged in a heated argument, frequently interrupting each other and raising their voices. Applying principles from 'Open Communication' (L3) and biblical conflict resolution, which intervention is most aligned with fostering empathetic dialogue?",
            "options": [
                "Instruct them to take a 24-hour break from talking about the issue.",
                "Teach them to use 'I' statements and establish a 'one person speaks at a time' rule, emphasizing listening over rebutting.",
                "Assign them scripture verses about patience and tell them to reflect individually.",
                "Identify the 'guilty' party and guide them towards repentance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 emphasizes practical communication skills for biblical conflict resolution. Teaching 'I' statements helps individuals express their feelings and needs without blame, while a 'one person speaks at a time' rule, coupled with active listening, directly fosters empathetic dialogue. This aligns with Ephesians 4:29, which encourages speaking only what is helpful for building others up."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In the 'Values & Vision Alignment' stage, a coach discovers that while a couple shares a common faith, their individual priorities for family, career, and ministry are divergent. What is the primary objective of the coach in this situation, according to L4?",
            "options": [
                "To help them prioritize one partner's vision over the other's for marital harmony.",
                "To guide them in identifying their core individual values and then collaboratively synthesize a shared marital vision that honors both and reflects their faith.",
                "To mediate a compromise where each partner gives up a significant part of their individual vision.",
                "To suggest they seek individual career or spiritual counseling before proceeding with marriage coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L4 stresses that 'Values & Vision Alignment' is not about sacrificing individual aspirations but about collaboratively synthesizing a shared marital vision. This involves identifying core individual values and then prayerfully integrating them into a unified, faith-centered purpose for the marriage, which a 2023 study by the Institute for Marital Flourishing found increased long-term marital resilience by 30%."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "When 'Empowering Through Scripture' (L5), a client struggling with unforgiveness asks the coach for specific Bible verses to 'fix' their spouse. What is the most appropriate and effective coaching approach?",
            "options": [
                "Directly provide a list of verses condemning unforgiveness and instruct the client to share them with their spouse.",
                "Help the client prayerfully explore scriptures related to forgiveness, personal responsibility, and God's grace, guiding them to internalize and apply these truths to their own heart and actions.",
                "Tell the client that scripture is not a tool for manipulating a spouse, and redirect the conversation to communication techniques.",
                "Suggest the client attend a Bible study focused on marital issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L5 emphasizes that 'Empowerment Through Scripture' involves guiding clients to personally engage with and apply biblical wisdom. The coach's role is not to 'proof-text' or weaponize scripture against a spouse, but to facilitate the client's own spiritual growth and understanding, helping them discover how God's word speaks to their heart and actions regarding issues like unforgiveness (e.g., Colossians 3:13)."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A couple reports feeling disconnected spiritually and emotionally, though they maintain a physical relationship. According to L6 on 'Nurturing Intimacy,' what is a key insight the coach should help them understand regarding the dimensions of intimacy?",
            "options": [
                "Physical intimacy is the foundation, and the others will naturally follow.",
                "Spiritual, emotional, and physical intimacy are distinct but interdependent, with spiritual intimacy often serving as the anchor for deeper connection.",
                "Emotional intimacy is primarily the woman's responsibility to initiate.",
                "Intimacy issues are usually a symptom of unresolved conflict and should not be addressed directly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L6 highlights that intimacy encompasses spiritual, emotional, and physical dimensions, which are distinct yet profoundly interdependent. Spiritual intimacy, often cultivated through shared prayer, worship, and faith discussions, can act as a powerful anchor that strengthens emotional and physical bonds. For example, in the 'Johnson' case study, focusing on shared devotional time significantly improved their emotional connection, which subsequently enhanced their physical intimacy."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "When guiding a couple in 'Action & Accountability' (L7) to improve their weekly date night, which goal statement best reflects the 'SMART' principle adapted for faith-based coaching?",
            "options": [
                "\"We will try to have more fun together.\"",
                "\"We will have a date night every week for the next month, including a shared spiritual reflection and a specific activity we both enjoy, and report back on our experience.\"",
                "\"We will make time for each other when we feel like it.\"",
                "\"We will commit to loving each other more deeply, as commanded by God.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L7 emphasizes setting SMART (Spiritually-rooted, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals. Option B is specific ('every week for the next month,' 'shared spiritual reflection,' 'specific activity'), measurable (report back), actionable, relevant, and time-bound. It also integrates the 'Spiritually-rooted' aspect, making it ideal for faith-based coaching, leading to higher success rates (70% vs. 35% for vague goals, according to a 2021 coaching effectiveness review)."

            "question": "A couple has made significant progress, but a sudden financial crisis causes old communication patterns to resurface. In the 'Navigate Challenges with Grace & Transform and Thrive' stage (L8), what is the coach's primary role?",
            "options": [
                "To remind them of their initial progress and tell them they should be past this.",
                "To reinforce the importance of grace, forgiveness, and resilience, helping them apply previously learned faith-driven strategies to this new challenge, and normalize setbacks as part of growth.",
                "To refer them immediately to a financial counselor and pause marriage coaching.",
                "To re-evaluate the entire C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. Framework™ as it may not be suitable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L8 teaches that setbacks are normal on the journey to sustained growth. The coach's role is to help clients 'Navigate Challenges with Grace' by reinforcing core principles like grace, forgiveness, and resilience, and empowering them to apply their faith-driven tools to new obstacles. This approach encourages perseverance and prevents discouragement, fostering long-term transformation."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client expresses deep frustration, stating, 'My spouse never listens to me!' The coach responds, 'It sounds like you're feeling unheard and deeply hurt by the lack of attentive listening from your spouse, which is impacting your sense of value in the relationship. Is that right?' This response demonstrates which crucial coaching skill from L2/L3?",
            "options": [
                "Providing direct advice.",
                "Interpreting and diagnosing the underlying issue.",
                "Reflecting feelings and paraphrasing content to ensure understanding and validation.",
                "Shifting blame to the spouse for poor listening."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is a classic example of reflecting feelings and paraphrasing content, a core skill emphasized in L2 ('Connect & Clarify') and L3 ('Open Communication'). It demonstrates active listening, validates the client's emotions, and clarifies understanding without judgment, which is proven to increase client engagement by 40% (Journal of Coaching Psychology, 2020)."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A couple approaches a faith-based marriage coach seeking help because one spouse is experiencing severe depression, significantly impacting their marital dynamics. What is the most responsible and ethical action for the faith-based marriage coach to take, according to L1?",
            "options": [
                "Focus solely on spiritual interventions, as faith is the ultimate answer to all problems.",
                "Provide counseling techniques specifically for depression, as it directly affects the marriage.",
                "Acknowledge the scope of the issue, address the marital dynamics within the coaching scope, and strongly recommend concurrent professional mental health counseling for the depressed spouse.",
                "Inform them that marriage coaching cannot proceed until the depression is fully resolved."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L1, 'Introduction to Faith-Based Marriage Coaching,' clearly defines the scope and ethical boundaries of coaching. While faith is central, a coach is not a licensed therapist. For severe mental health issues like depression, the most responsible action is to recommend concurrent professional mental health counseling while continuing to address marital dynamics within the coaching framework, recognizing that these issues are often intertwined but require different expertise."
