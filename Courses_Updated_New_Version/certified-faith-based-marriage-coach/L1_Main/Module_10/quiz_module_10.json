            "question": "What is a primary distinction between faith-based marriage coaching and traditional marriage counseling, as outlined in the 'Foundations of Faith-Based Marriage Coaching' lesson?",
            "options": [
                "Coaching focuses on past traumas, while counseling primarily addresses future goals and aspirations.",
                "Coaching emphasizes skill development, goal setting, and forward movement, while counseling often addresses deeper psychological issues, past patterns, and mental health diagnoses.",
                "Counseling always integrates spiritual principles, while faith-based coaching strictly avoids them to maintain neutrality.",
                "Coaching is entirely unregulated, whereas counseling requires extensive state-level licensing for all practitioners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Faith-based marriage coaching is distinct from counseling in its focus on empowering couples to develop skills, set goals, and move forward, rather than diagnosing and treating mental health conditions or extensively exploring past psychological issues, which are typical of traditional counseling. Both are professional fields, but with different scopes and approaches."

            "question": "According to the biblical framework discussed in 'The Covenant of Marriage,' what concept primarily defines the permanence, sacredness, and unbreakable nature of the marital bond?",
            "options": [
                "A social contract between two individuals that can be dissolved by mutual consent.",
                "A legal agreement recognized by the state, providing rights and responsibilities to both parties.",
                "A divinely instituted covenant between a man, a woman, and God, intended for lifelong fidelity and spiritual unity.",
                "A partnership based primarily on mutual affection, shared interests, and personal happiness, which can evolve over time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Covenant of Marriage' lesson emphasizes that marriage, from a biblical perspective, is a sacred covenant. This implies a lifelong, exclusive, and unbreakable bond established by God, not merely a human agreement or contract."

            "question": "During the 'Connect & Clarify' phase, a coach observes one spouse, Sarah, repeatedly sighing and crossing her arms when her husband, David, speaks. As the coach, what is the most appropriate initial response to build rapport and clarify the dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "\"Sarah, please uncross your arms; your body language appears defensive and is hindering communication.\"",
                "\"David, it seems Sarah is visibly upset by what you're saying; perhaps you should rephrase.\"",
                "\"Sarah, I've noticed some non-verbal cues – a sigh and crossed arms. Would you be willing to share what's coming up for you right now as David speaks?\"",
                "\"Let's take a break; the tension in the room is too high for productive discussion.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This response is empathetic, non-judgmental, and invites Sarah to self-reflect and communicate her internal experience. It directly addresses the observable behavior without assigning blame, aligning with the goals of building rapport and clarifying issues in a safe space."

            "options": [
                "The blame-shifting technique, where each spouse identifies the other's faults clearly.",
                "The 'I' statement technique, focusing on expressing personal feelings, needs, and observations without assigning blame to the partner.",
                "The 'you always/you never' accusation, which highlights patterns of behavior for immediate change.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'I' statement technique is a cornerstone of empathetic communication. It helps individuals take ownership of their feelings and express them constructively, reducing defensiveness and fostering understanding, as opposed to accusatory language."

            "question": "A couple, Mark and Lisa, frequently argue over how to spend their leisure time, revealing differing priorities. In the 'Values & Vision Alignment' phase, the coach would guide them to primarily focus on which of the following?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Values & Vision Alignment' lesson emphasizes that underlying conflicts often stem from misaligned values.

            "options": [
                "Provide them with a specific Bible verse and tell them exactly how to solve their financial problem, acting as an authoritative interpreter.",
                "Encourage them to individually read the Bible until they find an answer that resonates with each of them, without further discussion.",
                "Facilitate their joint exploration of relevant biblical principles (e.g., stewardship, trust in God, generosity, wisdom in planning) and help them discern how these principles apply to their unique financial situation and decision-making.",
                "Advise them that financial issues are purely secular and outside the direct scope of scriptural guidance for marriage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lesson on 'Empowerment Through Scripture' emphasizes facilitating discernment and application. A coach's role is not to dictate answers but to guide couples in understanding and applying God's principles to their specific challenges, fostering spiritual growth and shared decision-making."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spiritual intimacy goes beyond mere religious observance.

            "question": "After working through communication barriers, a couple develops an action plan to implement weekly 'check-in' conversations.

            "options": [
                "They must be complex and highly challenging to demonstrate the couple's commitment and perseverance.",
                "They should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART goals).",
                "They must be solely decided by the coach to ensure expert guidance and prevent client error.",
                "They should be vague enough to allow for maximum flexibility and avoid feelings of failure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Laying the Groundwork for Action & Resilience' lesson emphasizes the importance of SMART goals. Action steps that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound are far more likely to be implemented consistently, leading to sustained change and enhanced resilience in the marriage."

            "question": "During a coaching session, one spouse, Alex, consistently interrupts his partner, Ben, preventing Ben from fully expressing his thoughts. This behavior is impacting rapport and open communication. What is the most effective coaching intervention in this scenario, drawing from lessons on connection and communication?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the interruptions, hoping they will self-correct as the session progresses.",
                "Directly tell Alex he is being rude and needs to stop interrupting immediately.",
                "Gently interrupt Alex, acknowledge his eagerness, then invite Ben to complete his thought, perhaps introducing a 'speaker-listener' rule for structured dialogue.",
                "Ask Ben to speak louder and more assertively so Alex can hear him better and is less likely to interrupt."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This intervention is constructive and respectful. It addresses the behavior without shaming Alex, validates Ben's need to speak, and introduces a practical communication tool (like the speaker-listener rule) to facilitate more equitable and empathetic dialogue, aligning with both 'Connect & Clarify' and 'Open Communication' principles."

                "Determining which spouse is primarily at fault for the marital difficulties.",
                "Strengthening individual resolve to potentially leave the marriage if issues remain unresolved.",

                "Minimizing expectations within the marriage to avoid future disappointment and conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Faith-based marriage coaching, rooted in a covenantal understanding, views challenges not as failures but as catalysts for growth. Difficulties can lead to a deeper spiritual walk, increased reliance on God, and a more resilient, refined marital relationship, fulfilling the divine purpose of marriage."
