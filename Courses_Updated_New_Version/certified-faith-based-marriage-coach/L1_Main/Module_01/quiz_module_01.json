            "question": "In the AccrediPro C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. Framework™, the 'Connect & Clarify' module (Module 1) is primarily designed to achieve which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Establish a deep understanding of the couple's current relational dynamics and core challenges.",
                "Develop actionable strategies for conflict resolution and communication improvement.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Connect & Clarify' phase is foundational, focusing on gathering comprehensive data, understanding presenting problems and core challenges, and establishing the initial relational landscape before moving to intervention strategies."

            "question": "During a coaching session, a client discloses a past infidelity that occurred five years ago, expressing deep remorse and indicating the spouse is unaware. There is no immediate threat of harm to self or others. What is the faith-based marriage coach's primary ethical obligation regarding this information?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately encourage the client to confess to their spouse for transparency.",
                "Maintain strict confidentiality unless disclosure is legally mandated or imminent harm exists.",
                "Inform the spouse privately to ensure full disclosure within the marriage.",
                "Document the infidelity and advise the client to seek legal counsel."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A core principle of establishing a sacred space is confidentiality. Unless there is a legal mandate or imminent threat of harm, the coach's primary ethical duty is to maintain the client's privacy. The coach would, however, guide the client in processing this information and its implications within the context of their faith and marital health."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For faith-based marriage coaching, understanding a couple's spiritual background, practices, and beliefs is paramount. This data informs how faith can be integrated into their growth journey and helps the coach tailor interventions that resonate with their spiritual values."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A couple reports their 'presenting problem' as 'we fight constantly about money.' Through empathetic inquiry, the coach discovers underlying issues related to differing financial values, past family trauma around scarcity, and a lack of trust in each other's financial decisions. This illustrates the importance of differentiating:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This scenario perfectly illustrates the core concept of Module 1, Lesson 4: distinguishing the surface-level 'presenting problem' (fighting about money) from the deeper, often systemic 'core relational challenges' (values, trauma, trust) that truly drive the conflict."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "When a spouse states, 'I just feel so alone in this marriage, like my efforts don't matter,' which response best exemplifies empathetic inquiry combined with active listening?",

                "\"It sounds like you need to focus on self-care and building your individual support system.\"",
                "\"Let's brainstorm some ways your partner can make you feel more valued.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Option A demonstrates active listening by reflecting the spouse's feelings ('isolated and unappreciated') and uses empathetic inquiry ('Can you tell me more...') to invite deeper exploration of their experience, fostering connection and understanding."

            "question": "In assessing communication patterns, a coach observes that whenever one partner expresses a complaint, the other immediately launches into a counter-attack, blaming the first partner for the problem. According to John Gottman's research on marital distress, this pattern is most closely aligned with which of the 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'?",
            "options": [
                "Criticism",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Defensiveness, in Gottman's framework, involves self-protection in the face of perceived attack, often by making excuses, cross-complaining, or blaming the other partner. The description of launching into a counter-attack aligns directly with defensiveness."

            "question": "A couple consistently argues about their division of labor at home. Upon deeper inquiry, the coach discovers that one partner implicitly believes the other should anticipate their needs and volunteer for tasks, while the other believes tasks should be explicitly assigned. This discrepancy primarily highlights a challenge in:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core issue described is a misalignment between unstated or assumed expectations about roles and responsibilities. Lesson 7 specifically addresses the critical importance of uncovering these often implicit individual and shared expectations and assumptions to resolve marital friction."

                "Guide and facilitate the couple in collaboratively articulating their own shared, faith-centered marital future.",
                "Focus exclusively on resolving past grievances to clear the path for future growth.",
                "Provide individual spiritual direction to each spouse separately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vision casting in marriage coaching is a collaborative process. The coach's role is to guide and facilitate the couple in creating their own shared vision, ensuring it is aligned with their faith values, rather than imposing one upon them."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "During an initial intake, a coach observes that one partner consistently interrupts the other, dismisses their feelings with phrases like 'you're overreacting,' and frequently speaks for them, saying things like 'we both know...' This pattern should primarily alert the coach to potential issues related to:",

                "Financial mismanagement and budgeting conflicts.",
                "Imbalanced power dynamics and a lack of psychological safety.",

                "Poor time management skills and scheduling conflicts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These behaviors (interrupting, dismissing feelings, speaking for a partner) are strong indicators of imbalanced power dynamics within the relationship. They undermine a partner's autonomy and create an environment where one spouse may not feel safe or heard, which is critical for the 'Connect & Clarify' phase."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrating spiritual disciplines into a couple's vision is a hallmark of faith-based coaching. It reflects a commitment to fostering a holistic approach where spiritual well-being is intrinsically linked to and supports marital health and transformation, aligning with a Christ-centered or faith-centered perspective."
