            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Shared spiritual disciplines foster deeper intimacy, mutual understanding, and a stronger foundation, contributing significantly to marital satisfaction and resilience. While individual growth is part of it, the emphasis is on shared connection."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, Advanced Conflict Resolution, the concept of 'forgiveness' is distinguished from 'reconciliation.' Which statement accurately reflects this distinction?",
            "options": [
                "Forgiveness is primarily an emotional act, while reconciliation is a behavioral one.",
                "Forgiveness can occur unilaterally, but reconciliation requires mutual participation and trust-rebuilding.",
                "Reconciliation always precedes forgiveness in the healing process.",
                "Forgiveness implies forgetting the offense, whereas reconciliation means restoring the relationship to its pre-offense state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Forgiveness is an internal decision to release resentment and bitterness, which can be a unilateral act. Reconciliation, however, is a relational process that requires both parties' commitment to rebuild trust, address issues, and restore the relationship, and it does not necessarily mean forgetting the offense."
