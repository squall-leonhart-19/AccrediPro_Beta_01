                "To refine character, strengthen faith, and deepen reliance on God and each other.",

                "To serve as a direct punishment for past transgressions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "It primarily benefits the offending party by absolving them of all responsibility without requiring repentance.",
                "It primarily benefits the forgiver by releasing bitterness, fostering spiritual healing, and aligning with divine principles.",
                "It guarantees an immediate and complete restoration of trust and emotional intimacy.",
                "It requires forgetting the offense entirely to be effective and genuine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While forgiveness can impact the relationship, its primary transformative power lies in the internal healing and liberation it offers the forgiver, releasing them from the burden of resentment and bitterness.

                "Conflict resolution always involves a third-party mediator, while transformation is purely an internal process.",
                "Conflict transformation is only applicable to severe marital crises, unlike resolution which applies to minor disputes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conflict resolution often targets immediate solutions to specific issues.
