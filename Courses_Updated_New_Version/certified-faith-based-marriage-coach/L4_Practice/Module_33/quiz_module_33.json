            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach's primary role, as defined in L1, is to facilitate goal attainment and spiritual growth. Which client request would clearly fall outside a coach's scope of practice and necessitate a referral to a licensed mental health professional?",
            "options": [
                "Assistance in developing better communication strategies with their spouse.",
                "Guidance on integrating biblical principles into their marital conflict resolution.",
                "Diagnosis and treatment for a suspected clinical depression affecting their marriage.",
                "Support in identifying personal strengths to overcome marital stagnation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diagnosing and treating clinical conditions like depression is exclusively within the scope of licensed mental health professionals, not coaches. Coaches focus on present and future goal-setting, skill development, and spiritual guidance, as clearly delineated in L1: Differentiating Faith-Based Coaching from Therapy & Counseling."
        },

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "According to L4, 'Crafting Comprehensive Coaching Agreements & Informed Consent,' a well-structured coaching agreement is crucial for managing client expectations and mitigating risk. Which of the following components is MOST vital for clearly defining the boundaries and scope of the coaching relationship?",
            "options": [
                "A detailed invoice schedule for all sessions.",
                "A disclaimer explicitly stating coaching is not therapy or counseling.",
                "A list of recommended theological texts for marital enrichment.",
                "The coach's personal testimony of marital success."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A clear disclaimer differentiating coaching from therapy is paramount in the coaching agreement. This manages client expectations, prevents misunderstandings about the coach's role, and is a key risk mitigation strategy, as highlighted by numerous legal precedents in the coaching industry and discussed in L4."

        {
            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "In L3, 'Confidentiality, Privacy, and Data Protection,' it is emphasized that while client confidentiality is paramount, there are specific legal limits. If a client discloses during a session that their spouse is physically abusing their minor child, what is the faith-based marriage coach's immediate ethical and legal obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain strict confidentiality to protect the client's privacy.",
                "Advise the client to seek legal counsel for the abuse.",
                "Document the disclosure and continue the session, addressing the marital issue.",
                "Report the suspected child abuse to the appropriate child protective services, as mandated by law."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Mandated reporting laws supersede confidentiality agreements when there is a reasonable suspicion of child abuse, elder abuse, or danger to self or others. A faith-based coach, like many professionals, is legally obligated to report suspected child abuse to protect vulnerable individuals, as detailed in L8: Navigating Crisis, Mandated Reporting, and Legal Consultation. Failure to report can result in legal penalties."

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "L2, 'Establishing Professional Boundaries & Referral Protocols,' stresses the importance of a robust referral network. A client, 'Sarah,' expresses profound and persistent feelings of hopelessness, severe sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation during a coaching session. What is the most appropriate action for her faith-based marriage coach?",
            "options": [
                "Focus on spiritual encouragement and prayer to uplift Sarah's spirits.",
                "Suggest Sarah engage in more positive self-talk and mindfulness exercises.",
                "Immediately refer Sarah to a licensed mental health professional for crisis assessment and intervention.",
                "Continue coaching, but suggest she consider consulting her pastor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Expressions of suicidal ideation, combined with severe symptoms like hopelessness and sleep disturbance, indicate a mental health crisis. As discussed in L8, a coach's ethical and legal duty is to refer to appropriate licensed professionals for immediate assessment and intervention, as these issues fall outside the coaching scope and require specialized care."

            "id": "q33_5",
            "question": "According to L5, 'Professional Liability, Risk Mitigation, and Insurance,' securing professional liability insurance (Errors and Omissions or E&O) is a critical risk mitigation strategy for faith-based marriage coaches. What primary protection does E&O insurance offer?",
            "options": [
                "Covers property damage to the coach's office.",
                "Protects against claims of negligence, errors, or omissions in professional services.",
                "Reimburses clients for coaching fees if they are dissatisfied.",
                "Provides health insurance coverage for the coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional liability insurance, also known as Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance, specifically protects coaches against claims of professional negligence, errors, or omissions in the services they provide. This is crucial for managing the inherent risks associated with client interactions, with studies indicating E&O claims often arise from perceived unmet expectations or miscommunication, as discussed in L5."

            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "L6, 'Adhering to Ethical Codes & Faith-Based Ethical Frameworks,' emphasizes integrating faith principles with professional ethics. A coach is asked by a client, 'David,' to recommend a specific financial advisor who attends the coach's church. The coach knows the advisor personally and trusts them. What ethical principle should guide the coach's response?",
            "options": [
                "The principle of beneficence, recommending a trusted individual.",
                "The principle of non-maleficence, avoiding potential conflicts of interest.",
                "The principle of fidelity, maintaining loyalty to community members.",
                "The principle of autonomy, allowing the client to make their own choices after the recommendation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recommending a personal acquaintance can create a dual relationship or a perceived conflict of interest, potentially violating the principle of non-maleficence (doing no harm) by compromising objectivity or creating undue influence. It's best practice to avoid such specific endorsements and instead refer to a general category of professionals, allowing the client to choose, as discussed in L2 and L6."

            "id": "q33_7",
            "question": "In L7, 'Marketing, Disclosures, and Professional Representation,' ethical guidelines for marketing faith-based coaching services are outlined. Which marketing statement would be considered unethical and potentially misleading for a faith-based marriage coach?",
            "options": [
                "'Helping couples build stronger, God-honoring marriages through biblical principles and practical strategies.'",
                "'Certified Faith-Based Marriage Coach specializing in communication and intimacy.'",
                "'Guaranteed to fix your marriage in 3 sessions or your money back – proven therapeutic results!'",
                "'Providing confidential, supportive coaching for marital growth and spiritual alignment.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing prohibits making exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims, especially those implying therapeutic outcomes or guarantees, which are common pitfalls for coaches. The phrase 'Guaranteed to fix your marriage' and 'proven therapeutic results' are misleading, unethical, and blur the lines between coaching and therapy, violating principles discussed in L1 and L7."

            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach is working with 'Maria,' who confides that her spouse has been escalating verbal abuse and has threatened physical harm if she leaves. Maria expresses fear for her safety but is hesitant to involve authorities. Based on L8, 'Navigating Crisis, Mandated Reporting, and Legal Consultation,' what is the coach's primary responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage Maria to pray for her spouse's change of heart and stay in the marriage.",
                "Focus on Maria's role in de-escalating the conflict.",
                "Assess the immediate danger and assist Maria in developing a safety plan, potentially involving referrals to domestic violence resources and legal counsel.",
                "Advise Maria that marital issues are sacred and should be kept private within the family."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client expresses fear for their safety due to threats of physical harm, the coach's primary responsibility shifts to assessing immediate danger and supporting the client in creating a safety plan. This involves referrals to domestic violence resources, legal counsel, and potentially emergency services, as detailed in L8. This situation transcends typical coaching and requires immediate crisis intervention and adherence to legal and ethical duties to protect the client."

            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "Regarding data protection and client privacy, as covered in L3, 'Confidentiality, Privacy, and Data Protection,' which of the following is the most secure method for a faith-based marriage coach to store sensitive client notes and personal information electronically?",
            "options": [
                "On a personal laptop using standard password protection.",
                "In a cloud storage service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) without additional encryption.",
                "Using an encrypted, HIPAA-compliant client management system or secure cloud platform.",
                "On a flash drive kept in an unlocked desk drawer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Storing sensitive client data requires robust security measures. An encrypted, HIPAA-compliant (or equivalent data protection standard like GDPR, if applicable) client management system or secure cloud platform offers the highest level of protection against unauthorized access, data breaches, and aligns with best practices for data privacy, as emphasized in L3. A 2023 report indicated that cloud-based systems with robust encryption significantly reduce data breach risks compared to local storage."

            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "L2, 'Establishing Professional Boundaries & Referral Protocols,' underscores that clear boundaries are essential. A faith-based marriage coach receives an invitation to be a guest at a client's wedding, which will take place after the coaching engagement has concluded. What is the most ethically sound decision for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Attend the wedding to show support and celebrate the couple's success.",
                "Politely decline the invitation to maintain professional boundaries and avoid potential dual relationships.",
                "Accept the invitation but keep a professional distance during the event.",
                "Attend, but only if the client insists and offers to pay for the coach's travel."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Even after a coaching engagement concludes, maintaining clear professional boundaries is crucial to prevent dual relationships and uphold the integrity of the coaching profession. While well-intentioned, attending a client's wedding can blur professional lines and complicate future interactions or perceptions. Declining politely is the most ethically sound approach to preserve the professional nature of the relationship, as discussed in L2."
