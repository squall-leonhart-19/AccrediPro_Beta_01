            "question": "What is the primary advantage of forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) for a solo faith-based marriage coaching practice compared to operating as a sole proprietorship?",
            "options": [
                "It simplifies the annual tax filing process significantly.",
                "It provides personal liability protection, separating the coach's personal assets from business debts and legal claims.",
                "It eliminates the need for any form of business insurance.",
                "It has the lowest startup costs among all business structures."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Forming an LLC is primarily advantageous for the personal liability protection it offers. It legally separates the business's liabilities from the owner's personal assets, which is crucial for safeguarding personal wealth against potential business-related legal issues or debts. While tax filing can be simpler than a corporation, the main benefit is liability protection."

            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach is setting up their client management system. Which feature is MOST critical for maintaining compliance with privacy standards, especially when handling sensitive client data, in an online coaching environment?",
            "options": [
                "Integrated email marketing capabilities for newsletters.",
                "HIPAA-compliant data storage and secure, encrypted communication channels.",
                "Automated appointment reminders via standard SMS messages.",
                "Customizable invoice templates with branding options."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For any coaching practice handling sensitive client information, particularly in healthcare-related fields or those dealing with personal issues, HIPAA (or equivalent data protection regulations like GDPR) compliance is paramount. This requires secure, encrypted data storage and communication channels to protect client confidentiality and privacy, mitigating legal risks and building client trust."

            "question": "When developing a sustainable pricing model, a coach determines their <span class=\"stat-highlight\">target annual income of $90,000</span> and estimates <span class=\"stat-highlight\">annual operating expenses of $25,000</span>. If they plan to work with <span class=\"stat-highlight\">50 clients per year</span> on average, how should they strategically approach setting their per-client fee to ensure profitability and cover costs?",
            "options": [
                "Focus solely on competitor pricing to avoid being too expensive or too cheap.",
                "Divide only the target annual income ($90,000) by the number of clients (50) to get the minimum fee.",
                "Calculate the total required revenue ($90,000 + $25,000 = $115,000), then divide by client capacity (50), and consider adding a buffer for unforeseen costs and value-based pricing.",
                "Offer a flexible sliding scale to all clients regardless of their financial situation to ensure accessibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable pricing requires covering both desired income and all operating expenses. The total revenue needed is $115,000. Dividing this by 50 clients gives a base of $2,300 per client. Adding a buffer and considering value-based pricing ensures profitability and accounts for fluctuations, rather than just covering the bare minimum or solely reacting to competitor pricing."

            "question": "A new faith-based marriage coach is struggling to attract clients despite having strong credentials. They describe their services as 'general marriage coaching for anyone.' According to best practices in defining a niche, what is the most likely reason for their struggle?",
            "options": [
                "Their services are too broad and undifferentiated, making it difficult to target specific marketing efforts and resonate deeply with a particular client group's unique needs.",
                "They are likely charging too much for their coaching services compared to their experience level.",
                "They have not invested enough in paid social media advertising campaigns.",
                "Their brand logo and website design are probably not appealing enough to potential clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A broad, undifferentiated service offering makes it challenging to stand out in a competitive market. Defining a specific niche (e.g., pre-marital counseling for young Christian couples, blended family support) allows a coach to tailor their messaging, specialize their expertise, and attract clients who specifically seek that unique focus, leading to more effective marketing and client acquisition."

            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach receives an inquiry from a prospective client, Sarah, who mentions she is the sister of an existing client, Mark. Mark has not given permission to disclose his coaching relationship. What is the most ethical course of action for the coach, adhering to principles of confidentiality and professional boundaries?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with coaching Sarah, but strictly avoid any discussion about Mark or his coaching.",
                "Inform Mark that his sister Sarah has inquired about coaching services.",
                "Decline to coach Sarah due to the potential for a conflict of interest and the risk of breaching Mark's confidentiality, and provide Sarah with referrals to other qualified coaches.",
                "Ask Sarah to keep her relationship with Mark a secret from everyone, including the coach, during their sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining strict confidentiality is a cornerstone of ethical coaching. Coaching siblings creates a significant risk of perceived or actual conflicts of interest and makes it extremely difficult to ensure complete confidentiality for both parties. The most ethical approach is to decline coaching Sarah and provide referrals to protect the integrity of the coaching relationship with Mark and avoid any potential harm or breach of trust."

            "options": [
                "A wide selection of visually appealing virtual backgrounds for video calls.",
                "A robust, HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform with end-to-end encryption and secure authentication.",
                "An integrated payment processing system directly within the video call interface for immediate billing.",
                "Advanced screen-sharing capabilities specifically designed for multimedia presentations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While other features can be useful, a HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform with strong encryption is non-negotiable for online coaching involving sensitive personal information. This ensures that conversations remain private and secure, protecting client data and adhering to legal and ethical standards for confidentiality. Security and privacy must always take precedence."

            "question": "A faith-based marriage coach aims to establish themselves as a thought leader in pre-marital counseling within their community. Which marketing strategy would be most effective for achieving this goal?",
            "options": [
                "Running generic social media advertisements targeting all married couples without specific content.",
                "Consistently publishing high-quality blog posts, webinars, and perhaps a podcast focused on pre-marital topics, actively engaging in relevant online forums, and guest speaking at local church or community events.",
                "Offering significant, permanent discounts on all pre-marital coaching packages to attract a high volume of clients.",
                "Relying solely on passive word-of-mouth referrals without any active content creation or outreach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing thought leadership requires demonstrating expertise and providing value. Content marketing (blogs, webinars, podcasts) and public speaking position the coach as an authority in their niche. This strategy builds credibility, trust, and visibility, attracting clients who specifically seek expert guidance in pre-marital counseling."

            "question": "A successful faith-based marriage coach wants to scale their practice beyond one-on-one sessions. They are considering developing an online course on 'Building a God-Centered Marriage.' What is a key advantage of offering online courses compared to hiring additional coaches for one-on-one sessions?",
            "options": [
                "It generally requires less upfront time and financial investment to create.",
                "It offers a more direct, personalized relationship with each participant, similar to one-on-one coaching.",
                "It allows for significant passive income generation and reaches a wider audience without a direct, proportional increase in the coach's active working hours per participant.",
                "It completely eliminates the need for ongoing marketing and client acquisition efforts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Online courses are a powerful scaling tool because they decouple income from direct time investment. Once created, they can be sold to numerous individuals, generating passive income and significantly expanding reach without the coach needing to be actively present for each interaction, unlike hiring more coaches who still require active management and a per-hour commitment."

            "options": [
                "To legally guarantee specific positive outcomes for the client's marriage.",
                "To clearly outline the scope of services, fees, confidentiality protocols, cancellation policies, and professional boundaries, thereby protecting both the coach and the client and setting clear expectations.",
                "To legally bind clients to a minimum commitment of one year of coaching sessions.",
                "To primarily serve as a marketing document highlighting the coach's qualifications and testimonials."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A client service agreement is a vital legal and ethical document. Its primary purpose is to establish clear expectations and boundaries for the coaching relationship. It protects both parties by detailing services, fees, confidentiality, ethical guidelines, and procedures, minimizing misunderstandings and providing a framework for professional conduct."

                "Take on more clients to distract themselves from the feelings of fatigue and increase income.",
                "Actively seek regular peer supervision, professional consultation, or personal therapy to process challenges, receive support, and develop coping strategies.",
                "Ignore the feelings and focus solely on meeting the needs of their existing clients.",
                "Immediately refer all existing clients to other coaches and cease practice indefinitely without further reflection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice includes maintaining the coach's own well-being. Burnout can impair a coach's ability to serve clients effectively. Seeking supervision or personal therapy is a proactive and ethical step to address burnout, gain perspective, receive support, and ensure the coach can continue to provide high-quality, compassionate care. It demonstrates commitment to both self-care and client welfare."
