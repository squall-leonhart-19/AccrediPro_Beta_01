            "options": [
                "Supervision primarily focuses on accountability, ethical practice, and skill development, while mentoring emphasizes career guidance and broader personal growth.",
                "Supervision is always paid, while mentoring is typically pro bono.",
                "Mentoring is a formal process with a contract, whereas supervision is informal and ad-hoc.",
                "Supervision is exclusively for new coaches, while mentoring is for experienced practitioners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L1 distinguishes professional supervision as a structured, formal process focused on a coach's ethical practice, competence, and client outcomes, often involving direct review of work. Mentoring, while valuable, tends to be less formal, broader in scope, and often focuses on career trajectory, networking, and general professional wisdom rather than direct case review or ethical oversight."

            "question": "In L3, establishing the supervisory relationship, what is considered the most crucial element to delineate clearly in the initial supervisory contract?",
            "options": [
                "The supervisor's personal theological convictions.",
                "Specific marketing strategies for the supervisee's practice.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L3 emphasizes that a robust supervisory contract must clearly outline confidentiality parameters, ethical boundaries (e.g., dual relationships), and a transparent process for addressing any concerns or grievances. This establishes a safe, professional, and accountable framework for the supervisory relationship, protecting both parties and the clients."

            "question": "A supervisee presents a complex case where a client's spiritual beliefs are directly contributing to marital conflict, and the supervisee feels their own theological stance is being challenged. According to L5 on navigating ethical dilemmas, what is the supervisor's most appropriate initial action?",
            "options": [
                "Directly advise the supervisee on which theological position the client should adopt.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L5 stresses that in faith-based coaching, supervisors must help supervisees navigate their own theological biases and countertransference. The most appropriate initial action is to facilitate a reflective process, encouraging the supervisee to examine their personal responses and the ethical considerations of maintaining client-centered, non-judgmental support, even when beliefs differ significantly."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L2 highlights the Developmental Model of supervision (e.g., Stoltenberg & Delworth) as particularly effective for adapting supervisory interventions to the supervisee's stage of professional development.

            "question": "When assessing coach competence and fostering development (L4), a supervisor wants to evaluate a supervisee's actual in-session communication skills and application of coaching models. Which method provides the most direct and comprehensive insight for this purpose?",
            "options": [
                "Reviewing the supervisee's self-assessment forms.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L4 emphasizes that while self-assessments and theoretical discussions are useful, analyzing audio or video recordings of actual coaching sessions provides the most direct and comprehensive insight into a supervisee's in-session communication, skill application, and adherence to coaching models. This allows for specific, actionable feedback."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L6 advocates for critical incident analysis as a powerful reflective tool. By focusing on a challenging case and the supervisee's emotional and spiritual responses, the supervisor can help uncover stressors, explore coping mechanisms, and guide the development of specific self-care and spiritual resilience strategies to combat burnout and compassion fatigue."

                "It eliminates the need for individual supervision altogether.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L7 highlights that group supervision offers distinct benefits such as exposure to diverse perspectives, robust peer support, and a valuable sense of community among coaches. This collective environment allows for shared learning, normalization of challenges, and the integration of varied faith-based insights, enriching the supervisory experience beyond what individual supervision alone can provide."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L8 emphasizes that a personal supervision philosophy must articulate the supervisor's core values, the theological underpinnings that inform their practice, and their preferred theoretical models. This clarity ensures consistency, transparency, and intentionality in how they approach the development and support of their supervisees within a faith-based context."

            "question": "A recent survey referenced in L1 and L5 indicated that 35% of faith-based coaches reported experiencing <span class=\"highlight\">spiritual bypass</span> in their clients. In a supervisory context, how should a supervisor guide a supervisee who encounters this phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the supervisee to dismiss the client's spiritual claims as irrelevant.",
                "Encourage the supervisee to reinforce the client's spiritual bypass as a coping mechanism.",
                "Help the supervisee discern between authentic spiritual coping and spiritual bypass, guiding them to gently explore the client's avoidance of psychological processing through spiritual means, and to foster holistic growth.",
                "Suggest the supervisee become the client's spiritual director."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L1 and L5 both address the unique ethical challenge of spiritual bypass. The supervisor's role is to help the supervisee understand and address this phenomenon by distinguishing it from healthy spiritual coping. This involves guiding the supervisee to gently explore how the client might be using spirituality to avoid difficult emotions or psychological work, thereby fostering more integrated and holistic client growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L4 discusses various feedback models, with the SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) Model being highlighted for its effectiveness. It provides specific, objective feedback by describing the Situation, the observable Behavior, and the Impact of that behavior. This approach makes feedback less personal, more actionable, and clearly links actions to consequences, fostering a learning-oriented environment."
