            "question": "A blended family couple seeks coaching. The stepmother expresses frustration that her husband consistently sides with his biological children during disagreements, undermining her authority. What is the most effective initial faith-based coaching strategy to address this <span class=\"highlight\">loyalty conflict</span>?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the stepmother to assert more authority regardless of her husband's stance.",
                "Encourage the husband to establish clear boundaries with his biological children, even if it causes immediate friction.",
                "Facilitate a discussion on shared family values and the biblical principle of 'leaving and cleaving,' helping the couple present a united front and define new family roles.",
                "Suggest separate counseling for the husband and his biological children to resolve their underlying issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most effective initial strategy is to foster unity and a shared vision. By discussing shared family values and the biblical principle of 'leaving and cleaving' (Genesis 2:24), the coach helps the couple prioritize their marital bond and present a united front, which is crucial for addressing loyalty conflicts in blended families. Options A, B, and D are either counterproductive or premature."

            "question": "A wife in recovery from opioid addiction, supported by her husband, frequently relies on him to manage all household finances and child-rearing, fearing relapse if she takes on too much. The husband feels overwhelmed but is afraid to burden her. From a faith-based perspective, what is the most appropriate coaching intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the husband to continue managing everything to prevent relapse, emphasizing his sacrificial role.",
                "Counsel the wife to immediately take on full responsibility for household tasks to demonstrate commitment to recovery.",
                "Guide the couple to identify signs of <span class=\"highlight\">codependency</span> and establish healthy, gradual steps for shared responsibilities, emphasizing mutual support, trust in God's strength, and sustainable recovery.",
                "Recommend the couple seek legal separation until the wife is fully independent in her recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario highlights codependency, where the husband's efforts to 'help' inadvertently hinder the wife's full recovery and self-efficacy, while also causing his own burnout. A faith-based coach should guide them toward healthy interdependence, gradually reintroducing shared responsibilities, and relying on spiritual strength, rather than enabling or demanding immediate, unrealistic changes."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "A client who experienced severe emotional abuse in her marriage is struggling with the concept of 'forgiveness' as taught in her church, feeling pressured to reconcile with her unrepentant abuser. As a faith-based coach, how should you best guide her?",
            "options": [
                "Emphasize that biblical forgiveness always requires immediate reconciliation for true healing.",
                "Clarify that <span class=\"highlight\">forgiveness is an internal process of releasing bitterness</span> and extending grace, while reconciliation requires repentance, changed behavior, and demonstrated safety from the abuser.",
                "Advise her to separate from her church community if they are pressuring her towards reconciliation.",
                "Instruct her to pray for her abuser until she feels ready to reconcile, regardless of his actions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It is critical for a faith-based coach to distinguish between forgiveness and reconciliation, especially in cases of abuse. Forgiveness is an internal act of the will that releases the victim from the burden of bitterness, while reconciliation is a relational process that requires the abuser's genuine repentance, changed behavior, and a restored sense of safety for the victim. Pressuring reconciliation without these conditions can be re-traumatizing."

            "question": "A couple is grieving a third miscarriage. The wife expresses her grief openly, seeking support groups and spiritual guidance, while the husband has become withdrawn, focusing intensely on work and avoiding discussions about their loss. What is a key consideration for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "The husband's coping mechanism is unhealthy and should be immediately challenged as avoidance.",
                "The wife should be encouraged to give her husband space and wait for him to initiate discussions.",
                "Acknowledge that men and women often grieve differently, and facilitate open communication about their individual needs and shared spiritual struggle, validating both responses and encouraging mutual support.",
                "Suggest they both focus on finding a new fertility treatment plan to move past the grief."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grief manifests uniquely in individuals, and gender differences in coping are common, with men often internalizing grief more. A sensitive coach validates both partners' experiences, creates a safe space for them to express their differing needs, and helps them understand and support each other through their shared loss, integrating their faith as a resource for coping."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "An interfaith couple (one Christian, one Muslim) is expecting their first child and is deeply divided on how to raise the child spiritually. The husband wants the child to attend mosque, while the wife wants the child baptized. What is the most constructive faith-based coaching approach?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage one partner to convert to the other's faith for family unity.",
                "Advise them to raise the child without any religious instruction until they are old enough to choose.",
                "Facilitate a discussion on their core spiritual values, explore practical compromises (e.g., exposing the child to both traditions respectfully, defining shared moral principles), and emphasize mutual respect and prayer for divine guidance.",
                "Suggest they each raise the child in their own faith separately, creating two distinct religious environments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For interfaith couples, forcing conversion or avoiding religious instruction often leads to resentment or spiritual void. The most constructive approach involves deep dialogue about core values, identifying areas of common ground (e.g., ethics, compassion), and seeking creative, respectful compromises that honor both traditions while establishing a cohesive family identity, guided by prayer and mutual respect."

            "question": "A wife has been the primary caregiver for her husband with early-onset Parkinson's disease for five years. She expresses profound exhaustion, resentment towards God, and feelings of isolation. Her husband feels guilty and helpless. What is the most vital coaching intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Reassure her that God has a plan and she must endure her cross without complaint.",
                "Advise the husband to take on more caregiving duties immediately, despite his physical limitations.",
                "Validate her feelings of grief, anger, and spiritual doubt, explore practical support systems (e.g., respite care, community support), and gently guide her towards reframing her spiritual struggle through <span class=\"highlight\">lament</span> and finding God's presence in suffering.",
                "Recommend individual therapy for the wife to address her spiritual crisis separately from the marriage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Caregiver burnout and spiritual questioning are common in chronic illness. Dismissing or minimizing her feelings (Option A) is unhelpful. Forcing the husband (Option B) is impractical. Isolating her (Option D) avoids the marital impact. The coach must validate her complex emotions, help access practical support, and guide her in integrating her faith, including the biblical practice of lament, to process her suffering without feeling abandoned by God."

            "question": "A couple faces significant credit card debt. The husband is a spender and hides purchases, while the wife is a saver and feels betrayed by his lack of transparency. Their differing 'money scripts' are causing constant conflict. What is the initial, critical step for a faith-based coach?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately create a strict budget and demand adherence from both partners.",
                "Focus solely on the husband's spending habits, as he is the primary cause of the debt.",
                "Facilitate a non-judgmental discussion to uncover their individual <span class=\"highlight\">money scripts</span>, explore the biblical principles of stewardship and transparency, and collaboratively establish a shared financial vision rooted in trust and mutual accountability.",
                "Advise the wife to take sole control of all finances to prevent further debt accumulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing financial issues requires more than just a budget; it necessitates understanding underlying attitudes and beliefs about money (money scripts). The initial critical step is to foster open communication, uncover these scripts, align them with biblical stewardship principles, and build a foundation of trust and shared vision, rather than assigning blame or imposing unilateral control."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "A military couple is struggling with reintegration after the husband's 12-month deployment. He feels disconnected and irritable, preferring solitude, while his wife feels abandoned and struggles with his changed routines. What is a key aspect of faith-based coaching for this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend the husband immediately seek individual therapy for PTSD, as his behavior is indicative of trauma.",
                "Encourage the wife to be patient and allow her husband to adjust at his own pace, without intervention.",
                "Help the couple understand common <span class=\"highlight\">reintegration challenges</span>, facilitate open communication about their individual experiences and expectations, and encourage shared spiritual practices to reconnect and rebuild intimacy.",
                "Advise them to separate temporarily to reduce immediate marital stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reintegration after deployment is a complex process with predictable challenges. While PTSD screening may be necessary, the immediate coaching focus is on normalizing their experiences, enhancing communication, and leveraging their faith to bridge the emotional and spiritual distance created by separation. Shared spiritual practices can be powerful tools for reconnection."

            "question": "A new blended family is experiencing significant friction. The stepchildren, who previously experienced neglect in their biological father's home, are resistant to the new stepfather's attempts to establish consistent rules. The stepfather, unaware of the trauma, feels disrespected. What is the most appropriate faith-based coaching approach?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the stepfather to assert his authority more strongly, emphasizing the biblical principle of respect for elders.",
                "Focus on immediate discipline for the stepchildren's resistance.",
                "Educate the stepfather on the potential impact of past trauma on behavior, help the couple establish <span class=\"highlight\">trauma-informed parenting strategies</span>, and encourage prayer for patience, empathy, and understanding.",
                "Suggest that the biological parent handle all discipline for their own children to avoid conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In blended families, especially where children have experienced trauma, seemingly defiant behavior can be a trauma response. A faith-based coach must help the couple understand this dynamic, implement trauma-informed parenting that prioritizes safety and connection before strict discipline, and lean on spiritual virtues like patience and empathy to build trust."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A couple has faced years of infertility treatments, followed by a diagnosis of a severe chronic illness for one spouse. They express deep anger and confusion towards God, questioning His goodness and purpose. As a faith-based coach, what is the most empathetic and constructive response?",
            "options": [
                "Reassure them that God works all things for good and their suffering will eventually make them stronger.",
                "Encourage them to read specific scriptures on joy and perseverance to overcome their negative feelings.",
                "Validate their feelings of lament and spiritual doubt as a natural part of profound suffering, create a safe space for honest spiritual exploration, and guide them towards understanding God's presence even in unanswered prayers and pain.",
                "Suggest they focus on practical solutions and avoid dwelling on theological questions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In prolonged suffering, it is common and healthy for individuals to experience spiritual doubt and anger (lament). A faith-based coach's role is not to offer platitudes or dismiss their feelings, but to validate their pain, provide a safe space for honest spiritual wrestling, and help them discover God's enduring presence and compassion within their suffering, rather than demanding immediate positive reframing."
