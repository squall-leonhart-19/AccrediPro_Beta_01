            "options": [
                "Exploring the couple's spiritual disciplines and prayer life.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In any crisis, the immediate priority for a coach is to ensure the physical and psychological safety of all individuals involved, establishing stability before addressing deeper issues. This aligns with foundational crisis intervention principles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Any statement indicating suicidal ideation, even indirect, necessitates an immediate and thorough suicide risk assessment. Developing a safety plan and referring to a mental health professional are critical ethical and safety responses, as this goes beyond the scope of coaching."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Full and transparent disclosure, though painful, is a critical step in rebuilding trust after infidelity. Resistance to this often stalls the healing process, as the betrayed spouse cannot truly move forward without understanding the scope of the betrayal."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In cases of addiction, partners often unknowingly engage in enabling behaviors. A crucial role of the coach is to help the spouse establish healthy boundaries, which can disrupt the addiction cycle and promote the addict's accountability and motivation for change."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While confidentiality is paramount, it has limits, especially when illegal activities or harm are involved.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The primary distinction is scope of practice. Licensed therapists are trained and legally authorized to diagnose and treat mental health disorders, while coaches work with clients on goals, skill development, and growth, typically within a framework where the clients are considered psychologically healthy."
