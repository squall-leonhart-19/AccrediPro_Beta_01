            "question": "In Palliative and End-of-Life care, what is the primary therapeutic goal of facilitating a 'Legacy Project' such as a hand-cast or a memory book?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the patient from physical pain symptoms",
                "To provide the patient with a sense of meaning-making and continuity of self",
                "To diagnose late-stage cognitive decline through artistic output",
                "To encourage the patient to ignore their terminal prognosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Legacy projects in palliative care focus on 'meaning-making,' allowing the patient to consolidate their life story and provide a tangible connection for their loved ones, which supports dignity and continuity of self."

            "question": "When working with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) survivors in Neuro-Art Therapy, why is 'structured sequencing' in art tasks preferred over completely open-ended prompts?",
            "options": [
                "Open-ended prompts are too expensive to facilitate",
                "TBI survivors usually have superior executive functioning",
                "Structured tasks help compensate for executive dysfunction and reduce cognitive overload",
                "Sequencing is only used to test for color blindness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TBI often impacts executive functions like planning and organization. Structured, step-by-step art tasks provide the necessary scaffolding to help the brain re-learn sequencing without causing overwhelming frustration."

            "question": "In Somatic Art Therapy for chronic pain management, the technique of 'Externalizing the Pain' involves drawing the pain as an object or entity. What is the psychological benefit of this?",
            "options": [
                "It physically removes the pain from the body",
                "It helps the client view the pain as a separate entity, reducing its total control over their identity",
                "It proves to doctors that the pain is 'all in the head'",
                "It is used primarily to improve the client's drawing skills"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization creates a 'therapeutic distance' between the individual and their suffering. By viewing the pain as an object on paper, the client can shift from 'I am pain' to 'I am a person experiencing this pain,' which increases their sense of agency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-security forensic settings, safety is paramount. Facilitators must strictly account for all materials and avoid items like wire, certain solvents, or sharp tools that could compromise the safety of the unit."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Body mapping allows clients to project their internal sensations and perceptions onto a life-sized outline, helping them visualize and process the discrepancy between their 'felt' body and their physical reality."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alexithymia is common in addiction recovery. Art therapy provides a non-verbal bridge that helps clients identify and 'name' emotions through color, shape, and imagery before they are ready to speak about them."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mask making allows veterans to explore the duality of their experience—showing the 'face' they present to the world versus the hidden pain or 'moral injury' they carry inside, facilitating a safe disclosure of complex trauma."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
