            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory in Lesson 1, which physiological state must the 'Creative Container' facilitate to allow for authentic emotional expression and neuroplasticity?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventral Vagal state (Social Engagement System)",
                "The Sympathetic state (Fight or Flight)",
                "The Dorsal Vagal state (Shutdown/Freeze)",
                "The Hyper-arousal state (High Anxiety)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' state. Only when a client feels physiologically safe can they access the creativity and vulnerability needed for the therapeutic process."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Lesson 2 emphasizes sensory-based prompts. Why are these effective at bypassing 'cognitive resistance' in clients?",
            "options": [
                "They force the client to think harder about their problems",
                "They engage the limbic system and brainstem before the prefrontal cortex can 'censor' the output",
                "They require advanced artistic skill which distracts the mind",
                "They focus exclusively on the client's verbal narrative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory inputs (texture, smell, color) travel through the lower brain centers first, allowing emotions to emerge before the analytical prefrontal cortex can rationalize or suppress them."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3 (Navigate), what is the recommended approach for 'Decoding Symbolic Imagery'?",
            "options": [
                "Using a universal dream dictionary to tell the client what their symbols mean",
                "Ignoring the symbols and focusing only on the colors used",
                "Collaboratively exploring the client's 'personal lexicon' and what the symbol means to them",
                "Telling the client their drawing is a sign of a specific clinical disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Facilitators should avoid 'expert-led' interpretation. Instead, they help the client navigate their own internal meaning-making process, often referred to as their personal lexicon."

            "id": "q7_4",

                "Test if the client is experiencing hallucinations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Giving the artwork a 'voice' allows the client to externalize their emotions, creating a 'Third Object' perspective that makes difficult feelings easier to discuss."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 focuses on 'Bridging.' What does the term 'Isomorphic Link' refer to in this context?",
            "options": [
                "The chemical bond between different types of acrylic paint",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An isomorphic link is a bridge where the 'form' of the art (e.g., a barrier or a bridge) mirrors the 'form' of a real-world situation or emotional state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable change happens when the symbolic breakthrough in the studio is tethered to a specific, repeatable action or ritual in the client's real-world environment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Facilitators are not licensed to provide clinical diagnoses. Their role is to support the creative process and personal growth, not to treat or label pathology."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "C.A.N.V.A.S. stands for Context, Affect, Narrative, Visuals, Action, and Synthesis. 'Affect' records the client's observable emotional state during the session."

                "Ask the client why they are being difficult"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When the cognitive mind stalls, returning to the 'Sensory' level (Lesson 2) helps ground the client and re-engages the creative process without the pressure of 'meaning.'"
