            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In the architecture of the CANVAS Framework™, what is the primary purpose of the 'Navigate' phase (Phase 3)?",
            "options": [
                "To establish a safe therapeutic container through breathing exercises.",
                "To objectively observe and map the symbolic patterns and spatial relationships within the artwork.",
                "To translate the artwork into a written action plan for the coming week.",
                "To engage the inner critic through structured artistic critique."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 3 (Navigate) is about 'Deciphering Symbolic Patterns.' It focuses on objective observation, identifying recurring motifs, and understanding the spatial relationships within the image before moving into dialogue."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Phase 1 (Center) utilizes 'Bottom-Up' processing. According to the module, why is this essential before artistic creation begins?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the facilitator to assess the client's technical drawing skills.",
                "It ensures the client is in a state of 'Hyper-arousal' to maximize creativity.",
                "It stabilizes the nervous system and brings the client into the 'Window of Tolerance' to prevent flooding.",
                "It bypasses the limbic system to focus purely on logical analysis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bottom-Up processing in the Center phase focuses on physiological grounding. This stabilizes the nervous system, ensuring the client remains within their Window of Tolerance during the potentially evocative 'Activate' phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "During Phase 2 (Activate), a facilitator suggests the client use their non-dominant hand. What is the neuro-psychological rationale for this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To decrease the speed of the session and save on art supplies.",
                "To disrupt 'Top-Down' cognitive control and the 'Inner Critic,' facilitating subconscious expression.",
                "To improve bilateral coordination and fine motor skills.",
                "To ensure the artwork remains abstract and unrecognizable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using the non-dominant hand is a key technique in Phase 2 to bypass the dominant hemisphere's logical control and the 'inner critic,' allowing for more raw, subconscious imagery to emerge."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Which specific facilitation prompt is most characteristic of Phase 4 (Voice)?",
            "options": [
                "'What colors would you like to use today?'",
                "'On a scale of 1-10, how grounded do you feel right now?'",
                "'If this jagged shape had a voice, what would it say to the rest of the drawing?'",
                "'How can you apply this shape to your career goals tomorrow?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 4 (Voice) focuses on Facilitating the Image Dialogue. Asking the image (or a specific shape within it) to speak using prosopopoeia is a hallmark of this stage."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In Phase 5 (Align), the facilitator helps the client bridge the 'Symbolic-Somatic Gap.' What does this mean in practice?",
            "options": [
                "Connecting the symbols in the art to the client's current life roles and future aspirations.",
                "Measuring the physical distance between the client and their canvas.",
                "Ignoring the art and focusing strictly on physical exercise.",
                "Ensuring the client's posture matches the shapes in the artwork."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Align (Phase 5) is about integration. It bridges the gap between the insights gained from the symbols and the client's real-world identity, goals, and daily life."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Phase 6 (Shift) requires the creation of a 'Micro-Action.' According to the CANVAS methodology, a Micro-Action must be:",
            "options": [
                "A major life change, such as quitting a job or moving.",
                "A symbolic gesture that stays within the art studio.",
                "A tangible, small-scale task derived from the session's insight, completed within 48-72 hours.",
                "A repetitive drawing exercise to be performed for 30 days."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Shift' phase transforms insight into action. A Micro-Action must be tangible, small enough to be achievable, and performed shortly after the session to anchor the psychological shift."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "In the Master Facilitation lesson (L8), 'The Pendulation Technique' is used when a client becomes overwhelmed. What does this involve?",
            "options": [
                "Ending the session immediately and referring to a psychiatrist.",
                "Oscillating the client's attention between a 'resource' (safe spot) and the 'stressor' (difficult image).",
                "Having the client swing their arms to release physical tension.",
                "Asking the client to redraw the image using only bright, happy colors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is a master facilitation skill where the facilitator guides the client to move between a state of relative safety (the resource) and the challenging material, preventing emotional flooding."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "The module cites a 2023 meta-analysis regarding the 'Voice' phase. What was the reported effect size (Cohen's d) for 'Increased Self-Agency' when using image-dialogue techniques?",
            "options": [
                "0.21 (Small effect)",
                "0.45 (Moderate effect)",
                "0.78 (Large effect)",
                "1.20 (Very large effect)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As noted in the research section of Lesson 5, the meta-analysis of image-dialogue interventions showed a large effect size (d=0.78) for increasing a client's sense of self-agency."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Marcus' identified a 'Wall' symbol in his Navigate phase. In the 'Align' phase, he realized this wall represented his inability to say 'no' to overtime. What is an appropriate Phase 6 (Shift) micro-action?",
            "options": [
                "Marcus will paint a new picture of a door in the wall.",
                "Marcus will write a 10-page essay on the history of walls.",
                "Marcus will decline one non-essential work request this Thursday.",
                "Marcus will quit his job by the end of the month."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Micro-Action must be a tangible, real-world application of the insight. Declining one non-essential request is a specific, manageable action that directly relates to the 'boundary' insight."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "If a facilitator skips the 'Center' phase and moves directly to 'Activate,' what is the most likely negative outcome for a client with a history of trauma?",
            "options": [
                "The client will produce art that is too high-quality for facilitation.",
                "The client may experience 'Affective Flooding' and become dysregulated because they lack a safe container.",
                "The client will become bored and lose interest in the session.",
                "The client will use too much paint, increasing overhead costs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without the 'Center' phase to establish grounding and safety, the 'Activate' phase can trigger 'Affective Flooding,' where the client is overwhelmed by subconscious material without the regulatory tools to process it."
