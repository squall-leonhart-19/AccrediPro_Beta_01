            "question": "During the 'Activate' phase, which neurological shift is most desirable to facilitate spontaneous creative expression?",
            "options": [
                "Increased activation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)",
                "Transient hypofrontality, reducing the inhibitory influence of the executive brain",
                "Decreased activation of the Limbic System to ensure purely logical output",
                "Total suppression of the Default Mode Network (DMN)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transient hypofrontality involves a temporary 'down-regulation' of the prefrontal cortex, which allows the individual to bypass the 'Inner Critic' and engage in spontaneous, flow-based expression."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client presents with high levels of agitation and feels 'emotionally flooded.' According to the principles of Material Selection (L5), which media should the facilitator provide first?",
            "options": [
                "Fluid watercolors and wet sponges",
                "Soft pastels and finger paints",
                "Resistive media like hard graphite pencils or tight-weave collage",
                "Loose, slippery oil pastels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resistive media provide high sensory feedback and require more motor control, which helps 'contain' high arousal and provides a sense of mastery and safety for an agitated client."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Donald Winnicott's 'Squiggle Game' (L6) is utilized in art therapy primarily to:",
            "options": [
                "Test a client's fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination",
                "Establish a 'potential space' where the client and facilitator can engage in mutual play",
                "Ensure the client creates a representational image that can be diagnosed",
                "Force the client to confront their inner critic through complex geometric shapes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Squiggle Game is a tool for building rapport and reducing resistance by entering a shared 'potential space' of play, bridging the gap between internal experience and external reality."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the context of Somatic Activation (L4), what is the primary goal of 'Body Mapping'?",
            "options": [
                "To create a scientifically accurate anatomical drawing of the human skeleton",
                "To externalize the 'felt sense' and identify where emotions are physically stored",
                "To practice drawing human proportions for better artistic skill",
                "To ignore physical sensations and focus solely on abstract color theory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body mapping allows clients to externalize interoceptive data—the 'felt sense'—making abstract physical sensations tangible and ready for navigation."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which specific technique from L3 is most effective for a client who is 'paralyzed' by the need for their art to look 'good' or 'perfect'?",
            "options": [
                "Using a ruler and compass to ensure precision",
                "Blind contour drawing or drawing with the non-dominant hand",
                "Watching a step-by-step tutorial on realistic shading",
                "Using high-quality, expensive oil paints to increase the stakes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blind contour and non-dominant hand drawing disrupt the brain's established motor patterns and perfectionistic 'check-loops,' making it impossible for the inner critic to demand realistic accuracy."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Flow State' research by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (L7), what happens when the challenge of an art task significantly exceeds the client's skill level?",
            "options": [
                "The client enters a deep state of Flow",
                "The client experiences boredom and disengagement",
                "The client experiences anxiety and potential shut-down",
                "The client automatically develops new neural pathways for skill acquisition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flow is found in the 'Goldilocks Zone.' If the challenge is too high for the skill level, it produces anxiety; if the challenge is too low, it produces boredom."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "What is the neurological benefit of 'Bilateral Stimulation' (L1) during the activation phase, such as drawing with both hands simultaneously?",
            "options": [
                "It forces the brain to stay entirely in the left hemisphere",
                "It promotes communication between the left and right hemispheres via the corpus callosum",
                "It increases the heart rate to stimulate a 'fight or flight' response",
                "It prevents the client from using any color in their work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bilateral stimulation encourages hemispheric integration, helping to bridge the gap between the non-verbal, emotional right brain and the verbal, analytical left brain."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When using Sensory-Based Prompts (L2), why might a facilitator use 'Auditory-to-Visual' translation (e.g., drawing to music)?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the room is not too quiet",
                "To bypass the verbal-logical brain and tap directly into rhythmic, kinesthetic expression",
                "To distract the client so they don't think about their problems",
                "To teach the client how to read musical notation through art"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory-based prompts act as a 'gateway,' bypassing the need for verbal explanation and allowing the client to respond viscerally to the rhythm and tone of the sound."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 8 (Transitioning), what is the 'Bridge' between the Activate and Navigate phases?",
            "options": [
                "A 20-minute break where the client leaves the room",
                "A period of grounding and observing the 'raw' marks made without immediate interpretation",
                "The facilitator telling the client exactly what their drawing means",
                "Throwing away the activation work and starting a new, 'clean' project"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition involves shifting from the 'doing' (kinesthetic/sensory) to 'seeing' (perceptual/cognitive), allowing the client to ground themselves before moving into meaning-making."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A client is working with wet clay and begins to pummel it aggressively. This is an example of which type of activation (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "Passive visualization",
                "Cognitive restructuring",
                "Kinesthetic-Sensory discharge",
                "Digital-symbolic representation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aggressive movement with clay represents a kinesthetic-sensory discharge, where the physical energy of an emotion is released through the resistance of the material."
