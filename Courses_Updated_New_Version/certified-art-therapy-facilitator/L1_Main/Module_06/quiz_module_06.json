            "question": "In the neurobiology of the 'Shift,' which brain region is primarily responsible for synthesizing the emotional, non-verbal insights from the right hemisphere into a structured, verbal narrative?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Left Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Brainstem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Left Prefrontal Cortex (LPFC) is the seat of executive function and language, playing a critical role in 'translating' the abstract, emotional content of the right hemisphere into a coherent narrative for integration."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "During Lesson 2 on Cognitive Reframing, what is the primary therapeutic goal of 're-authoring' a visual metaphor (e.g., transforming a 'prison' into a 'cocoon')?",
            "options": [
                "To improve the aesthetic quality of the artwork",
                "To ignore the client's original trauma",
                "To shift the client's internal narrative from one of victimhood to one of agency/growth",
                "To ensure the client finishes the session on time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Re-authoring visual metaphors allows clients to physically and psychologically manipulate their self-narrative, fostering a sense of agency and neuroplasticity."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A client creates an image of a 'stormy sea.' To build an 'Art-to-Life Bridge' (Lesson 3), which facilitator prompt is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "Why did you choose blue for the water?",
                "What is one micro-action you can take this week to be the 'anchor' in your own stormy environment?",
                "Do you think the storm will pass soon?",
                "Can you draw a sun in the corner to make it more positive?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective 'Art-to-Life' prompts translate abstract visual metaphors into concrete, actionable intentions that the client can implement in their daily life."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Why is the ritual of 'Titling the Work' (Lesson 4) considered a vital step in sealing the creative work?",
            "options": [
                "It makes it easier to file the artwork in a folder",
                "It allows the facilitator to grade the work",
                "It requires the brain to synthesize complex imagery into a symbolic linguistic concept, aiding integration",
                "It is a requirement for art exhibitions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titling forces a synthesis between the visual/emotional and the linguistic/logical, which is a key component of 'sealing' the shift into the client's consciousness."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, why do clients often experience 'Resistance' or a 'Return to Baseline' shortly after a major breakthrough?",
            "options": [
                "They are not committed to the process",
                "The psychological drive for homeostasis seeks to maintain the familiar, even if it is painful",
                "The facilitator used the wrong type of paint",
                "Art therapy is only effective during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychological homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a stable internal state. Rapid change, even positive change, can trigger resistance as the ego attempts to return to 'known' patterns."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-actions are small, manageable steps that reduce the 'activation energy' required for change, ensuring the client experiences success outside the studio."

                "To clean the brushes and palettes",
                "To ensure the client is emotionally grounded and the facilitator's own energy is cleared",
                "To collect payment for the session",
                "To tell the client what their art means"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Closing the container involves grounding the client so they can safely return to their day and clearing the facilitator's emotional space to prevent burnout and vicarious trauma."

                "A 10% reduction in heart rate",
                "The amount of art supplies used"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Qualitative measures focus on the depth and quality of the experience, such as changes in narrative, self-perception, and the integration of metaphors into life."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As noted in Lesson 4, structured integration rituals (like titling and storage) have been shown to increase insight retention by approximately 34% compared to sessions without a formal close."
