            "question": "What is the primary architectural purpose of the CANVAS framework in L1 Art Facilitation practice?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a clinical diagnostic tool for identifying underlying pathologies",
                "To create a structured, non-interpretive sequence that guides a client from regulation to actionable change",
                "To replace traditional talk therapy with purely non-verbal communication",
                "To ensure the facilitator maintains total control over the client's artistic output"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CANVAS framework is designed as a structured roadmap for L1 facilitators to guide clients through a safe, non-interpretive process that moves from nervous system regulation (Center) to sustainable life changes (Shift)."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (The Center Stage), which physiological state is identified as the 'Green Zone' required for creative entry?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Hyper-arousal state",
                "The Dorsal Vagal shutdown state",
                "The Ventral Vagal state of safety and social engagement",
                "The Alpha-wave meditative state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Center (C) stage focuses on regulating the nervous system into the Ventral Vagal state, which is the physiological prerequisite for curiosity, creativity, and openness to the process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "During the 'Activate' (A) stage, why does the facilitator encourage sensory engagement with materials like clay or finger paints rather than structured drawing?",
            "options": [
                "To bypass the 'Inner Critic' and cognitive resistance by focusing on kinesthetic experience",
                "Because L1 clients lack the motor skills for traditional drawing",
                "To save time during the session by using faster-acting materials",
                "To ensure the final artwork looks more professional for the 'Navigate' stage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensory-heavy materials engage the bottom-up processing of the brain, helping to bypass the cognitive 'Inner Critic' and intellectual resistance that often occurs when clients are asked to 'draw something.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Navigate' (N) stage protocols, which of the following is a 'clean' non-interpretive observation?",
            "options": [
                "'I see you used red here, which clearly represents your anger toward your father.'",
                "'The jagged lines in the corner suggest you are feeling anxious today.'",
                "'I notice there are three thick, blue vertical lines on the left side of the page.'",
                "'This image looks like a lonely tree, which means you are feeling isolated.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Navigate stage requires 'Decoding without Interpretation,' where the facilitator only identifies objective visual elements (lines, colors, shapes) rather than assigning psychological meaning."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "What is the core benefit of the 'Third-Person Dialogue' used in the 'Voice' (V) stage?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the facilitator to speak for the client",
                "It creates 'psychological distance,' making it safer for the client to explore difficult emotions through the artwork",
                "It speeds up the session by avoiding personal pronouns",
                "It helps the client disassociate from their problems entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By asking 'What does this shape want to say?' instead of 'What do you want to say?', the Voice stage uses externalization to reduce shame and defensive posturing, allowing for deeper insight."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the 'Align' (A) stage, if a client identifies 'strength' in a mountain they drew, what is the facilitator's next step?",
            "options": [
                "Agree that the mountain is indeed very strong",
                "Ask the client to draw a bigger mountain to increase the feeling",
                "Bridge the creative imagery by asking where that same 'mountain-like strength' exists in the client's daily life",
                "Interpret the mountain as a phallic symbol of power"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Align stage is about bridging: taking the qualities identified in the creative work and finding their real-world counterparts or applications in the client's current life goals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "The 'Shift' (S) stage is considered successful when:",
            "options": [
                "The client produces a high-quality piece of art",
                "The client identifies one micro-action or 'Shift' they can implement in the next 48-72 hours",
                "The client cries and releases emotional tension",
                "The facilitator provides a summary of the client's progress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Shift stage moves from insight to sustainable change by anchoring the session's discoveries into a specific, manageable action step for the client to take in the immediate future."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Which of these is a violation of L1 Ethics as discussed in Lesson 8 (Mastery and Ethics)?",
            "options": [
                "Refusing to interpret a client's dream imagery",
                "Using the CANVAS framework with a client who has a minor stress disorder",
                "Providing a clinical diagnosis of 'Depression' based on the dark colors used in a client's painting",
                "Referring a client to a licensed therapist when they disclose active suicidal ideation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L1 Facilitators must never diagnose or treat clinical pathology. Assigning a clinical diagnosis based on artistic choices is a major ethical boundary violation and outside the scope of L1 practice."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "According to the statistics mentioned in the 'Activate' module, sensory-based art activities can reduce salivary cortisol levels by approximately what percentage in just 45 minutes?",
            "options": [
                "15-20%",
                "75%",
                "About 50%",
                "Over 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research cited in the module (Kaimal et al.) indicates that 45 minutes of creative activity can lead to a significant reduction in cortisol (stress hormone) in roughly 75% of participants, with an average reduction near 50% for those in high-stress states."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client in the 'Navigate' stage says, 'I don't know what this means, it just looks like a mess.' What is the best L1 facilitator response?",
            "options": [
                "'It means you are feeling chaotic inside.'",
                "'Let's look at the mess. I see some red swirls and some heavy black marks. What do those specific marks feel like to look at?'",
                "'Don't worry, we'll try again with a different prompt.'",
                "'Maybe you should try to paint something more organized next time.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The facilitator should bring the client back to the phenomenological 'Navigate' protocol—focusing on the objective visual elements (swirls, marks) and the client's immediate felt sense, rather than searching for a 'meaning' or judging the work."
