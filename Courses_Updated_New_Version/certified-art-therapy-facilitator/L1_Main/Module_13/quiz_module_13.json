            "question": "What is the primary overarching goal of the C.A.N.V.A.S. Framework™ as taught in the methodology?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a structured, sequential process for moving from subconscious exploration to actionable life change.",
                "To teach clients the technical fundamentals of oil painting and color theory.",
                "To replace traditional talk therapy with a purely non-verbal diagnostic system.",
                "To ensure every client produces a gallery-ready piece of art by the end of the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The framework is designed as a sequential journey that bridges the gap between subconscious creative expression and tangible, real-world application."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In Phase 1: Center, the 'Psychological Container' is established. Why is this considered the most critical foundational step?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the facilitator to begin interpreting the client's personality immediately.",
                "It ensures the art materials are organized and aesthetically pleasing for the client.",
                "It establishes the safety required for the nervous system to move from 'fight or flight' into a state of creative play.",
                "It increases the client's heart rate to prepare them for the exertion of the 'Activate' phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Without a secure 'container' or psychological safety, the prefrontal cortex remains guarded, preventing the deep subconscious engagement required for the later phases."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Which specific technique is recommended in Phase 2: Activate to bypass the 'Inner Critic' and engage the subconscious?",
            "options": [
                "Precise anatomical sketching to focus the mind.",
                "Non-dominant hand scribbling or blind contour drawing.",
                "Providing the client with a complex color-by-number template.",
                "Asking the client to write a list of their flaws before they start painting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Techniques like non-dominant hand drawing disrupt the logical, perfectionist 'inner critic,' allowing more raw, symbolic material to emerge from the subconscious."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "During Phase 3: Navigate, if a client draws a 'jagged mountain range,' what is the most appropriate facilitator response?",
            "options": [
                "Explain to the client that mountains always represent a distant, cold father figure.",
                "Tell the client to smooth out the lines to make the image more positive.",
                "Ask an open-ended question such as, 'If you were standing at the base of these peaks, what would the air feel like?'",
                "Immediately move to the 'Shift' phase to avoid the discomfort of the image."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A C.A.N.V.A.S. facilitator remains a 'curious observer' and uses 'clean' questioning to allow the client to discover their own symbolic meaning rather than imposing an interpretation."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In Phase 4: Voice, the concept of 'Externalizing the Narrative' is used. What is the psychological benefit of this process?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the artwork more marketable for potential sale.",
                "It creates distance between the person and the problem, allowing them to view the issue as an external object they can influence.",
                "It forces the client to admit that their problems are purely imaginary.",
                "It ensures the client uses at least three different artistic mediums in one session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization (a concept from Narrative Therapy) allows the client to see that they are not the problem; the problem is an external entity that can be examined and shifted."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Phase 5: Align focuses on 'Bridging.' If a client identifies a 'heavy anchor' in their artwork, which question best facilitates Alignment?",

                "'What kind of metal is this anchor made of?'",
                "'Can you draw a boat to go with the anchor?'",
                "'In what area of your current daily life do you feel this same sense of being weighed down or stuck?'",
                "'Why didn't you use a brighter color for the anchor?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alignment questions connect the symbolic imagery directly to the client's current lived reality, making the abstract insight concrete."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "According to the framework, the Phase 6: Shift is only successful when which of the following occurs?",

                "The client commits to a tangible, real-world 'micro-action' based on their insight.",
                "The client receives a formal clinical diagnosis from the facilitator.",
                "The artwork is destroyed to symbolize 'letting go' of the past.",
                "The client agrees to attend at least 20 more sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Shift' phase translates the cognitive and emotional insight into neuroplastic change through a physical, real-world action step."

            "options": [
                "Referring a client to a licensed therapist when trauma emerges that is outside your scope of practice.",
                "Insisting that a specific symbol 'definitely' means the client is repressed, even if the client disagrees.",
                "Encouraging the client to explore multiple meanings for a single color.",
                "Setting clear time boundaries for the start and end of the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Facilitators must never impose their own interpretations or 'diagnose' symbols; the client is always the expert on their own imagery."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Marcus' (chronic stress), he drew a 'cracked dam.' By Phase 6 (Align), he realized the cracks were his lack of boundaries at work. What would be a valid Phase 7 (Shift) micro-action?",
            "options": [
                "Quitting his job immediately without a secondary income source.",
                "Turning off work notifications on his phone between 6:00 PM and 8:00 AM for one week.",
                "Painting over the cracks in the drawing to make the dam look stronger.",
                "Buying a more expensive set of paints to use at home."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Shift' action should be a manageable, tangible, and realistic step that directly addresses the insight (setting boundaries) in his real life."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Research cited in the module suggests that the 'Externalization' process used in the Voice phase can reduce emotional distress by what approximate range?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "30-45%",
                "85-95%",
                "0%, as it is purely an aesthetic exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses on narrative and art-based externalization techniques show a significant reduction in distress (30-45%) as clients gain a sense of agency over their challenges."
