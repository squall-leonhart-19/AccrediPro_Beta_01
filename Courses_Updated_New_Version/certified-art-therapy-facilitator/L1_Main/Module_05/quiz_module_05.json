            "question": "What is the primary function of the 'Align' phase within the broader facilitation framework?",
            "options": [
                "To interpret the client's subconscious trauma through Freudian analysis",
                "To bridge the gap between studio-based creative insights and external life applications",
                "To teach the client technical artistic skills for professional development",
                "To provide a clinical diagnosis based on the aesthetic quality of the work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Align phase is specifically designed to ensure that the breakthroughs made in the creative 'studio' environment are translated into actionable, real-world behavioral changes."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Decoding Symbols,' what is the recommended first step when a client identifies a recurring metaphor in their work?",
            "options": [
                "The facilitator should provide the standard dictionary definition of that symbol",
                "Ask the client to paint the symbol again using different colors",
                "Ask the client to describe the 'physical sensation' of that symbol in their current life context",
                "Ignore the symbol and focus solely on the color palette used"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Decoding requires moving from the abstract to the felt experience; asking for the physical sensation helps the client link the visual metaphor to their lived reality."

            "question": "According to the 'Creative Mapping' strategy in Lesson 3, what is the purpose of drawing 'The Landscape of Obstacles'?",
            "options": [
                "To discourage the client from pursuing goals that are too difficult",
                "To externalize internal resistance and visualize potential external barriers to goal achievement",
                "To improve the client's ability to draw perspective and depth",
                "To fill up the page so the map looks more 'complete' for documentation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visualizing obstacles allows the client to develop 'pre-emptive alignment,' creating strategies for resistance before it halts their progress in the real world."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "How does the 'Third Space' of art therapy facilitate the resolution of cognitive dissonance (Lesson 4)?",
            "options": [
                "By forcing the client to choose one belief over the other immediately",
                "By providing a physical space where the client is not allowed to talk",
                "By allowing conflicting beliefs to exist simultaneously on paper, reducing the need for immediate ego-defense",
                "By distracting the client from their problems through the joy of painting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Art provides a non-threatening container where cognitive dissonance (conflicting thoughts/values) can be observed objectively without the brain's typical defensive 'shutdown' response."

            "id": "q5_5",

            "options": [
                "The client's future goals and aspirations",
                "The people in the client's life who support them",
                "Core foundational values that provide stability and nourishment for actions",
                "The 'dead weight' or past traumas that hold the client back"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In values clarification, roots represent the foundational 'why'—the core values that must be healthy and acknowledged for the 'branches' (actions) to thrive."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "The 'Alignment Log' discussed in Lesson 7 requires tracking 'Resistance Levels' on a scale of 1-10. Why is this data point critical?",
            "options": [
                "To prove to the client that they are failing if the number is high",
                "To identify patterns where certain life contexts consistently trigger avoidance or dissonance",
                "To report the client's lack of progress to insurance providers",
                "To determine if the client needs to switch to a different art medium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tracking resistance helps the facilitator and client identify specific 'friction points' in the alignment process, allowing for more targeted creative interventions."

                "A client must finish their artwork within 72 hours of starting it",
                "The facilitator must complete documentation within 72 hours of a session",
                "The first micro-action toward alignment should be taken within 72 hours to capitalize on neural plasticity",
                "Cognitive dissonance will naturally resolve itself if ignored for 72 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 72-hour window is critical for moving from 'insight' to 'action,' ensuring the neural momentum generated in the session is anchored by a real-world behavior."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah realizes through her 'Creative Map' that her goal of 'starting a business' is blocked by a giant 'Iceberg of Perfectionism.' What is the most aligned next step?",
            "options": [
                "Sarah should stop the project because perfectionism is too difficult to overcome",
                "The facilitator should tell Sarah that her art style is already perfect",
                "Sarah should identify one 'imperfect micro-action' she can take this week to 'chip the ice'",
                "Sarah should paint over the iceberg so she doesn't have to look at it anymore"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alignment requires translating the visual insight (the iceberg) into a specific, manageable behavioral shift (the imperfect micro-action)."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Based on the statistics cited in Lesson 3, individuals who use visual 'Creative Mapping' are approximately how much more likely to maintain goal-alignment than those using text-only lists?",
            "options": [
                "10% more likely",
                "42% more likely",
                "85% more likely",
                "They are actually less likely because art is distracting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies in cognitive psychology (Matthews, 2015) suggest that the combination of visualization and written commitment increases goal achievement by roughly 42%."
