            "question": "In the 'Center' phase of the C.A.N.V.A.S. Framework™, what is the primary neurobiological goal of the psychological container?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate the sympathetic nervous system for high-energy creativity",
                "To down-regulate the amygdala and establish a 'neurobiology of safety'",
                "To maximize the production of cortisol to enhance focus",
                "To bypass the prefrontal cortex and enter an immediate trance state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Center' phase focuses on grounding and the psychological container to down-regulate the amygdala, ensuring the client feels safe enough to engage in creative exploration without triggering a fight-or-flight response."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "During the 'Activate' phase, why are sensory prompts (like using non-dominant hand drawing or tactile clay work) emphasized?",
            "options": [
                "To improve fine motor skills and artistic technique",
                "To engage the left hemisphere's verbal and logical processing",
                "To bypass cognitive resistance and the 'Inner Critic' by shifting to right-hemisphere processing",
                "To ensure the artwork meets professional aesthetic standards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory-based prompts help bypass the 'Inner Critic' and cognitive resistance often found in the left hemisphere, allowing the client to access deeper, non-verbal subconscious material."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A facilitator notices a client using heavy, jagged lines and dark, concentrated colors in the center of the page. According to the 'Navigate' phase, these 'Formal Elements' likely suggest:",
            "options": [
                "A state of complete emotional regulation and calm",
                "High emotional intensity, potential anger, or focused internal tension",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the 'Navigate' phase, formal elements like line quality (jagged/heavy) and color density provide clues to the client's internal state, often representing high intensity or tension."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Voice' phase uses personification and 'clean' language to allow the client to project meaning onto the image rather than the facilitator imposing interpretations."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Align' phase is the bridge where the abstract or symbolic breakthroughs achieved during art-making are translated into concrete life goals and behavioral changes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Shift' phase focuses on cognitive reframing, ensuring that the emotional and creative work is integrated into the client's long-term mindset and self-narrative."

                "Providing a complex reference image for the client to copy exactly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-stakes sensory prompts reduce the pressure of 'performance' and help re-engage the creative brain by lowering the barrier to entry."

            "options": [
                "It follows the natural arc of the nervous system from stabilization to exploration and finally integration",
                "It is alphabetical, making it easier for facilitators to remember",
                "It is designed to make the session last exactly 60 minutes",
                "The order is not significant and can be done in any sequence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The sequence (Center, Activate, Navigate, Voice, Align, Shift) mirrors the neurobiological process of establishing safety, accessing the subconscious, exploring meaning, and integrating change."
