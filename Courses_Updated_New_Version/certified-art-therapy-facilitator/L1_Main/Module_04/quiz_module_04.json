            "question": "What is the primary psychological objective of 'Externalization' within the context of the Voice module?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client identify more deeply with their symptoms",
                "To separate the person from the problem, viewing the issue as an outside entity",
                "To move internal emotions into a strictly logical framework",
                "To encourage the client to take full personal blame for their artistic output"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization is a narrative therapy technique that helps clients view their problems as separate from their identity, reducing shame and increasing the agency needed to address the issue."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Personification' is used to give an image a persona. Why is this step crucial before beginning a dialogue?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the artwork more valuable for potential sale",
                "It allows the facilitator to diagnose specific personality disorders",
                "It transforms an abstract feeling into a character that can be communicated with",
                "It ensures the client follows the facilitator's aesthetic preferences"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personification gives the 'externalized' problem a name, face, and personality, which bridges the gap between a vague emotion and a concrete entity that the client can interact with."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "During the 'Dialoguing Process' (Lesson 3), the facilitator asks the client to write a response *from the perspective of the image*. What is this technique called?",

                "Reverse Psychology",
                "Two-Way Scripting",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on Jungian Active Imagination, perspective shifting allows the client's subconscious to 'speak' through the image, often revealing insights that the conscious mind was suppressing."

            "id": "q4_4",

                "Give the externalized image a definitive voice and presence",

                "Correct the client's grammar and syntax"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'I Am' statement allows the image to declare its own nature, needs, and function, which helps the client understand the 'secondary gain' or protective function of their struggle."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A facilitator acting as a 'Witness' (Lesson 5) uses 'Mirroring.' Which of the following is the best example of effective mirroring?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective mirroring uses the client's own descriptors and vocabulary, ensuring the facilitator remains a neutral witness rather than an interpreter who imposes their own meaning."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Subconscious Scripts' are identified. What is a common sign that a client is operating from an 'Inner Critic' script?",
            "options": [
                "The client uses vibrant colors and experimental strokes",
                "The client expresses curiosity about the meaning of a symbol",
                "The client repeatedly apologizes for the 'messiness' or 'bad quality' of their art",
                "The client completes the exercise ahead of schedule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Apologizing for the aesthetic quality of the work is a hallmark of the 'Inner Critic' script, which prioritizes performance and perfection over expression and healing."

                "Instruct the client to stop the session and try again next week",
                "Ask the client to focus on the physical sensations of the block and 'paint the silence'",
                "Tell the client exactly what to draw to get them moving again",
                "Ignore the block and move on to a different module"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working with the 'silence' as its own form of communication helps bypass the resistance. Asking the client to depict the block itself often leads to a breakthrough."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, bridging 'Voice' to 'Insight' requires the client to move from 'What is this?' to:",

                "'How much will this cost to frame?'",
                "'What is this image teaching me about my current life?'",
                "'What would my therapist want to hear?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insight occurs when the client connects the metaphorical 'voice' of the artwork to their real-world circumstances and behaviors, transforming expression into actionable wisdom."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client draws a 'Black Hole' and says, 'It's just nothingness.' The facilitator asks, 'If this nothingness had a sound, what would it be?' This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Synesthesia-based inquiry to unlock 'Voice'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Using sensory-shifting questions (like assigning a sound to a visual) is a powerful tool in the Voice module to bypass intellectual defenses and access deeper subconscious material."

            "question": "Research cited in the module (Pennebaker, 1997) suggests that 'naming' or 'voicing' difficult experiences through creative writing and art can lead to:",
