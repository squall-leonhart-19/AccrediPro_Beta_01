            "question": "According to Lesson 1 on Ethical Foundations, what is the primary distinction between an Art Therapy Facilitator and a Clinical Art Therapist?",
            "options": [
                "Facilitators use oil paints while Therapists use watercolors.",
                "Facilitators focus on wellness, personal growth, and self-expression, while Therapists diagnose and treat clinical mental health pathologies.",
                "Facilitators are not required to obtain informed consent, whereas Therapists are.",
                "There is no legal or professional distinction between the two roles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The scope of practice for a Facilitator is centered on the 'wellness model,' focusing on growth and self-discovery rather than the 'medical model' of diagnosing and treating clinical disorders."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'The Container' is described as a somatic regulation tool. What is its primary purpose in a session?",
            "options": [
                "To store physical art supplies after a session is completed.",
                "To provide a metaphorical and physical boundary that helps the client stay within their 'Window of Tolerance.'",
                "To force the client to confront their most traumatic memories immediately.",
                "To limit the client's creativity to a specific size of paper."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Container acts as a regulatory framework that ensures the client remains within their Window of Tolerance, preventing emotional flooding or dissociation during the creative process."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 explains that art-making can bypass 'Cognitive Resistance.' Which neurological mechanism is responsible for this?",
            "options": [
                "Art activates the Prefrontal Cortex to increase logical reasoning.",
                "Art-making utilizes 'bottom-up' processing, accessing the limbic system and sensory memory before the analytical mind can filter the experience.",
                "Art-making shuts down the visual cortex to allow for better hearing.",
                "Art-making stimulates the medulla oblongata to increase heart rate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because art is a sensory and kinesthetic activity, it accesses the limbic system (emotional center) and bypasses the 'top-down' filters of the prefrontal cortex where cognitive resistance often resides."

                "The client's ability to draw realistically."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Formal elements are the non-symbolic components of the art—how the marks are made—which often reveal more about the client's internal state than the literal subject matter."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personification or Prosopopeia allows the client to externalize internal conflicts by giving a 'voice' to the elements on the canvas, leading to deeper psychological insights."

                "By destroying the artwork at the end of the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Shift occurs when the client uses the art-making process to experiment with new perspectives or behaviors, effectively 'rewiring' their neural response to specific stressors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
