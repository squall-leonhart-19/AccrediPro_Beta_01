            "question": "Which brain region is primarily bypassed during the 'Activate' phase of the C.A.N.V.A.S. Framework™ to reduce cognitive resistance and 'perfectionism'?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Activate phase uses sensory-based prompts to bypass the Prefrontal Cortex (the 'Gatekeeper'), which is responsible for logic, judgment, and cognitive resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In the 'Center' phase, establishing a 'Safe Container' is designed to keep the client within which physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-arousal",
                "Hypo-arousal",
                "The Window of Tolerance",
                "The Default Mode Network"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal zone of arousal where a client can process emotions without becoming overwhelmed (hyper-arousal) or shut down (hypo-arousal)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A facilitator asks a client to 'draw the texture of your current stress' using oil pastels. This is an example of which type of processing?",
            "options": [
                "Top-down processing",
                "Bottom-up processing",
                "Executive functioning",
                "Declarative memory retrieval"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing starts with sensory input (texture, color, movement) and moves toward cognitive understanding, which is a core principle of the Activate phase."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "During the 'Navigate' phase, a facilitator observes a client using very light pressure and faint, broken lines. In formal element analysis, this is most commonly associated with:",
            "options": [
                "High levels of repressed anger",
                "A state of manic energy",

                "Strong ego boundaries and confidence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In art therapy facilitation, line quality (pressure and continuity) is a formal element where faint or broken lines often correlate with low energy, hesitation, or uncertainty."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Voice' phase in the C.A.N.V.A.S. Framework™?",
            "options": [
                "To have the facilitator interpret the meaning of the art for the client",
                "To externalize the issue by treating the artwork as a 'Third Object' in a dialogic process",
                "To ensure the client uses vocal affirmations while drawing",
                "To correct the aesthetic mistakes made during the Activate phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Voice phase uses externalization to create distance between the client and their problem, using the artwork as a 'Third Object' to facilitate a dialogue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In the 'Align' phase, a client identifies a 'bridge' in their drawing. The facilitator's role is to help the client:",
            "options": [
                "Draw a better bridge using technical perspective",
                "Ignore the bridge and focus on the colors used",
                "Connect the symbolic 'bridge' to a specific therapeutic goal or real-life transition",
                "Analyze why bridges are common archetypes in Jungian psychology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Align phase is about 'metaphorical bridging'—linking the symbols discovered in the art to the client's actual therapeutic goals and life circumstances."

            "id": "q9_7",

                "Repeating the same trauma narrative over and over",
                "Cognitive reframing and committing to sustainable, incremental action steps",
                "Changing the medium from dry to wet materials",
                "Ending the session immediately after the art is finished"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Shift phase focuses on cognitive reframing and creating new neural pathways through actionable steps and narrative shifts."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "According to the Facilitation Ethics (L8), a Facilitator differs from a Clinical Art Therapist because they:",
            "options": [
                "Are not required to maintain confidentiality",
                "Focus on 'wellness and growth' rather than 'treating mental illness' or processing deep trauma",
                "Can prescribe medication if the art shows signs of depression",
                "Do not need to use a framework like C.A.N.V.A.S.™"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The scope of practice for a Facilitator is centered on wellness, personal growth, and skill-building, whereas clinical therapy involves diagnosing and treating mental health disorders."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "If a client begins to hyperventilate and becomes visibly distressed by an image they created, the facilitator should immediately return to which phase?",

                "Navigate",
                "Center",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client moves outside their window of tolerance, the facilitator must return to the 'Center' phase to employ somatic grounding and re-establish the safe container."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A facilitator notices they are feeling 'drained' and 'angry' after a session with a specific client. This is an example of ________ and requires professional supervision.",

                "Counter-transference",

                "Cognitive Dissonance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counter-transference occurs when the facilitator projects their own emotional responses onto the client or reacts to the client's process, necessitating self-care and supervision."
