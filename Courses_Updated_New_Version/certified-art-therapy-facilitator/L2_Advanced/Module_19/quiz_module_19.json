            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Connect phase focuses on establishing safety by down-regulating the amygdala's threat response, moving the client out of 'fight-or-flight' mode."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Why is the 'Voice' phase of the CANVAS Framework™ critical for trauma recovery based on neuroimaging research of 'speechless terror'?",
            "options": [
                "It activates the Broca's area to allow for verbal storytelling immediately.",
                "It bypasses the Broca's area to access non-verbal, sensory memories in the limbic system.",
                "It shuts down the visual cortex to prevent flashbacks.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the prefrontal cortex to ignore emotional input."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma often causes hypoactivation in the Broca's area (speech center). Art therapy allows clients to 'voice' their experience through imagery when words are unavailable."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "The 'Science of Externalization' suggests that placing a 'problem' onto paper creates 'psychological distancing.' What is the primary clinical benefit of this distance?",

                "It allows the client to ignore the problem entirely.",
                "It reduces emotional reactivity, allowing for objective analysis and cognitive reframing.",
                "It proves that the problem is not real.",
                "It ensures the facilitator takes full responsibility for the artwork."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization creates a 'buffer' that reduces the intensity of the emotion, enabling the 'Align' phase where cognitive reframing can occur without overwhelming the client."

                "Relying solely on the facilitator's memory of the first session.",
                "Using standardized pre- and post-intervention assessments (e.g., PHQ-9 or GAD-7).",
                "Asking the client if they 'feel better' at the end of every session.",
                "Only keeping the final artwork produced in the last session."
            ],
