            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Asking the client to redraw the same symbol multiple times until it is perfect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Amplification, a Jungian-based technique, encourages the client to expand upon a symbol's meaning through various lenses, deepening the therapeutic inquiry rather than reducing the symbol to a mere 'sign'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization helps the client view the problem (e.g., 'The Cloud of Depression' or 'The Anger Monster') as something outside of themselves, which reduces shame and increases their agency to change their relationship with the issue."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
