            "question": "During the process of 'Creative Synthesis,' which neurological structure is primarily responsible for facilitating the high-speed communication required to integrate right-hemisphere affective imagery with left-hemisphere linguistic labeling?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Corpus Callosum",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Corpus Callosum acts as the primary bridge between hemispheres, allowing the 'Synthesis' phase to move from raw visual emotion to integrated cognitive understanding."

                "Personal narratives are always conscious, while archetypes are always unconscious.",
                "Archetypes are inherited collective patterns, while personal narratives are the unique biographical meanings a client assigns to symbols.",
                "Personal narratives are only used in Level 1 work, while archetypes are for Level 2.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in professional practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis requires the facilitator to help the client bridge the gap between universal patterns (archetypes) and their specific, lived experience (personal narrative)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Isomorphism in art therapy refers to the 'same shape' or structure between the creative process and life changes, such as 'breaking a border' in art translating to 'setting a boundary' in a relationship."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic integration requires the alignment of visual insight with internal physical awareness (interoception) to ensure the change is 'grounded' in the nervous system."
