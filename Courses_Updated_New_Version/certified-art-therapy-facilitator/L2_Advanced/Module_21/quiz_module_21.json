            "question": "In the context of Art-Based Treatment Planning (L1), what is the primary function of the 'Roadmap' concept?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a rigid, unchangeable schedule for every session",
                "To create a collaborative, structured path that aligns artistic interventions with clinical outcomes",
                "To serve primarily as a legal document for insurance reimbursement with no clinical utility",
                "To standardize art therapy so every client receives the exact same sequence of directives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Roadmap' in treatment planning serves as a strategic guide that ensures art-based interventions are intentionally linked to the client's specific clinical goals and desired outcomes."

            "options": [
                "The client will feel more confident in social situations by the end of the year.",
                "The client will use art to express their feelings about people.",
                "The client will complete one 'social bridge' drawing per week for 6 weeks to identify three specific triggers for anxiety.",
                "The client will stop being anxious when talking to strangers after four art sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This goal is Specific (social bridge drawing), Measurable (one per week/three triggers), Achievable, Relevant (social anxiety), and Time-bound (6 weeks)."

            "options": [
                "High-fluidity media (like watercolor) should be used to encourage emotional flooding.",
                "Resistive media (like wood or hard clay) provides the necessary physical boundaries and 'containment' for safety.",
                "Media selection does not matter during the 'Center' phase, only the verbal discussion.",
                "Bright colors should be avoided to prevent overstimulation of the amygdala."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Center' pillar focuses on emotional safety and containment. Resistive media requires more motor control and provides boundaries, which helps stabilize clients with low regulation."

            "question": "According to the principles of 'Strategic Media Selection' (L4), which media would be most appropriate for a client who is overly rigid and needs to access the 'Kinesthetic/Sensory' level of the ETC?",
            "options": [
                "Fine-tip markers and graph paper",
                "Finger painting or wet clay",

                "Hard lead pencils (4H) for detailed sketching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluid and tactile media like finger paint or wet clay encourage sensory exploration and help break down rigid cognitive defenses by engaging the Kinesthetic/Sensory levels of the Expressive Therapies Continuum."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This connection facilitates the transition from the 'Voice' (the art-making/symbolic expression) to the 'Align' (the cognitive processing and integration of the insights gained)."

            "options": [
                "To shift the client to a different therapist",
                "To move from exploration of the past to the active implementation of new behaviors and coping strategies",
                "To shift from using dry media to using wet media",
                "To change the time of the therapy session to accommodate the facilitator"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Shift' phase is about transition and action—taking the insights gained in earlier phases and applying them to create behavioral change and neuroplasticity."

            "options": [
                "Direct trauma processing > Grounding > Termination",
                "Media exploration > Deep emotional dive > Stabilization",

                "Free expression > Interpretation > Homework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed planning must prioritize safety and stabilization (Center) before moving into the externalization of traumatic memories (Voice) and their eventual integration (Align)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reviewing the portfolio during termination allows the client to see a tangible record of their journey, reinforcing their progress and internalizing their capacity for change."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To bypass 'Align' dominance, the facilitator should use directives that are less 'controllable' and more spontaneous, such as abstract watercolor or blind contour drawing, to access deeper emotional 'Voice'."

                "It must be updated every single day by law",
                "It should be regularly reviewed and revised based on the client's evolving needs and progress",
                "It is only valid while the client is 'living' in the treatment facility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'living document' means the treatment plan is dynamic; facilitators must review and adjust goals and interventions as the client reaches milestones or as new clinical needs emerge."
