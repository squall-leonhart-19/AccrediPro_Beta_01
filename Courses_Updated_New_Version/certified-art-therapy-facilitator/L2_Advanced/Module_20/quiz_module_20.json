            "question": "According to the clinical foundations of art-based assessment, what is the primary purpose of using standardized scales like the FEATS rather than relying solely on intuitive interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a definitive psychiatric diagnosis without needing a DSM-5 manual",
                "To increase inter-rater reliability and reduce practitioner bias in clinical observations",
                "To replace the client's verbal narrative with a purely numerical score",
                "To shorten the duration of the intake process to under 15 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardized scales like the Formal Elements Art Therapy Scale (FEATS) are designed to improve inter-rater reliability, ensuring that different clinicians see the same structural elements rather than relying on subjective, intuitive 'hunches.'"

                "By measuring the height of the person vs. the width of the paper",
                "By counting the number of colors used vs. the number of raindrops",

                "By timing how long the client takes to draw the rain versus the person"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Kinetic' aspect of the KFD requires that family members be depicted performing an action, which reveals relational dynamics and functional roles within the family system."

                "A bridge that does not touch either side suggests a lack of reality testing or significant transition anxiety",

                "A bridge that is wider than it is long indicates a preference for group therapy",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the Bridge Drawing, a bridge that fails to connect to the landmasses (the 'sides') often indicates a deficit in ego strength or a sense of being 'stuck' between life stages or states of being."

            "question": "A 2021 study on the FEATS indicated that 'Space' usage (how much of the paper is filled) is a significant indicator. A score of '1' (minimal space used) is most frequently correlated with which clinical presentation?",
