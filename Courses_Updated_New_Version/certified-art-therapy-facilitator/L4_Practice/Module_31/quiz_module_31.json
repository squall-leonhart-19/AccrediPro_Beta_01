            "options": [
                "Visuals; the aesthetic quality of the facilitator's personal portfolio",
                "Value Proposition; the specific emotional or cognitive shift the client experiences",
                "Volume; the number of clients a facilitator can handle per month",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the CANVAS Framework™, 'V' stands for Value Proposition. It is critical because facilitators must communicate the specific transformation (the 'creative shift') a client will experience to differentiate themselves from general hobby classes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using 'Before and After' photos to imply a 'cure' is unethical for facilitators as it suggests clinical outcomes that cannot be guaranteed and ignores the subjective nature of the creative process."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
