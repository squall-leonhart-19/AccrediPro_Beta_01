            "question": "In Lesson 1, the transition from 'Practitioner' to 'Visionary' requires a fundamental shift in how the facilitator views their time. What is the primary focus of the Visionary mindset?",
            "options": [
                "Perfecting individual 1:1 creative techniques for every client",
                "Building systems and frameworks that deliver results without the founder's constant presence",
                "Increasing the number of hours worked per week to accommodate more clients",
                "Focusing exclusively on the artistic quality of the final product"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Visionary mindset focuses on 'working on the business' rather than 'in the business,' creating scalable systems and methodologies that allow the impact to grow independently of the facilitator's direct labor."

            "question": "When scaling through group facilitation (The Collective Canvas), what is the 'Social Proof' benefit that is often missing in 1:1 sessions?",
            "options": [
                "The facilitator can charge more per person",
                "The session takes less time to prepare",
                "Participants see others engaging in the creative process, lowering individual inhibitions and resistance",
                "It requires less artistic skill from the facilitator"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Group dynamics create a 'normalization' effect where participants feel safer taking creative risks because they witness their peers doing the same, accelerating the therapeutic process."

            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Premium Retreats, what is the primary driver of 'High-Ticket' pricing for creative immersions?",
            "options": [
                "The cost of the art supplies provided",
                "The luxury level of the hotel or venue",
                "The depth of the transformation and the curation of the end-to-end experience",
                "The number of hours of instruction provided"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Premium retreats are priced based on the 'Value of Transformation.' While the venue matters, the primary value is the curated, immersive journey that leads to a specific, high-impact outcome for the client."

            "id": "q35_4",
            "question": "In the context of Digital Scalability (L4), what is the defining characteristic of an 'Asynchronous' facilitation model?",
            "options": [
                "The facilitator and student must be online at the same time",
                "It requires a physical studio space",
                "Content is pre-recorded and accessible at the student's convenience, allowing for infinite enrollment",
                "It is delivered exclusively through 1:1 Zoom calls"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Asynchronous models allow for 'decoupled' delivery, meaning the facilitator records the content once and many students can consume it at different times, which is the key to digital scalability."

            "id": "q35_5",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Corporate clients (B2B) invest in wellness programs to solve specific business problems like turnover, burnout, and poor communication. Highlighting these outcomes demonstrates business value."

            "options": [
                "Service delivery is always more profitable",
                "Licensing allows other facilitators to pay you to use your methodology, creating passive revenue",
                "Service delivery requires a trademark, while licensing does not",
                "Licensing is only for digital products, not physical workshops"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licensing turns your 'how-to' (methodology) into an asset that others pay to use, allowing your brand to scale geographically and numerically without you being the one facilitating."

            "id": "q35_7",
            "question": "In Advanced Marketing (L7), 'Authority Positioning' suggests that a facilitator should move away from being a 'Generalist.' What is the goal of becoming a 'Category of One'?",
            "options": [
                "To be the cheapest option in the local market",
                "To compete with as many other facilitators as possible",
                "To be seen as the only logical solution for a specific, niche problem",
                "To stop using social media entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Category of One' positioning eliminates competition by narrowing focus so deeply that no one else offers the exact same specialized solution, allowing for premium pricing and easier marketing."

            "id": "q35_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Sustainable Systems.' Which of the following is an example of 'Backend Automation' that saves a facilitator time?",

            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "According to the Module 35 framework, why is 'Delegation' critical for a facilitator reaching the $100k+ revenue mark?",
            "options": [
                "Because the facilitator should stop doing art entirely",
                "Because low-value tasks (admin, basic editing) prevent the facilitator from doing high-value tasks (strategy, facilitation)",
                "Because it is required by tax law",
                "Because clients prefer talking to assistants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling requires the facilitator to focus on their 'Zone of Genius.' If they are bogged down by $20/hour administrative tasks, they cannot perform the $500/hour strategic or creative work that drives growth."

            "question": "A facilitator transitions from a $150/hour 1:1 session to a $2,500/month 'Creative Leadership' group program. This is an example of which scaling principle?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is Leveraged Facilitation. By moving from 1:1 to a group program, the facilitator increases their hourly rate significantly while providing value to more people simultaneously."
