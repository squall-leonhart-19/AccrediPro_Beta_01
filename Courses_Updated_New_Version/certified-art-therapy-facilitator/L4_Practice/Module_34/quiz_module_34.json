            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves sequencing interventions so that they build on one another, moving from low-risk tasks to more vulnerable, deep exploration as group cohesion grows."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Double-loop reflection looks at both the 'product' (the art) and the 'process' (how the group worked together), bridging individual and collective growth."

                "A personal attack on their expertise",
                "Communication about the participant's need for autonomy or fear of the process",

                "Evidence that the art materials provided are of poor quality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance is a form of communication. In a group setting, it often signals a need for safety, control, or a reaction to the group's current stage of development."
