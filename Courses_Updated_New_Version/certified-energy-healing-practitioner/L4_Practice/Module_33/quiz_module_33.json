            "question": "A practitioner tells a client, 'I can feel an energetic blockage in your gallbladder that suggests you have gallstones.' Which legal boundary has been crossed?",
            "options": [
                "Informed Consent",
                "Scope of Practice",
                "Marketing Substantiation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy healing practitioners must never diagnose medical conditions. Suggesting a specific medical diagnosis like 'gallstones' violates the professional scope of practice and enters the territory of unlicensed medicine."

                "A clear statement that energy healing is not a substitute for licensed medical or psychological care",
                "A list of all other clients currently being treated by the practitioner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To ensure informed consent, a PDS must explicitly state that energy healing is a complementary modality and does not replace professional medical or psychiatric diagnosis and treatment."

                "On a public cloud storage service like a basic Dropbox or Google Drive account",
                "Digital records are not subject to privacy laws if the practitioner is not a doctor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensitive health data must be encrypted and password-protected. If using third-party software, a BAA is required to ensure the provider also meets security standards."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "General Liability insurance covers 'slip and fall' accidents and third-party property damage. Professional Liability (Malpractice) covers claims arising from the actual healing services provided."

                "Testimonials regarding mental health are exempt from FTC regulations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires health claims to be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Simple disclaimers like 'Results not typical' are usually insufficient if the claim itself is unsubstantiated."

                "To ensure the practitioner is paid even if the client misses an appointment",
                "To shift the risk of certain losses or legal claims from the practitioner to the client",
                "To allow the practitioner to use the client's image in marketing"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The IRS and labor boards use specific criteria to determine classification. Misclassifying an employee as a contractor can lead to significant fines, back taxes, and legal penalties."

            "options": [
                "Advise them to stop if their energy feels balanced",
                "Suggest they cut the dose in half and monitor their energy",
                "Direct the client to consult with their prescribing physician before making any changes to medication",
                "Tell the client that energy healing makes medication unnecessary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Directing a client to change or stop prescribed medication is 'practicing medicine without a license.' Practitioners must always defer medication questions to the client's licensed medical provider."
