            "question": "During Lesson 1's 'Precision Scanning,' what is the primary indicator of an 'Energy Void' within the etheric layer of the biofield?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in localized temperature",
                "A sensation of 'hollowness' or lack of resistance to the practitioner's palm",
                "A rapid vibrating or tingling sensation",
                "An visual manifestation of bright white light"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An energy void is characterized by a lack of density or 'hollowness' where the biofield should be robust, indicating a depletion of vital force in that specific area."

                "Ancestral karma located in the 7th layer",
                "Deep-seated, stagnant 'sludge' in the secondary chakras of the joints",
                "Minor auric tears caused by environmental stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vortex Clearing technique uses high-velocity spiral movements to dislodge dense, stagnant energy that typically accumulates in the joints and secondary centers."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to 'Field Unification' (L3), what is the 'Golden Ratio' of coherence between the mental and emotional subtle bodies for optimal health?",

                "1:1 - Absolute equality in amplitude",
                "1.618 - The emotional body slightly larger than the mental body",
                "2:1 - Mental dominance for logical processing",
                "3:1 - Emotional dominance for sensory experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Field Unification utilizes the Golden Ratio (Phi) to ensure the emotional body provides the necessary 'fuel' and expansion for the mental body's 'form,' creating a harmonic resonance."

            "question": "In 'High-Vibrational Rejuvenate' (L4), a 2023 meta-analysis cited in the lesson showed that restoring the 'Vital Force Threshold' to above 80% resulted in what percentage increase in cellular ATP production?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "27%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restoring the vital force to an 80% threshold correlates with a measurable 27% increase in mitochondrial efficiency and ATP production, facilitating physical healing."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "During 'Resonance Calibration' (L5), if a practitioner detects a 'Flat' frequency in the Heart Chakra, which specific tuning protocol is recommended?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'flat' frequency indicates a lack of resonance; the 528Hz frequency is the standard for calibrating the heart center back to its natural harmonic state."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "The 'Empower Phase' (L6) introduces the '21-Day Bio-Resonance Loop.' Why is the 21-day mark critical for sustaining transformation?",
            "options": [
                "It is the time required for the physical blood cells to completely regenerate",
                "It is the minimum time needed for the etheric template to overwrite previous 'memory' patterns",
                "It is based on the lunar cycle for emotional regulation",
                "It allows the practitioner to charge for a full month of service"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The etheric template requires approximately 21 days of consistent new frequency input to fully overwrite old energetic 'memories' or habitual blockages."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heavy or sinking sensations in the solar plexus/stomach area often indicate the release of 'Somatic Anchors'—physical points where survival-based trauma was stored."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client named 'Marcus' experiences chronic brain fog. After the 'Field Unification' (L3) protocol, his mental clarity improves. What was the likely energetic mechanism?",

                "The closing of the crown chakra to prevent over-stimulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brain fog is often caused by 'jagged' or disharmonious mental body frequencies; unification smooths these patterns by syncing them with the emotional body."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "When 'Mastering the SOURCE Session' (L8), what is the recommended 'Practitioner Stance' to avoid energetic depletion?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Observer stance (20/80 split) ensures the practitioner remains grounded and present without taking on the client's energetic baggage or depleting their own reserves."
