            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, the 'Neutral State' is described as essential for accuracy. What is the primary benefit of achieving Heart-Brain Coherence during a scan?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to project their own healing energy more forcefully",
                "It increases the 'signal-to-noise' ratio, allowing for more objective perception",
                "It prevents the client from feeling the practitioner's hands",
                "It speeds up the scanning process to under five minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart-Brain Coherence minimizes the practitioner's internal 'noise' (biases and emotions), allowing them to perceive the client's field with greater clarity and objectivity."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When performing a Non-Local (Remote) Scan, which principle of quantum physics justifies the practitioner's ability to assess a client who is not physically present?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Quantum Entanglement suggests that particles (and by extension, energetic systems) once connected remain linked across space and time, allowing for remote assessment."
