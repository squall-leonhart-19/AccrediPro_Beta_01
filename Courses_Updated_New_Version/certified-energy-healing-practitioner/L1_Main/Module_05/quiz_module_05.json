            "options": [
                "To identify the initial energetic blockages in the client's field",
                "To fine-tune the client's frequency to match a specific intentional outcome after clearing",
                "To physically manipulate the client's muscle tissue for relaxation",
                "To conclude the session and disconnect from the client's energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calibration is the process of adjusting and fine-tuning the client's energetic frequency to align with a desired state or 'intentional resonance' after blockages have been released."

            "question": "According to the mechanics of entrainment, what happens when two oscillating systems with different frequencies interact?",
            "options": [
                "The weaker oscillator will always override the stronger one",
                "The two frequencies will cancel each other out, resulting in zero vibration",
                "The more powerful or stable oscillator will pull the other into synchronization",
                "Entrainment only occurs if the frequencies are already identical"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the physics-based process where a more stable or powerful rhythmic oscillator influences a weaker one to synchronize with its frequency."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client exhibits a 'jagged' Heart Rate Variability (HRV) pattern. Which state should the practitioner help them calibrate toward for optimal coherence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological coherence is characterized by a smooth, sine-wave-like HRV pattern, indicating a highly efficient state of heart-brain synchronization."

            "options": [
                "It is the moment the practitioner's intent becomes permanently stuck",
                "It is the point where the client's field resists any further change",
                "It is the stable synchronization between the practitioner's intent and the client's bio-field",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase-locking occurs when the client's energy field successfully synchronizes with the intended frequency, creating a stable and unified oscillatory state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calibrating the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis focuses on moving the client out of chronic stress (sympathetic dominance) into a balanced, homeostatic state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rubber-banding refers to the tendency of the bio-field to return to its previous 'homeostatic' state (even if dysfunctional) if the new frequency is not properly stabilized."

            "options": [
                "To absorb the client's low-frequency energy into their own body",
                "To maintain a highly stable, coherent, and high-vibration state to act as a reference frequency",
                "To talk the client through their childhood traumas",
                "To use as many different tools as possible to impress the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The practitioner must maintain their own coherence (the 'Reference Frequency') so the client's system can entrain to that higher, more stable state."

            "question": "During the integration of Calibration into the SOURCE flow, why is it vital to 'Calibrate' BEFORE the 'Embody' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Because Embodying an un-calibrated state could anchor in residual 'noise' or instability",
                "Because Calibration is the least important step and should be done quickly",
                "Because the client needs to be awake for Embody but asleep for Calibrate",
                "Because the SOURCE acronym requires it for alphabetical reasons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Calibration ensures the frequency is precise and harmonious so that when the client moves to 'Embody,' they are anchoring a high-quality, stable energetic state."
