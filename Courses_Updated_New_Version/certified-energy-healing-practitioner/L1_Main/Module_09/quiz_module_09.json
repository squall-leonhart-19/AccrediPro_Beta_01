        {
            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "According to Biofield Anatomy (L1), which structure is described as a 'double-vortex' electromagnetic field that facilitates the exchange of energy between the individual and the environment?",
            "options": ["The Toroidal Field", "The Nadis Network", "The Crystalline Grid", "The Etheric Template"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Toroidal field is the primary 'donut-shaped' electromagnetic flow that centers on the heart and governs the exchange of subtle energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "During the 'Scan' phase of the S.O.U.R.C.E. Method (L2), a practitioner detects a 'cold spot' 3 inches above the solar plexus. What does this typically indicate in an intuitive assessment?",
            "options": ["Hyperactive energy flow", "An energetic deficiency or blockage", "A recently cleared pathway", "High-frequency integration"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cold spots or 'voids' in the biofield typically represent areas of stagnation, depletion, or significant energetic blockages."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the 'Open' phase (L3), which technique is most effective for releasing 'stuck' emotional imprints from the outer layers of the auric field?",
            "options": ["Clockwise sealing motions", "Static pressure on the physical body", "Counter-clockwise clearing spirals", "Rapid rhythmic breathing for the practitioner"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Counter-clockwise motions are the standard 'Open' technique used to unwind, loosen, and release stagnant energy from the field."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Unify' phase (L4) in the S.O.U.R.C.E. framework?",
            "options": ["To disconnect the client from their physical body", "To restore field cohesion and bridge gaps between energetic layers", "To identify the root cause of childhood trauma", "To increase the client's heart rate for detoxification"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Unify' phase focuses on field cohesion, ensuring that the layers of the biofield are communicating and integrated after clearing work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "The 'Rejuvenate' Protocol (L5) emphasizes high-vibration infusion. Which specific frequency is cited in biofield research for its role in DNA repair and cellular restoration?",
            "options": ["417 Hz", "528 Hz", "741 Hz", "852 Hz"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "528 Hz, often called the 'Miracle' frequency, is widely recognized in energy medicine for its association with DNA repair and cellular rejuvenation."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "When applying 'Calibrate' strategies (L6), the practitioner is primarily focused on which outcome?",
            "options": ["Removing external entities", "Fine-tuning the frequency of the chakras to their optimal resonance", "Initial assessment of the client's symptoms", "Ending the session without client feedback"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calibration is the 'fine-tuning' stage where the practitioner ensures the cleared and unified field is vibrating at its highest possible signature."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "In the 'Empower' phase (L7), why is it critical to provide the client with 'Sovereign Maintenance' tools?",
            "options": ["To ensure the client becomes dependent on the practitioner", "To prevent the practitioner from feeling tired", "To help the client maintain their energetic boundaries and session results", "To fulfill legal requirements for energy healers"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Empower' phase transitions the healing from the practitioner to the client, giving them tools to maintain sovereignty and prevent re-absorption of old patterns."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Which researcher's work on 'bio-photons' (L1) provides scientific evidence that cells emit coherent light, which is influenced by their energetic state?",
            "options": ["Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp", "Dr. Bruce Lipton", "Dr. Masaru Emoto", "Dr. Rupert Sheldrake"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp's research into bio-photons confirmed that all living cells emit weak light, and the coherence of this light is a marker of health."

        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'leaky aura syndrome' (L2/L8), characterized by exhaustion and feeling 'drained' by others. Which S.O.U.R.C.E. phase should the practitioner emphasize to address this?",
            "options": ["Open", "Unify", "Calibrate", "Empower"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While all phases are used, 'Unify' is specifically designed to address leaks, gaps, and fragmentation in the field's structure."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "What is the correct professional sequence of the S.O.U.R.C.E. Method when conducting a full session (L8)?",
            "options": ["Scan, Open, Unify, Rejuvenate, Calibrate, Empower", "Open, Scan, Rejuvenate, Unify, Empower, Calibrate", "Scan, Unify, Open, Calibrate, Rejuvenate, Empower", "Empower, Scan, Open, Unify, Rejuvenate, Calibrate"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The S.O.U.R.C.E. acronym dictates the flow: Scan (Assessment), Open (Clearing), Unify (Cohesion), Rejuvenate (Infusion), Calibrate (Fine-tuning), and Empower (Maintenance)."
