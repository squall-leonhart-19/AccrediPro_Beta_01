            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "During an advanced biofield scan (L1), you encounter a 'viscous' or 'honey-like' density. According to the lesson on textures, what does this typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Acute physical trauma or inflammation",
                "Stagnant emotional processing or congested lymphatics",
                "High-frequency spiritual awakening",
                "A complete lack of energetic protection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Viscous or 'sticky' textures in the biofield are primary indicators of stagnation, often related to unprocessed emotions or physical congestion in the lymphatic system."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "When clearing multi-layered meridian blockages (L2), why is the 'Art of Opening' prioritized over 'Forceful Clearing'?",
            "options": [
                "Forceful clearing is faster but less professional",
                "Opening allows the body's innate intelligence to regulate the release, preventing a healing crisis",
                "Meridians cannot be cleared forcefully due to their physical structure",
                "Opening requires less energy from the practitioner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle 'opening' techniques respect the client's nervous system capacity, allowing for a sustainable release rather than triggering a sympathetic 'fight or flight' rebound."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In Somatic Resonance (L3), chronic tightness in the suboccipital muscles (base of the skull) is frequently mapped to which energetic imbalance?",

                "Over-active Root Chakra",
                "Suppressed Sacral creativity",

                "Digestive stagnation in the Solar Plexus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The suboccipital region often holds the tension of 'trying to figure it all out,' representing a disconnect between mental processing and intuitive somatic reception."

            "id": "q15_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Golden Weave is an advanced cohesion technique used to stabilize and seal the emotional body's perimeter, preventing 'energy leaks' after trauma."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Universal Life Force Reservoirs.' What is the primary indicator that a practitioner is tapping into these reservoirs rather than using their own 'battery'?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner feels exhausted after the session",
                "The practitioner feels energized and 'buoyant' during and after the session",
                "The client feels a cold sensation throughout the body",
                "The session lasts exactly 60 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True high-frequency rejuvenation involves acting as a conduit; if the practitioner feels buoyant and refreshed, they are successfully channeling universal life force rather than depleting personal reserves."

            "question": "Calibration Mastery (L6) focuses on Nervous System Regulation. A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the lesson showed that biofield calibration can improve Heart Rate Variability (HRV) by an average of:",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in the S.O.U.R.C.E. framework stands for Release and Realign, the core phase where the actual energetic shifts and balancing occur."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brittle or 'crunchy' textures in the thoracic region often signify long-held protective mechanisms around the heart, usually stemming from chronic grief or emotional guarding."
