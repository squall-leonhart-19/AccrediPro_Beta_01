            "question": "During Advanced Energetic Scanning, what does a 'jagged, high-velocity' vibration in the mental body layer typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A state of deep meditative peace",
                "Acute cognitive overwhelm or repetitive thought loops",
                "The integration of a new spiritual insight",
                "A physical deficiency in Vitamin B12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Jagged, high-velocity vibrations in the mental body are the energetic signature of cognitive overwhelm, anxiety, or obsessive thought patterns that disrupt the smooth flow of the biofield."

            "question": "In the context of Multidimensional Clearing, what is the primary difference between 'Surface Stagnancy' and a 'Karmic Imprint'?",
            "options": [
                "Surface stagnancy is always cold, while imprints are always hot",
                "Surface stagnancy is temporary environmental debris; imprints are deep-seated patterns held across multiple timelines",
                "There is no difference; they are two terms for the same phenomenon",
                "Surface stagnancy requires a tuning fork, while imprints require crystals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Surface stagnancy refers to daily energetic 'dust' or temporary emotional residue, whereas Karmic Imprints are structural distortions in the causal body that persist until the underlying lesson is integrated."

                "Separating the layers so they do not touch",
                "Synchronizing the rotational velocity of all major chakras with the toroidal field",

                "Stopping the flow of energy entirely to reach 'Zero Point'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cohesion is achieved when the individual components of the biofield (chakras, meridians, layers) are synchronized with the overarching toroidal flow, creating a unified and resilient field."

            "question": "According to the lesson on High-Frequency Rejuvenation, why is the frequency of 528 Hz often utilized in restoration protocols?",
            "options": [
                "It is the frequency of the Earth's magnetic core",
                "It is mathematically linked to the 'Golden Ratio' and biological repair",
                "It is the only frequency that can be heard by the human ear",
                "It prevents the practitioner from getting tired"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "528 Hz is known as the 'Miracle' tone or the frequency of transformation/DNA repair, often used to restore the vital life force due to its resonance with natural biological structures."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Precision Calibration relies on the principle of 'Entrainment.' In a session, this means:",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner's heart rate must match the client's exactly",
                "The client's biofield naturally aligns with the stronger, more stable high-frequency resonance of the practitioner",
                "Both parties must think the same thought at the same time",
                "The practitioner uses heavy pressure to force energy into the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the process where a more powerful or stable vibration (the practitioner's calibrated state) causes a less stable vibration (the client's disharmony) to lock into phase with it."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Golden Rule' of Sustainable Empowerment and energetic hygiene for the practitioner?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compassionate Detachment allows the practitioner to remain a clear channel for healing without taking on the client's energetic 'load' or suffering, ensuring long-term professional sustainability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The S.O.U.R.C.E. framework stands for Scanning, Opening, Unblocking, Resonance, Cohesion, and Empowerment. 'Unblocking' is the phase where stagnancy identified during scanning is removed."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transference occurs when a client redirects feelings for significant people in their life onto the practitioner; managing this is a key component of Professional Sovereignty."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course (n=4,200) found that practitioners who utilized 'Precision Calibration' techniques reported what percentage increase in client-reported session 'depth'?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "25%",

            "explanation": "The study indicated a 47% increase in perceived session depth and efficacy when practitioners consciously calibrated their resonance before and during the session."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with 'leaky' biofield boundaries and frequent energy 'crashes' after work. Which intervention is most appropriate?",

                "Aggressive multidimensional clearing of the root chakra",
                "Implementing the 'Buffer Zone' hygiene protocol and strengthening the outer auric shell",

                "Suggesting the client quit their job immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For leaky boundaries and energy crashes, the priority is strengthening the auric shell and teaching the client hygiene protocols like the 'Buffer Zone' to maintain their own energetic sovereignty."
