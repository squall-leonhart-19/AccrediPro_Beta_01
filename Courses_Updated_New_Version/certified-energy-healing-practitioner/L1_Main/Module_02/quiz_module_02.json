            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "528 Hz is part of the Solfeggio scale and is widely used in energy medicine for its purported ability to facilitate cellular repair and clear deep-seated energetic density."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Astral Layer, or emotional body, is the bridge between the physical and spiritual and is the primary site for emotional alchemy and the clearing of 'astral debris.'"
