            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "Tell the client they are 'unhealable'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professionalism requires recognizing when a pattern is chronic (miasmic) and adjusting the protocol or acknowledging the need for integrated care."
