            "question": "In the S.O.U.R.C.E. Dynamics framework, what is the primary objective of the 'U' (Field Unification) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To remove ancestral blockages from the DNA",
                "To synchronize the vibrational frequencies of all seven auric layers into a single coherent unit",
                "To channel high-frequency restoration energy into the physical body",
                "To set the initial intention for the healing session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Field Unification (U) is specifically focused on 'Auric Phase-Locking,' ensuring that the various layers of the biofield are vibrating in harmony rather than in isolation."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "During Advanced Scanning (S), how is an 'Ancestral Imprint' typically identified compared to a 'Core Imprint'?",
            "options": [
                "Ancestral imprints are only found in the root chakra",
                "Ancestral imprints present as a recurring 'echo' or geometric pattern across the outer layers of the field",
                "Core imprints are always larger in size than ancestral imprints",
                "Ancestral imprints are only detectable through verbal interview"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ancestral imprints often present as persistent, repeating patterns or 'echoes' that resonate through the lineage-linked sections of the auric field, whereas core imprints are specific to the individual soul's current incarnation."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Which layer of the multidimensional field is the primary focus when clearing 'Miasmatic Stagnation' in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "The Etheric Double",
                "The Emotional Body",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Miasmatic stagnation refers to deep-seated, often inherited energetic distortions that reside within the Causal or Karmic layer of the field."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "In the 'Deep Opening' (O) phase, what is the 'Vacuum Effect' and why must it be managed?",
            "options": [
                "A physical sensation of dizziness in the practitioner",
                "The rapid exit of energy that leaves a temporary void, which must be backfilled with high-frequency light",

                "A technical failure in the energetic shield"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When large amounts of stagnant energy are cleared (Deep Opening), it creates an energetic void. If not managed through rejuvenation, the client may feel depleted or re-absorb lower frequencies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5 on High-Frequency Rejuvenation (R), what is the role of the 'Channeled Restoration' technique?",

                "To diagnose new illnesses",
                "To act as a conduit for universal life force to replenish the client’s exhausted reserves",
                "To force the client into a deep sleep",
                "To disconnect the practitioner from the client's field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Channeled Restoration involves the practitioner serving as a bridge for high-frequency energy to fill the spaces cleared during the 'Opening' phase, promoting rapid cellular recovery."

            "options": [
                "Asking the client if they feel better",
                "Using biofeedback, dowsing, or muscle testing to confirm a 'lock' on the new frequency",
                "Waiting 30 days to see if their life changes",
                "Checking the practitioner's own pulse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calibration requires objective verification; tools like dowsing or muscle testing provide immediate feedback on whether the client's energetic system has successfully integrated the new resonance."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah,' who suffered from chronic fatigue linked to a 3rd-generation maternal imprint, which phase of the Deep Dive was most pivotal for her breakthrough?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "For ancestral issues like Sarah's, the Scanning (S) to identify the specific lineage imprint and the Deep Opening (O) to release the generational 'debt' are the most critical steps."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "What is the recommended duration for the 'Integration Window' following a Master Session Deep Dive?",

                "15 minutes",
                "24 to 72 hours",
                "Exactly 7 days",
                "One month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first 24 to 72 hours are critical for 'Empowered Integration,' as the physical and energetic bodies recalibrate to the significant shifts made during the session."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "If a practitioner detects 'Field Fragmentation' during the Unification phase, what is the immediate corrective action?",
            "options": [
                "End the session immediately",
                "Apply 'Auric Smoothing' and use a grounding cord to stabilize the lower three layers",
                "Increase the frequency of the channeled light to its maximum",
                "Ignore it and move to Calibration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Field Fragmentation requires stabilization. Grounding the lower layers and smoothing the auric boundaries ensures the client remains 'held' within their energetic structure."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A 2023 practitioner survey (n=450) mentioned in the module found that sessions utilizing the full S.O.U.R.C.E. protocol resulted in what percentage increase in client-reported 'long-term resilience'?",
