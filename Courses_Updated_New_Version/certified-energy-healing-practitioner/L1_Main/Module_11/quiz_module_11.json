            "question": "In the study of Multidimensional Anatomy, which layer of the biofield serves as the 'bridge' between the lower three physical/personality layers and the upper three spiritual layers?",
            "options": [
                "The Etheric Double",
                "The Astral Body (4th Layer)",
                "The Celestial Body",
                "The Ketheric Template"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Astral Body is the fourth layer of the biofield and acts as the transformative bridge, converting higher spiritual frequencies into forms that can be processed by the physical and emotional bodies."

            "question": "According to the Frequency Mapping of emotions (referencing the Hawkins Scale), which emotional state is categorized as the 'pivot point' where energy shifts from contractive/draining to expansive/power-based?",
            "options": [
                "Neutrality (250 Hz)",
                "Courage (200 Hz)",

                "Reason (400 Hz)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Courage (200) is the critical threshold in energetic frequency; below 200, emotions are life-draining (contractive), while at 200 and above, they become life-enhancing (expansive)."

            "question": "While practicing Somatic Resonance, a practitioner feels a 'dense, heavy, and sticky' sensation in their palms while scanning the client's liver area. This feedback most likely indicates:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dense and 'sticky' sensations in somatic resonance are classic indicators of stagnation or accumulated emotional 'sludge,' often associated with the liver's role in processing anger."

            "options": [
                "Cords are always positive; attachments are always negative.",
                "Cords are two-way energetic exchanges; attachments are one-way parasitic structures.",
                "Cords are located in the aura; attachments are located in the chakras.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable in professional practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cords represent a relational link involving a two-way flow of energy, whereas attachments are typically non-relational, one-way drains or 'hooks' from external entities or thought-forms."

            "question": "When clearing a 'Sacred Container' for a session, why is the use of high-frequency sound (like a 4096Hz crystal tuner) considered more efficient than smoke-cleansing for localized stagnant pockets?",
            "options": [
                "Sound travels faster than air molecules.",
                "Sound uses the Law of Entrainment to physically break up crystalline energetic structures.",
                "Sound is the only way to clear Geopathic Stress.",
                "Smoke-cleansing is actually more effective, but sound is used for client comfort."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-frequency sound waves use the Law of Entrainment to vibrate and dissipate dense, stagnant energy pockets that have become 'crystallized' in a physical space."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "You cannot fill a 'leaky bucket.' In depleted clients, you must first identify and seal auric tears or 'leaks' to ensure the client can actually hold the charge you are providing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The S.O.U.R.C.E. acronym stands for Scan, Open, Uncover, Release, Charge, and Establish. 'Release' is the phase where the practitioner facilitates the removal of identified blockages."

                "Expanding the field further to 'dilute' the external energy.",
                "Using the 'Golden Egg' technique to contract and define the boundary to 2-3 feet.",
                "Cutting cords to everyone in the client's immediate neighborhood.",
                "Focusing exclusively on the Root Chakra for grounding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An over-expanded biofield (10+ feet) often leads to hyper-sensitivity and 'empathic overwhelm.' The practitioner should help the client contract their field to a sustainable 2-3 foot 'Golden Egg' boundary."
