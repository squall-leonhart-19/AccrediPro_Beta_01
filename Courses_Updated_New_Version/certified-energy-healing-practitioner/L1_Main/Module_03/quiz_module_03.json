            "question": "During a session, you notice a 'leak' in the client's second auric layer. According to the Unification Protocol, what is the most effective way to 'Unify' this area?",

                "Ignore the leak and focus only on the crown",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using intentional resonance allows the practitioner to provide a stable frequency that helps the fragmented or 'leaking' area of the aura reintegrate into the client's total energetic system."
