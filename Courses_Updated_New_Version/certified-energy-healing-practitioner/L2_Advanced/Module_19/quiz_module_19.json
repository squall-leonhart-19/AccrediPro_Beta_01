            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "What term did the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine officially adopt in 1992 to describe the 'massless' field that surrounds and penetrates the human body?",
            "options": ["The Human Aura", "The Morphic Resonance Field", "The Biofield", "The L-Field"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The NIH adopted the term 'Biofield' in 1992 to provide a scientific framework for studying the energy fields involved in healing."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which quantum physics principle suggests that two particles can remain instantaneously connected even when separated by vast distances, providing a theoretical basis for distant healing?",
            "options": ["Entanglement (Non-locality)", "Wave-Particle Duality", "The Uncertainty Principle", "The Photoelectric Effect"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Quantum entanglement or non-locality describes how particles can influence each other instantaneously regardless of distance, challenging classical Newtonian physics."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In clinical studies regarding pain management, what has been a consistent finding regarding the efficacy of Reiki compared to standard care?",
            "options": ["It is only effective for psychological pain", "It shows a moderate-to-large effect size in reducing acute pain", "It is less effective than physical therapy", "It only works if the patient is under general anesthesia"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have shown that energy healing modalities like Reiki often produce moderate-to-large effect sizes (Cohen's d) in reducing pain scores compared to standard care alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "How do researchers typically design a 'sham' energy healing treatment to control for the placebo effect?",
            "options": ["They use a machine to deliver the energy instead", "They tell the patient they are receiving healing when they are not", "An untrained person mimics the hand positions without intentional focus or 'tuning in'", "They use magnets to simulate the feeling of a healer's hands"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'sham' treatment involves an untrained actor mimicking the physical movements of a healer without the specific mental intention or energetic state required for actual transfer."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which diagnostic tool is used to measure 'biophotons,' the ultra-weak light emissions from living cells that indicate the state of the biofield?",
            "options": ["EEG (Electroencephalogram)", "BPI (Biophoton Imaging)", "SQUID Magnetometer", "HRV (Heart Rate Variability) Monitor"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biophoton Imaging (BPI) captures the low-level light emitted by biological systems, which is used to assess cellular health and energetic coherence."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "According to Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), how does an energetic shift towards relaxation specifically impact the immune system?",
            "options": ["By increasing cortisol production", "By lowering immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels", "By downregulating the inflammatory response and balancing cytokines", "By stopping the production of white blood cells"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PNI research shows that energetic shifts that reduce stress can downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby strengthening the immune response."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "In the Single-Case Experimental Design (SCED) for practitioners, what is the purpose of the 'A' phase in an A-B-A-B model?",
            "options": ["The 'Action' phase where the healing occurs", "The 'Assessment' phase where data is collected without intervention (Baseline)", "The 'Adjustment' phase where the technique is changed", "The 'Aftermath' phase following the completion of the study"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In SCED, the 'A' phase represents the baseline measurement where the practitioner tracks symptoms before any intervention is applied."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is a primary characteristic of the 'Integrative Clinical Model' for the future of energy medicine?",
            "options": ["Replacing all conventional medicine with energy healing", "Keeping energy healing and conventional medicine in separate buildings", "Multi-disciplinary teams where healers and physicians share data and coordinate care", "Focusing exclusively on the spiritual aspects of healing without scientific data"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The integrative model emphasizes collaboration where energy practitioners work alongside medical professionals to provide holistic, patient-centered care."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Research on Therapeutic Touch (TT) conducted by Dr. Dolores Krieger found that the intervention led to significant increases in which physiological marker?",
            "options": ["Blood Glucose", "Hemoglobin levels", "Bone density", "Visual acuity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Krieger's early research demonstrated that Therapeutic Touch could significantly increase hemoglobin levels, suggesting a direct physiological impact on the body's oxygen-carrying capacity."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered 'Gold Standard' evidence in the hierarchy of research used to validate energy medicine?",
            "options": ["Anecdotal testimonials from social media", "Single-case studies with no baseline", "Double-blind, Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Meta-analyses", "Personal journals of the practitioner"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Meta-analyses of those trials are considered the highest level of clinical evidence for establishing the efficacy of an intervention."
