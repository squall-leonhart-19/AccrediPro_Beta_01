            "question": "In the SOURCE methodology, the 'S' (Scanning) phase specifically requires the practitioner to identify 'Energetic Hotspots.' Which of the following best describes an 'Energetic Hotspot'?",
            "options": [
                "A physical injury that has already been diagnosed by a medical doctor",
                "An area of localized temperature change, density, or 'magnetic' repulsion in the biofield",
                "The specific chakra that corresponds to the client's zodiac sign",
                "A point on the body where the client reports feeling the most emotional pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Advanced Scanning, hotspots are detected through the practitioner's sensitivity to changes in the biofield's density, temperature, or resistance, rather than relying solely on client reporting or physical diagnosis."

            "question": "When using Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV) or Bio-Well technology, what is actually being measured to determine the state of the biofield?",
            "options": [
                "The actual movement of chakras in real-time video",
                "The heat signature of the skin surface (thermography)",
                "Electron emission from the fingertips stimulated by a high-intensity electromagnetic field",
                "The sound frequency emitted by the heart's toroidal field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GDV/Bio-Well technology measures the 'electro-photonic glow' or electron emission from the fingertips when stimulated, which is then mapped to various organs and systems based on Korean hand acupuncture meridians."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In Precision Dowsing, what is the primary purpose of establishing a 'Witness' during the assessment process?",
            "options": [
                "To have a third party observe the session for legal protection",
                "To provide a physical link or energetic sample (like a signature or hair) to the client's frequency",
                "To prove to the client that the pendulum is moving on its own",
                "To calibrate the pendulum to the North and South poles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Witness' acts as a frequency representative of the subject, allowing the practitioner to tune into the specific energetic signature of the client, especially useful in distance healing or complex inquiries."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "During Applied Kinesiology (AK) testing, a 'Strong' indicator muscle that suddenly 'goes weak' when a specific statement is made suggests:",
            "options": [
                "The client is physically exhausted and cannot continue",
                "The statement is energetically congruent with the client's subconscious",
                "The statement creates a neurological 'circuit break' due to stress or incongruence",
                "The practitioner is applying too much physical pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In AK, a muscle 'weakening' or 'unlocking' indicates that the stimulus (the statement or substance) is stressful to the nervous system or energetically incongruent with the client's truth."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "According to Somatic Mapping principles, chronic tension or energetic blockages in the 'Lungs' and upper thoracic area are most frequently associated with which 'trapped' emotion?",
            "options": [
                "Suppressed anger and resentment",
                "Unprocessed grief and the inability to 'take in' life",

                "Creative blocks and sexual repression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In intuitive anatomy, the lungs are the primary somatic reservoir for grief. Difficulty breathing or upper back tension often correlates with the 'heavy heart' of unresolved loss."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A practitioner identifies a 'Deficient' (underactive) Solar Plexus (Manipura) during Chakra Profiling. Which clinical presentation is most likely?",
            "options": [
                "Arrogance, controlling behavior, and workaholism",
                "Low self-esteem, passivity, and a 'victim' mentality",
                "Excessive talking and inability to listen",
                "Hyper-sexuality and lack of emotional boundaries"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A deficient Solar Plexus lacks the 'fire' of will and self-identity, leading to passivity and low self-worth, whereas an 'excessive' Solar Plexus leads to control and aggression."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "In Meridian Profiling, the Liver Meridian is known as the 'General.' If this meridian is chronically stagnant, what psychosomatic symptom is the client most likely to display?",
            "options": [
                "Indecisiveness and lack of direction",
                "Extreme fear and phobias",
                "Frequent outbursts of frustration and 'stuck' life planning",
                "Excessive joy followed by deep depression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Liver Meridian governs the smooth flow of Qi and 'planning.' Stagnation here manifests as frustration, irritability, and the feeling of being 'stuck' in life's circumstances."
        },

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "During a Psychosomatic Intake, a client mentions they have 'always felt they had to earn love through achievement.' This is a hallmark of which 'Core Wound'?",
            "options": [
                "The Wound of Abandonment",
                "The Wound of Injustice",
                "The Wound of Rejection",
                "The Wound of Betrayal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Wound of Injustice often manifests as a 'Rigid' persona where the individual feels they must be perfect or high-achieving to be worthy of love or recognition."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "When synthesizing data for a SOURCE Treatment Plan, why is it critical to identify the 'Primary Driver' versus 'Secondary Symptoms'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner can charge more for complex cases",
                "Because clearing secondary symptoms without addressing the driver often leads to 'symptom jumping'",
                "Because the Primary Driver is always located in the Root Chakra",
                "To satisfy insurance coding requirements for energy medicine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing only the symptoms (secondary effects) provides temporary relief. The 'Primary Driver' is the root cause; if left unaddressed, the energy imbalance will simply manifest in a different part of the biofield ('symptom jumping')."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Neurological Disorganization' (Switching) during an AK assessment. What is the standard protocol to 'reset' the system before continuing the test?",
            "options": [
                "Have the client drink a gallon of water immediately",
                "Firmly massage the K-27 points (under the collarbone) while the client touches their navel",
                "End the session and reschedule for a day when the moon is full",
                "Perform a heavy metal detox protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulating the K-27 points (Kidney 27) is a standard 're-centering' technique in Applied Kinesiology to correct 'switching,' where the body's energetic polarities are temporarily reversed or disorganized due to stress."
