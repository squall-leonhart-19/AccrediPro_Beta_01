            "question": "In the context of the S.O.U.R.C.E. Method™, what does 'Mastering Fluidity' specifically require of the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Strict adherence to the chronological order of the six steps without deviation",
                "The ability to move non-linearly between stages based on real-time energetic feedback",
                "Completing the entire protocol within a 30-minute window",
                "Using only physical touch to guide the energy flow"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluidity in the S.O.U.R.C.E. Method™ allows the practitioner to respond to the client's unique energetic shifts, moving back and forth between stages like Scanning and Clearing as new layers emerge."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "Multidimensional Scanning (Lesson 2) goes beyond basic blockages by identifying 'Energetic Echoes.' Where are these echoes typically found?",
            "options": [
                "Only within the physical dense tissues",
                "In the primary chakras only",
                "In the causal and celestial bodies, representing pre-manifestation patterns",
                "In the client's immediate external environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced scanning looks into the higher subtle bodies (causal and celestial) to find patterns that have not yet manifested physically but are influencing the client's vibration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of 'Unification Synergy' during the clearing process?",
            "options": [
                "To isolate each chakra so they do not influence one another",
                "To ensure the cleared space is immediately filled with the practitioner's personal energy",
                "To harmonize the frequency of the cleared area with the client's 'Core Essence' frequency",
                "To prevent the client from feeling any emotions during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unification Synergy ensures that once a blockage is removed, the resulting 'void' is integrated with the client's unique signature frequency to prevent re-attachment of old patterns."

        {
            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "According to the data presented in Lesson 4, intentional calibration of the heart-brain coherence can increase energetic resilience by what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "25%",
                "40%",
                "Over 75% in consistent practitioners",
                "95% after a single session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research cited in the module indicates that practitioners who master intentional calibration see a marked increase (over 75%) in their ability to maintain their own energetic field during complex sessions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "The 'Synthesis Protocol' in Lesson 5 is designed to solve which common issue in energy healing?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Healer-Client Dependency' trap",
                "The inability to charge professional rates",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Synthesis Protocol focuses on empowering the client's energetic autonomy, ensuring they don't become 'addicted' to the practitioner's energy for their sense of well-being."

        {
            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "When conceptualizing a 'Complex Energetic Profile' (Lesson 6), what is the 'Anchor Point'?",
            "options": [
                "The client's physical weight",
                "The primary trauma or belief system that holds multiple secondary blockages in place",
                "The point where the practitioner's hand first touches the client",
                "The client's astrological sun sign"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Anchor Point is the foundational energetic distortion. By addressing this root, the practitioner can trigger a 'domino effect' that clears multiple secondary issues simultaneously."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "What defines a 'Signature Synthesis' for an advanced practitioner (Lesson 7)?",
            "options": [
                "A logo and branding kit for their business",

                "A specific script that must be read to every client",
                "The process of signing a contract with the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Signature Synthesis is the stage of mastery where the practitioner no longer just 'does' the method, but embodies it through their own unique energetic lens and experience."

        {
            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, which of the following is considered a 'Red Flag' requiring immediate referral to a clinical professional?",
            "options": [
                "A client feeling 'tingly' after a session",
                "A client expressing a desire to change their diet",
                "A client presenting with active suicidal ideation or symptoms of clinical psychosis",
                "A client who is skeptical of energy healing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional ethics and scope of practice dictate that energetic practitioners must refer clients to licensed mental health professionals when clinical pathology or safety risks are present."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "During a session, you find a 'Void' in the heart center that feels like a 'black hole' rather than a standard blockage. Based on Lesson 3, what is the best approach?",
            "options": [
                "Forcefully push energy into the void until it feels full",
                "Stop the session immediately",
                "Use 'Unification Synergy' to bridge the gap between the solar plexus and throat to support the heart's recalibration",
                "Tell the client they have no heart energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'void' often requires structural support from neighboring centers (bridging) to allow the area to safely begin holding its own light again without being overwhelmed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "What is the final step of the 'Energetic Autonomy' handover in the Synthesis Protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Scheduling the next 10 sessions",
                "The 'Intentional Detachment' where the practitioner disconnects their field from the client's",
                "Giving the client a physical crystal to carry",
                "A 20-minute discussion about the practitioner's history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intentional Detachment is crucial for both parties; it ensures the client's field stabilizes on its own and the practitioner does not carry the client's energetic 'residue' after the session."
