            "question": "During Multi-Dimensional Intuitive Scanning (L1), a practitioner detects a 'dense oscillation' in the 5th layer (Etheric Template). What does this typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A temporary emotional fluctuation",
                "A blueprint-level distortion that may manifest as physical pathology",
                "A simple environmental attachment",
                "An overactive Root Chakra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Etheric Template (5th layer) holds the blueprint for the physical body; density here suggests a structural energetic distortion that often precedes or mirrors physical illness."

            "question": "In Neural-Energetic De-armoring (L2), which segment is traditionally associated with the 'suppression of the primal scream' and deep-seated vocal expression blocks?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Cervical (neck) segment holds armor related to vocal expression, swallowing, and the suppression of anger or crying (the primal scream)."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "The 'Part-in-Whole' principle in Holographic Field Unification (L3) suggests that:",

                "Healing can only occur if the physical body is touched",
                "Every individual cell contains the energetic frequency of the entire biofield",
                "The practitioner must focus on one chakra at a time to be effective",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Holographic theory posits that the whole is contained in every part, meaning any point in the biofield can be used to access and influence the entire system's information."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "According to the principle of Frequency Alignment (L5), 'Entrainment' occurs when:",
            "options": [
                "Two frequencies cancel each other out completely",
                "A stronger rhythmic vibration causes a weaker one to synchronize with it",
                "The practitioner absorbs the client's negative energy",
                "The client's frequency remains static regardless of the intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is a law of physics where two oscillating systems synchronize; in healing, the practitioner provides a high-coherence frequency that the client's field aligns with."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In Advanced Energetic Hygiene (L6), what is the primary function of the 'Toroidal Shielding' technique?",
            "options": [
                "To create a rigid, impenetrable wall around the practitioner",
                "To facilitate a continuous, self-cleansing loop of energy that repels 'hooking'",
                "To stop all energy exchange between the practitioner and the client",
                "To ground the practitioner into the Earth's core permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Toroidal shielding uses a dynamic, flowing 'donut' shape that keeps energy moving, preventing stagnant attachments while allowing beneficial exchange."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Geopathic stress specifically refers to the distortion of Earth's natural energies/lines (Hartmann, Curry, or underground water) that can negatively impact the biofield."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The S.O.U.R.C.E. acronym stands for Scan, Orient, Unify, Release, Calibrate, and Embody (the grounding of the new frequency into the physical form)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
