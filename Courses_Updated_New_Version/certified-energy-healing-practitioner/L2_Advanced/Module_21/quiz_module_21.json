            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Transformation,' what is the primary risk of conducting 'ad-hoc' sessions rather than a structured treatment plan?",
            "options": [
                "Increased practitioner fatigue due to lack of structure",
                "The 'Ping-Pong' Effect, where the client experiences temporary relief followed by a return to the baseline state",
                "Higher financial costs for the client with fewer sessions",
                "The inability to use crystals or tuning forks during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ad-hoc sessions often address symptoms rather than root causes, leading to the 'Ping-Pong' Effect where the energetic body reverts to its old patterns because the foundational architecture wasn't restructured."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "According to the S.O.U.R.C.E. Method™, why is the 'Stabilize' phase mandatory before any deep 'Release' work?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client has paid for the full package",
                "To increase the practitioner's intuitive hit rate",
                "To build the client's energetic resilience and prevent a 'healing crisis' or nervous system overwhelm",
                "To clear the physical environment of the healing room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Attempting deep release or 'unclogging' on an unstable system can lead to severe energetic or emotional overwhelm; stabilization ensures the biofield can handle the upcoming shifts."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes a 'Keystone Blockage' in diagnostic prioritization?",
            "options": [
                "The smallest blockage found in the outer layers of the aura",
                "A blockage that has been present for less than 24 hours",
                "The primary energetic knot that, once resolved, triggers the spontaneous clearing of secondary blockages",
                "A blockage specifically located in the Root Chakra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Keystone blockages are strategic priorities; clearing them creates a 'domino effect,' making the rest of the treatment plan significantly more efficient."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Level 4 Chronic Depletion' (adrenal fatigue, brittle aura, low vitality). What is the first priority of the Rejuvenation Protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive purging of all negative attachments",
                "High-frequency calibration to 'shock' the system into health",
                "Nurturing the 'Reserve Tank' through gentle containment and energetic sealing",
                "Immediate discharge as they are too depleted for energy work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For chronic depletion, the practitioner must first seal leaks and rebuild the vital force (the 'reserve tank') before any clearing or high-frequency work is attempted."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",

            "options": [
                "Separate the physical body from the astral body completely",
                "Establish coherent communication and 'phase-locking' between different layers of the subtle bodies",
                "Identify the client's past lives",
                "Balance only the solar plexus chakra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unification focuses on coherence; it ensures that the shifts made in the subtle layers are properly integrated and communicated to the physical and emotional layers."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "Frequency Calibration (Lesson 6) relies on the principle of 'Resonant Entrainment.' This is best defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The client forcing their energy to change through willpower",
                "The practitioner's field vibrating at a lower rate than the client",
                "The process where a stronger, more coherent frequency (the target resonance) causes a weaker, chaotic frequency to synchronize with it",
                "Using sound bowls at the exact same volume as the client's voice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonant entrainment allows the client's field to 'catch' and harmonize with the desired higher frequency established during the calibration phase."

                "Performing daily remote clearings for the client indefinitely",
                "Designing a custom, sustainable daily practice that allows the client to maintain their own energetic boundaries",
                "Selling the client more crystals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowerment is about self-sufficiency. The practitioner must provide the client with the tools and protocols to maintain their own field once the professional sessions conclude."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "What is a 'Discharge Trigger' in professional treatment planning?",
            "options": [
                "A negative comment made by the client that ends the session",
                "A pre-defined metric or goal achievement that indicates the client is ready to transition to self-care or maintenance",
                "The moment a practitioner runs out of time",
                "A specific essential oil used at the end of a journey"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical discharge planning requires identifying 'triggers'—specific signs of progress or goal attainment—that signal the client no longer requires intensive professional intervention."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah presents with a 'scattered' biofield, high anxiety, and a history of trauma. She wants immediate 'past life regression.' According to the S.O.U.R.C.E. Method™, what should you do?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with the regression immediately as requested",
                "Refuse to work with her",
                "Prioritize the 'Stabilize' phase to ground her field and regulate her nervous system before attempting deep subconscious work",
                "Skip to the 'Empower' phase so she can fix it herself"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A scattered field and high anxiety indicate a lack of stability. Deep work like regression requires a grounded, stable container to be safe and effective."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "According to documentation ethics (Lesson 8), what is the 'Gold Standard' for tracking energetic progress?",
            "options": [
                "Only recording the practitioner's intuitive feelings",
                "Using a combination of subjective client feedback, objective energetic assessments (e.g., scan results), and progress toward specific SMART goals",
                "Keeping no records to ensure total client privacy",
                "Recording every single word the client says during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Comprehensive documentation combines the practitioner's observations with the client's experience and measurable goals to track the efficacy of the treatment plan over time."
