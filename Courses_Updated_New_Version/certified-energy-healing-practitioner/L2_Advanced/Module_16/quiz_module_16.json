            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "When addressing Ancestral Imprints in Lesson 1, which mechanism explains how trauma can be energetically and biologically passed down without altering the underlying DNA sequence?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic Mutation",
                "Epigenetic Tagging",
                "Spontaneous Evolution",
                "Cytoplasmic Inheritance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic tagging (such as DNA methylation) allows the expression of genes to change based on ancestral environmental stressors and trauma without altering the DNA sequence itself."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Adrenal Restoration (Lesson 2), clinical data suggests that 85% of sufferers exhibit a specific biofield deformity. What is it?",
            "options": [
                "Over-active Crown Chakra expansion",
                "A 'leak' or collapse in the 3rd Chakra (Solar Plexus) boundary",
                "Excessive grounding in the Root Chakra",
                "Hyper-expansion of the Auric field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CFS and adrenal exhaustion are almost universally characterized by a depletion or 'leakage' in the 3rd chakra, representing a loss of personal 'will' and metabolic energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the primary energetic objective when supporting a client with an autoimmune condition?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing total white blood cell count",
                "Suppressing all energetic flow to the affected organ",
                "Restoring 'Biofield Self-Recognition' to distinguish self from non-self",
                "Opening the Heart Chakra to maximum capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autoimmune conditions are energetically viewed as a failure of 'Self-Recognition,' where the biofield attacks its own frequency; restoration requires re-establishing the energetic boundary of 'Self.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Kriyas' (spontaneous movements), intense heat in the spine, and sensory overload. Based on Lesson 4, what is the safest immediate intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging more intense meditation to 'push through'",
                "Using heavy grounding techniques and temporary cessation of upper-chakra work",
                "Activating the Third Eye to gain clarity",
                "Performing a rapid cord-cutting ceremony"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During a Spiritual Emergence or Kundalini awakening, grounding and stabilizing the physical vessel is the priority to prevent 'burnout' or psychological fragmentation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights that pediatric energetics are unique because children are 'biofield sponges.' What is the 'Mirror Entrainment' principle in family dynamics?",
            "options": [
                "Children's chakras rotate in the opposite direction of their parents",
                "Children's biofields naturally synchronize with the dominant frequency of their primary caregiver",
                "Children are immune to the stress of their parents until age 12",
                "Siblings always share a single unified biofield"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror Entrainment refers to how a child's nervous system and biofield synchronize with their parents, meaning the parent often needs treatment for the child to heal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "During End-of-Life transition support (Lesson 6), what is the function of the 'Silver Cord' in the energetic body?",
            "options": [
                "It connects the physical heart to the liver",
                "It is the energetic anchor between the subtle bodies and the physical vessel",
                "It is a temporary cord formed only during surgery",
                "It is the cord that connects a mother to a child"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Silver Cord is the vital link between the physical body and the astral/etheric bodies; its gradual release is a key part of a peaceful transition during death."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Non-Local Healing (Lesson 7) relies on the quantum principle of 'Entanglement.' What does research by institutions like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) suggest about distance?",
            "options": [
                "Healing efficacy drops by 50% for every 100 miles",
                "Non-local healing only works if the practitioner and client are in the same time zone",
                "Intentionality is independent of distance and does not follow the inverse-square law",
                "Distance healing requires a physical 'tether' like a phone call to work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Quantum entanglement suggests that once two systems are linked, they influence each other instantaneously regardless of distance, meaning healing energy does not 'weaken' over space."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, 'Complex Trauma' is associated with 'Biofield Fragmentation.' What is the first step in the practitioner's protocol for these cases?",
            "options": [
                "Deep regression to the moment of trauma",
                "Establishing a 'Containment Field' and felt-sense of safety",
                "Removing all protective energetic shields",
                "Immediate soul retrieval without a consultation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For complex trauma, safety is the prerequisite. A 'Containment Field' must be established to ensure the client does not re-traumatize or dissociate during the session."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study on Adrenal Biofield Restoration (Lesson 2) found that balancing the 'Triple Warmer' meridian alongside the 3rd Chakra resulted in what percentage reduction in reported fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "32%",
                "64%",
                "98%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical case studies in the module indicate that integrating meridian work (Triple Warmer) with chakra work (Solar Plexus) yields a significant 64% improvement in fatigue markers."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "When working with 'Soul Fragments' in trauma recovery (Lesson 8), what does the practitioner look for in the biofield as a sign of successful integration?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden drop in the client's body temperature",
                "A change in the color of the client's eyes",
                "The 'locking in' or smoothing of previously jagged or 'empty' spots in the aura",
                "The client forgetting the trauma entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Successful integration is marked by the 'filling in' of energetic voids and the smoothing of the auric field where fragmentation previously caused turbulence."
