            "question": "In Lesson 1, Stage 4 Energetic Depletion (the 'Collapse Phase') is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Temporary fatigue that resolves with one night of sleep",
                "A total lack of energetic rebound where the biofield fails to hold a charge even after rest",
                "Hyper-activity and inability to slow down the nervous system",
                "Occasional dips in mood related to external stressors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stage 4 Depletion is a state of chronic exhaustion where the client's energetic reserves are so low that standard rest no longer restores the biofield's 'charge' or resilience."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "When applying Trauma-Informed Energetic Care (Lesson 2), what is the primary purpose of 'Titration'?",
            "options": [
                "To clear all chakras simultaneously in a single session",
                "To force the client to relive the trauma for faster clearing",
                "To introduce small, manageable amounts of energetic release to keep the client within their Window of Tolerance",
                "To measure the exact frequency of the client's aura using a pendulum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves working with trauma in small 'doses' to prevent the nervous system from becoming overwhelmed or 'flooded,' ensuring the client stays within a safe processing range."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Which concept from Lesson 3 describes a subconscious benefit a client receives from remaining ill or 'stuck' in a specific energetic pattern?",

                "Primary Obstruction",
                "Secondary Gain",
                "Karmic Debt",
                "Energetic Inertia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Gain refers to the hidden benefits (such as attention, avoidance of responsibility, or safety) that a client's subconscious receives from maintaining a symptom, which can create resistance to healing."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Ancestral Healing, research in epigenetics suggests that energetic and emotional traumas can be passed down through at least how many generations?",
            "options": [
                "2 generations",
                "Up to 7 generations",
                "Only the immediate parents",
                "Exactly 10 generations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Both energetic tradition and modern epigenetic studies suggest that trauma imprints can affect the lineage for up to seven generations, influencing the current client's energetic signature."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, what is defined as the primary goal of 'Energetic Palliation' for terminal clients?",
            "options": [

                "Removing all past-life karma to ensure a better reincarnation",
                "Facilitating comfort, peace, and energetic 'detachment' to support a dignified transition",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Energetic Palliation focuses on the quality of the energetic experience, helping the client find peace, reduce fear, and gently untether the energetic body from the physical body during the transition process."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "For a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP), Lesson 6 recommends 'Filtering' over 'Shielding.' What is the key difference?",
            "options": [
                "Shielding blocks everything; Filtering allows beneficial energy in while keeping over-stimulating energy out",
                "Filtering requires a crystal, while shielding requires a mantra",
                "Shielding is only for practitioners; filtering is only for clients",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Shielding can often lead to isolation or energetic exhaustion from 'holding the wall.' Filtering is a more advanced protocol that trains the biofield to be selective about what it absorbs."

        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Law of Consent' discussed in Lesson 7, why might a non-beneficial attachment return after a clearing?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner was not powerful enough",
                "The attachment is physically attached to the client's DNA",
                "The client has a subconscious 'hook' or agreement that invites the energy back",
                "The clearing was performed during a full moon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent attachments often rely on a 'hook'—a belief, trauma, or secondary gain—that the client still holds. Without addressing the internal resonance, the attachment may return based on the Law of Consent."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In the 12-Week Transformation Case Management model (Lesson 8), what is the focus of Weeks 10-12?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The final phase of a long-term management plan is dedicated to ensuring the client has the tools to maintain their own energetic health and move forward in their own sovereignty."

            "options": [
                "Deepen the energetic work to reach the root cause faster",
                "Stop the energetic work and use 'grounding' techniques to bring them back to the present moment",
                "Leave the room and let them process it alone",
                "Tell them they are resisting the healing and need to focus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation is a sign of 'hypo-arousal' (falling out of the Window of Tolerance). The practitioner must stop the energetic input and use grounding techniques to stabilize the client's nervous system."

                "HSPs have lower levels of mirror neuron activity",
                "HSPs represent approximately 15-20% of the population and process sensory data more deeply",
                "All HSPs are extroverts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 15-20% of the population possesses the HSP trait, characterized by Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS) and increased activity in regions related to empathy and awareness."
