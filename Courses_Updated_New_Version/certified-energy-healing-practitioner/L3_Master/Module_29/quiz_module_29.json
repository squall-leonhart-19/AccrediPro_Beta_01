            "question": "In the transition from 'Protocol' to 'Flow' (L1), what is the primary indicator that a practitioner has reached the Master Conduit state?",
            "options": [
                "The strict adherence to a 12-step sequence without deviation",
                "The ability to move intuitively between techniques as the energy demands",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Master Conduit state is characterized by 'Flow,' where the practitioner moves beyond rigid protocols and allows the energy to dictate the sequence and intensity of the session."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced scanning looks 'Beyond the Biofield' to access holographic information, non-local data, and multi-dimensional imprints that basic scanning often misses."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zero-Point Rejuvenation requires the practitioner to access the infinite field through dynamic stillness, often referred to as the Void or 'No-Thingness,' where all possibilities exist."

                "The physical stretching of the client's limbs during a session",
                "A sudden increase in the practitioner's energy levels",
                "The tendency of the client's energy to snap back to old, familiar patterns",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rubber-banding occurs when a client experiences a breakthrough but quickly regresses to old energetic baselines. Calibration 'locks in' the new frequency to prevent this."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sovereign Empowerment is about the architecture of autonomy—teaching the client how to maintain their own field and source their own energy without external dependency."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SOURCE Protocol stands for Scan, Open, Unify, Rejuvenate, Calibrate, and Empower. Empowerment is the final integrative step."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'too open' or 'vulnerable' several days after a session. Which Master Integration step was likely insufficient?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a client feels vulnerable or ungrounded after a session, the practitioner likely failed to properly Calibrate and 'lock in' the new baseline, leaving the field unstable."

                "An increase in Beta brainwave activity (stress response)",
                "A complete cessation of heart rate variability",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners in a state of Flow typically exhibit high Gamma brainwave activity and significant Heart-Brain coherence, indicating a state of peak integration and non-local awareness."
