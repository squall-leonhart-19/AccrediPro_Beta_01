            "question": "In Advanced Intuitive Scanning, what is the primary mechanism that allows for 'Remote Biofield Perception' regardless of physical distance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners utilize the principle of non-locality, where consciousness interacts with the biofield via quantum entanglement, making physical distance irrelevant to the accuracy of the scan."

                "The Physical-Etheric bridge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transgenerational imprints and karmic patterns are stored within the Causal Body, which acts as the 'blueprint' or morphic field for an individual's incarnational experience."

            "id": "q24_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Rejuvenation Phase is critical for stabilization; it allows the client's nervous system and biofield to integrate the high-frequency transmission without causing a rebound effect or excessive detox symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In 'Precision Calibration,' how is 'Archetypal Alignment' used to resolve chronic energetic blockages?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Archetypal Alignment involves identifying distorted energetic patterns that mirror universal archetypes and recalibrating the bio-resonance to the 'pure' or healthy version of that archetype."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Master Practitioner empowers the client to maintain their own frequency, shifting them from a state of dependency to becoming their own primary source of energetic regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Energetic Signature is the practitioner's 'vibrational fingerprint,' which is defined by their own inner work, ethical alignment, and the frequency they hold during the session."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "In Clinical Integration (Lesson 8), when managing 'Complex Pathologies,' what is the recommended protocol for a client with severe multi-system depletion?",
            "options": [
                "Perform an immediate, high-intensity karmic clearing to remove the root cause",
                "Use 'Bio-field Stabilization' and containment first, before attempting deep clearing",
                "Refer the client to a different practitioner as the case is too complex",
                "Focus only on the physical symptoms and ignore the energetic field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In cases of severe depletion, deep clearing can be traumatic to the system. The Master Practitioner must first stabilize and 'plug the leaks' in the biofield before addressing deeper imprints."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Karmic Loop' where they consistently attract the same abusive personality types. Which Master skill is most effective here?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Karmic loops often involve 'contracts' or deep-seated patterns in the Causal Body. Recalibrating this layer and performing contract revocation addresses the root of the recurring pattern."
