            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Transformation' (L1), what characterizes a 'Threshold Crossing' within a high-level healing program?",
            "options": [
                "The moment a client pays for the premium program",
                "A pivotal shift where the client's self-identity fundamentally re-aligns with their healed state",
                "The completion of the first three sessions of the protocol",
                "A physical sensation of heat or vibration during an energetic clearing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Threshold Crossings are psychological and energetic milestones where the client moves from 'someone seeking healing' to 'someone living the transformation.'"

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "According to the S.O.U.R.C.E. Layering framework (L2), which layer must typically be stabilized first to ensure the client's nervous system can handle deeper energetic shifts?",
            "options": [
                "The Universal Layer (Spiritual connection)",
                "The Cognitive Layer (Mindset and belief systems)",
                "The Somatic Layer (Physical body and nervous system regulation)",
                "The Relational Layer (Social and environmental dynamics)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Somatic layer is the foundation; without nervous system regulation, deeper energetic or cognitive work can lead to a 'healing crisis' or overwhelm."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "When creating a Niche-Specific Healing Protocol (L3), what is the primary purpose of 'The Gap' analysis?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the financial difference between your price and a competitor's price",
                "To measure the distance between a client's current pathology and their desired functional outcome",
                "To determine how many sessions are needed to fill the practitioner's calendar",
                "To find the silence between energetic pulses during a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Niche-specific protocols succeed by identifying the specific 'Gap' between a client's specific pain point and their specific desired outcome, then building a bridge to close it."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "In Progression Modeling (L4), 'The Mid-Program Dip' typically occurs around weeks 4-6. What is the recommended practitioner response to this phase?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the intensity of energetic clearings to push through the resistance",
                "Ending the program early as the client is likely not ready for transformation",
                "Normalizing the resistance as a sign of subconscious reorganization and focusing on integration",
                "Decreasing the price of the program to maintain client motivation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Mid-Program Dip is a natural part of the 'messy middle' of transformation where the ego resists change; practitioners should normalize this and focus on integration."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "Which biometric measurement is cited in L5 as a gold-standard 'Objective' data point for tracking a client's Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) recovery?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV is a scientifically validated metric for measuring the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, indicating a client's resilience to stress."

            "question": "The 'Empower' Phase (L6) focuses on Sustainability. What is the primary shift in the practitioner-client dynamic during this final stage?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner takes more control to ensure the client doesn't relapse",
                "The practitioner moves from 'Guide/Healer' to 'Consultant/Observer' as the client exercises self-regulation",
                "The practitioner introduces new, unrelated healing modalities to keep the client interested",
                "The practitioner stops all communication to test the client's independence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is achieved when the client moves from practitioner-dependence to self-led mastery and autonomous self-regulation."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "In the 'Business Architecture of Premium Programs' (L7), why is 'Transformation-Based Pricing' preferred over 'Hourly Pricing'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to work fewer hours for more money",
                "It simplifies the accounting process for the business",
                "It aligns the client's investment with the perceived value of the outcome rather than the time spent",
                "It is a requirement for insurance reimbursement in most states"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Premium programs are priced based on the economic and emotional value of the result (the transformation) rather than trading units of time for units of currency."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "Regarding Professional Ethics in L3 programs (L8), what is the most appropriate action if a client develops 'Erotic Transference' toward the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore it and continue the energetic work as long as no physical contact occurs",
                "Reciprocate the feelings to deepen the healing bond",
                "Immediately address the boundary, document the occurrence, and refer the client out if the therapeutic container is compromised",
                "Increase the price of the program to create a professional barrier"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transference must be handled with strict professional boundaries; if it interferes with the healing process, referral to another qualified professional is ethically mandatory."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'High-Touch Intervention Outcomes' mentioned in the module found that programs lasting 12+ weeks had what percentage higher retention of results compared to 4-week interventions?",
            "options": [
                "15% higher retention",
                "40% higher retention",
                "65% higher retention",
                "90% higher retention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that longer-term, structured programs (12+ weeks) lead to significantly higher (65%+) retention of results due to the time required for neural and energetic rewiring."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Cadence of Integration' as described in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "The speed at which the practitioner speaks during a session",
                "The intentional space between sessions designed for the client's bio-field to stabilize",
                "The rhythm of the background music used during energy healing",
                "The number of times a client must practice a mantra per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration requires time; the cadence of a program must allow the 'energetic dust to settle' so the client can process and embody the shifts between sessions."
