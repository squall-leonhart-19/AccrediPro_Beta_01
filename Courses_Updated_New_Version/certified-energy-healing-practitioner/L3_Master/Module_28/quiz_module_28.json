            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stanislav Grof's research indicates that those in a spiritual emergence often retain an 'observing ego'—the ability to witness their experience—whereas clinical psychosis often involves a complete loss of insight and reality testing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS) occurs when a practitioner takes on the emotional or energetic 'weight' of the client's trauma, often resulting from empathetic over-resonance or lack of clearing."
