            "options": [
                "Attempting to clear all remaining karmic imprints",
                "Facilitating energetic detachment and providing transition support for the soul",
                "Aggressively boosting the immune system to prolong life",
                "Focusing exclusively on the physical comfort of the body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In palliative care, the practitioner's role shifts from 'healing' the body to supporting a peaceful transition by facilitating the gentle detachment of the energetic body from the physical form."

            "question": "When working with PTSD and Somatic Release (Lesson 2), why is staying within the 'Window of Tolerance' critical?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the client from falling asleep during the session",
                "To ensure the practitioner does not absorb the client's trauma",

                "To speed up the healing process by forcing a cathartic reaction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the zone where a person can process emotions safely. Pushing a trauma survivor beyond this can lead to flooding or dissociation, which is counter-therapeutic."

            "question": "For high-performance athletes, 'Energetic Priming' is most effectively used to:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Energetic priming helps athletes enter 'the zone' or flow state by creating biofield coherence and regulating the autonomic nervous system to manage pre-performance anxiety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children are energetically sensitive to their parents. Treating the caregiver helps stabilize the child's field, as the child often mirrors the parent's energetic state."

            "explanation": "Clinical observations suggest that energy work 24-48 hours around treatment helps manage nausea and fatigue without interfering with the medication's intended cytotoxic effects."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-locality, a principle supported by quantum entanglement, suggests that consciousness and energy can interact regardless of the physical distance between the practitioner and client."

                "To hold the client down to prevent them from hurting themselves",
                "To maintain a calm, grounded presence and hold space for the nervous system to discharge",
                "To ignore the shaking and continue with the standard hand positions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shaking is a natural biological mechanism for discharging stored trauma (the 'freeze' response). The practitioner should provide a safe, grounded container for this process to complete."
