            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In organizations, the hierarchy is determined by the time of entry (seniority) and the functional weight of the position, whereas families are strictly based on birth order."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemically, a symptom is often a 'representative' for someone or something that has been excluded from the family soul, seeking to be seen and integrated."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Health in adoption constellations requires acknowledging that life comes through the biological parents (the source); the adoptive parents provide the care and support (the resource)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While children from a first marriage have priority in time, the current partnership must be prioritized to create the stable container necessary for the new family system to thrive."

                "Because children are too young to understand the concepts",
                "To protect the child from the 'heavy' energy of the field and the burden of systemic entanglements",
                "Because parents are always the ones who need the most therapy",
                "Because children cannot participate in representative roles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working through the parents (proxies) allows the systemic resolution to reach the child without exposing them to the intensity of the field or making them responsible for the family dynamics."

                "The company has too many employees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a predecessor is excluded or treated unfairly, the 'empty space' they leave behind often causes the successor to 'trip' or fail as the system seeks balance for the exclusion."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic financial struggle or the inability to 'keep' money is often a systemic loyalty to ancestors who lost everything, where the descendant unconsciously says, 'I will be poor like you.'"
