            "question": "In the R.O.O.T.S. Method™ synthesis at the Master level, what does 'Systemic Sovereignty' (the S) primarily refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The client's ability to dominate their family members after a session",
                "The facilitator's absolute authority over the Knowing Field",
                "The client's capacity to remain connected to their system while maintaining individual autonomy",
                "The process of legally separating from a toxic family system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic Sovereignty is the goal of master-level work where the client achieves a state of 'belonging with autonomy,' honoring the system without being enmeshed in its trauma."

            "options": [
                "It acts as a cumulative memory that allows current systems to 'tune into' the patterns of past similar systems",
                "It is a biological chemical released by representatives during intense emotional scenes",
                "It is a psychological trick used by facilitators to build rapport",
                "It refers specifically to the physical distance between representatives in the room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Based on Rupert Sheldrake's theory, morphic resonance suggests that the 'Knowing Field' contains a collective memory that informs the movements and feelings within the constellation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master facilitators look for the intersection point where different ancestral traumas (e.g., paternal war trauma and maternal displacement) meet to create a complex symptom in the client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A liminal bridge is a ritualistic transition that helps the client integrate the deep work of the field into their daily life without 'popping' the energetic bubble too quickly."

                "Actively taking sides with the 'victim' against the 'perpetrator'",
                "Remaining in an 'Empty Center' where they are neither for nor against any element in the system",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-dual awareness in the facilitator allows them to hold 'what is' without judgment, which is essential for the systemic inclusion of all elements, including the 'shadow'."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic health requires inclusion. Acknowledging that the 'shadow' belongs to the system is the first step toward resolution, regardless of moral standing."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master-level practitioners understand that systemic integration is a slow process, often requiring 6 months to 2 years for the 'soul-movement' to reach its full conclusion."

                "The facilitator's own family entanglements being triggered by the client's systemic field",
                "The representatives feeling tired after a long session",
                "The facilitator's desire to become friends with the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic countertransference occurs when the facilitator loses their 'Empty Center' because the client's family dynamics mirror their own unresolved systemic issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic mimicry occurs when a descendant 'carries' the physical or emotional symptoms of an ancestor as a form of unconscious loyalty or 'blind love' within the morphic field."

            "question": "Why does Master-level ritual design prioritize 'Minimalist Intervention'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the facilitator doesn't have to work too hard",
                "Because the Knowing Field is fragile and will break if touched",
                "To allow the system's own self-healing intelligence to complete the movement with minimal ego-interference",
                "To make the session shorter and more profitable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery is often found in 'less is more.' Minimalist interventions ensure that the shift comes from the system itself, making it more sustainable and authentic for the client."
