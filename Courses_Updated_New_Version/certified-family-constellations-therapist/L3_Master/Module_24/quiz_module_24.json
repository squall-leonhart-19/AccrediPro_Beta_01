            "question": "In Master-Level Somatic Resonance (L1), what is the primary function of the practitioner's 'Interoceptive Loop'?",
            "options": [
                "To mirror the client's conscious emotions to build rapport",
                "To use the practitioner's own bodily sensations as a diagnostic instrument for the field",
                "To project calm energy into the client to suppress traumatic responses",
                "To visualize the family tree while maintaining a steady heart rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At the master level, somatic resonance involves the practitioner using their own physiological responses—such as sudden tension, temperature changes, or heaviness—as data points to understand the hidden dynamics within the 'Knowing Field'."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "When navigating Collective Entanglements (L2), which approach is most effective for a client whose family was affected by a national-scale historical trauma?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on the client's relationship with their primary caregiver",
                "Asking the client to forgive the historical perpetrators to achieve closure",
                "Acknowledging the 'Greater Soul' and the collective fate of the group involved",
                "Treating the collective trauma as a personal psychological projection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collective entanglements require the facilitator to look beyond the immediate family to the 'Greater Soul' or collective fate, acknowledging the impact of historical events without attempting to 'fix' them through personal psychology."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "In the 'Alchemy of Language' (L3), what is the defining characteristic of a 'Master-Level' healing sentence?",
            "options": [
                "It uses complex psychological terminology to explain the dynamic",
                "It is long and detailed to ensure the client understands the logic",
                "It is a short, factual statement that acknowledges 'what is' without judgment",
                "It focuses on positive affirmations and future goals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master-level healing sentences derive their power from brevity and truth. They are factual acknowledgments of reality (e.g., 'I see your pain') that allow the field to settle, rather than cognitive explanations."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "When facilitating a Structural Constellation (L4), why might a practitioner include an abstract representative for 'The Goal'?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from painful family memories",
                "To see how the client's systemic entanglements prevent them from moving toward their objective",
                "Because structural constellations do not allow for human representatives",
                "To provide a 'happy ending' for the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Structural constellations use abstract elements like 'The Goal' or 'The Obstacle' to reveal how systemic loyalties or 'blind love' might be pulling the client away from their desired life outcomes."

            "id": "q24_5",

                "Watching the clock to ensure the session ends on time",
                "Maintaining awareness of the entire group and the field, rather than just the client's narrative",
                "Using a video camera to record the session for later review",
                "Inviting as many representatives as possible into the circle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Field leadership requires a 'Wide-Angle Focus' where the facilitator remains attuned to the energy of the whole room and the 'Knowing Field', preventing them from becoming 'hypnotized' by the client's personal story."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Mastery (L6), what is the purpose of 'Titration'?",
            "options": [
                "Rapidly exposing the client to the core trauma to achieve a breakthrough",
                "Introducing traumatic material in very small, manageable 'drops' to prevent re-traumatization",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the work and introducing traumatic energy in small amounts (drops) so the client's nervous system can process it without becoming overwhelmed or flooded."

                "A state of intense concentration on the client's words",
                "Total emotional detachment and lack of empathy",
                "A state of 'not-knowing' and 'not-wanting,' free from personal intention or the urge to 'help'",
                "A meditative state where the facilitator ignores the representatives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Empty Center' is a master-level stance where the facilitator lets go of their own ego, desire to be successful, or urge to 'save' the client, allowing the movements of the soul to lead the constellation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "During Integration Mastery (L8), why is the client often advised NOT to discuss the constellation for several days?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent them from asking for a refund",
                "To keep the details of the session confidential from others",
                "To prevent the 'soul image' from being dissipated by the cognitive mind",
                "Because the facilitator needs time to write the session report"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Talking about a constellation immediately after the session often moves the experience into the analytical, cognitive mind, which can weaken the deep, symbolic 'soul image' that needs time to settle in the heart and subconscious."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'unexplained' financial failure. In a master-level session, the facilitator notices the client's representative keeps looking at the floor. What is the most likely systemic hypothesis?",
            "options": [
                "The client has a lack of financial education",
                "There is an excluded or 'forgotten' person in the system who is being looked at",
                "The client is simply tired and needs to sit down",
                "The floor represents the client's 'grounding' issues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Family Constellations, representatives looking at the floor almost always indicate they are looking at a dead person who has been excluded, forgotten, or not properly mourned in the family system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "If a facilitator feels a strong urge to cry and 'rescue' a client during a session, which master-level skill should they immediately employ?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional Catharsis: Cry with the client to show support",
                "Pendulation: Move the client to a different representative",
                "Returning to the Empty Center: Recognize the counter-transference and step back into neutrality",
                "Structural Intervention: Add a representative for 'The Rescue'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The urge to 'rescue' is a sign that the facilitator has lost their 'Empty Center' and is caught in a personal entanglement (counter-transference). They must recognize this and return to a neutral, centered stance to remain effective."
