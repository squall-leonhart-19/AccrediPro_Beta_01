            "id": "q25_1",
            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Systemic Supervision' (L1), what is the primary function of the 'Parallel Process'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the supervisor and supervisee use the same representative objects",
                "Recognizing how the client's systemic dynamics are being mirrored in the supervisor-practitioner relationship",
                "A method for training two practitioners simultaneously to save time",
                "The process of the practitioner repeating the exact words of the supervisor during a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel process occurs when the supervisee unconsciously recreates the client's systemic entanglements or relational patterns within the supervisory session, providing a 'live' diagnostic of the field."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "When supervising the 'Reveal Entanglements' (R) phase, a 'Practitioner Blind Spot' is most frequently identified by which behavior?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner speaking too loudly to the representatives",
                "The practitioner consistently excluding a specific family member (e.g., an aborted child or a perpetrator) from the field",
                "The practitioner following the ROOTS protocol too strictly",
                "The practitioner asking the client for too much historical data"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blind spots usually manifest as systemic exclusions where the practitioner's own unresolved history prevents them from seeing or including certain elements in the client's system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "In 'Advanced Phenomenology' (L3), what does the supervisor mentor the practitioner to do during the 'Observe the Field' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Intervene immediately when a representative stops moving",
                "Analyze the client's body language using standard psychological profiles",
                "Maintain a state of 'Empty Center' or 'Not-Knowing' to allow the field's movement to emerge",
                "Focus exclusively on the primary client's reactions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced phenomenology requires the practitioner to set aside hypotheses and intentions, holding a space of 'not-knowing' so the authentic systemic movement can reveal itself."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4, what is a common supervisory 'red flag' during the 'Order the System' (O) phase?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner placing the father to the left of the mother",
                "The practitioner forcing a 'happy' resolution before the systemic exclusion has been acknowledged",
                "Using too many representatives in a single constellation",
                "Allowing the representatives to sit down during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A major error in ordering is 'premature resolution,' where a practitioner tries to force a positive outcome before the underlying systemic truth or exclusion has been fully honored."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 5, how is 'Systemic Counter-transference' distinct from standard psychological counter-transference?",
            "options": [
                "It involves the practitioner's personal dislike of the client",
                "It is purely based on the practitioner's childhood trauma",
                "The practitioner begins to feel the emotions or 'burdens' of a specific ancestor in the client's system",
                "It only occurs when the practitioner is tired or burnt out"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic counter-transference occurs when the practitioner (or supervisor) unconsciously steps into a vacant or 'heavy' place in the client's systemic field, feeling the weight of an excluded ancestor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "When mentoring the 'Transmute Burdens' (T) phase (L6), why does the supervisor emphasize the 'weight' of a healing sentence?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the sentence is long enough to be impressive",
                "To check if the practitioner is using the correct grammatical structure",
                "To ensure the sentence resonates with the systemic truth and isn't just a 'polite' platitude",
                "To make sure the client repeats the sentence at least three times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healing sentences must have 'systemic weight,' meaning they must speak the essential truth of the situation to effectively shift the energy of the entanglement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "In evaluating the 'Settle the Resolution' (S) phase (L7), what is the supervisor looking for regarding 'Integration'?",
            "options": [
                "Whether the practitioner gave the client a detailed 10-page report",
                "Whether the practitioner allowed the client to leave with the 'inner image' without over-analyzing it",
                "Whether the client cried during the final movement",
                "Whether the representatives were all dismissed in alphabetical order"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is most effective when the 'resolving image' is left to work in the client's soul; over-explaining or 'talking it away' can weaken the constellation's impact."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "What is the primary characteristic of the 'Inner Supervisor' as described in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "A strict internal voice that criticizes every mistake the practitioner makes",
                "The ability to memorize every healing sentence in the manual",
                "An internalized systemic compass that allows for real-time self-correction and ethical alignment during a session",
                "A mental checklist of the ROOTS framework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Inner Supervisor is the result of mastery, where the practitioner has internalized the systemic principles so deeply they can observe their own work objectively while facilitating."

        {
            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study on therapist mastery (referenced in L1) suggests that practitioners with regular supervision show what percentage increase in 'Systemic Presence' scores?",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "22%",
                "35%",
                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests a 35% increase in 'Systemic Presence' and 'Field Sensitivity' scores for practitioners who engage in monthly supervision compared to those who work in isolation."

        {
            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A supervisee reports feeling an intense 'rescue' urge toward a client whose mother was a perpetrator. The supervisor identifies this as 'Triadic Entanglement.' What is the recommended intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the practitioner to stop working with that client immediately",
                "Have the practitioner bow to the client's mother (the perpetrator) in their own inner work to restore systemic balance",
                "Advise the practitioner to tell the client how bad the mother was",
                "Increase the fee for the session to create better boundaries"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a practitioner feels a 'rescue' urge, they have lost their neutral place. Bowing to the 'difficult' person in the client's system helps the practitioner return to a place of non-judgment and systemic equality."
