            "options": [
                "To identify which ancestor the client is representing in the crisis",
                "To bring the client's awareness back to the immediate physical environment and the present moment",
                "To perform an immediate 'movement of the soul' to resolve the trauma",
                "To organize the family tree and identify missing members"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orienting is a somatic-based stabilization technique used in crisis to help the client transition out of a dissociative or hyper-aroused state by connecting with their current, safe environment."

                "A conscious decision to mimic a parent's career path",
                "An unconscious movement of love where a family member seeks to join a deceased or excluded person in death",
                "A healthy grieving process following the loss of a sibling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'I follow you' dynamic is a deep, unconscious movement of 'blind love' where a descendant attempts to share the fate of a deceased or suffering ancestor by also moving toward death."

                "The victim must immediately forgive the perpetrator to achieve closure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic resolution requires that the perpetrator takes 100% of the responsibility. If the victim 'carries' the guilt or shame, the systemic order remains distorted."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hellinger observed that psychotic symptoms often manifest when a descendant represents both a perpetrator and a victim from the family's past, causing an internal 'fragmentation' or 'war' within the psyche."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In systemic work, addiction (particularly alcoholism) is often seen as a compensatory movement for a 'missing' or rejected father. The 'thirst' for the substance represents the parched soul seeking the father's strength."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the 'heavy' fates of victims or the actions of perpetrators are suppressed or excluded from the family narrative, descendants often 're-live' the trauma somatically until the excluded are acknowledged."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A child is 50% mother and 50% father. Rejecting one parent at the behest of the other causes a 'soul-split' where the child must reject a part of themselves, leading to low self-esteem and depression."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary traumatization (or 'The Heavy Field') occurs when the practitioner absorbs the systemic trauma of the client, manifesting as somatic heaviness, intrusive thoughts, or emotional exhaustion."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic work is a powerful adjunct but not a replacement for clinical crisis intervention. Resilience and ethics require the practitioner to work within a multi-disciplinary framework for high-risk clients."
