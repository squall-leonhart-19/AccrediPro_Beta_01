            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the R.O.O.T.S. Method™, 'Ordering' refers to the pedagogical and energetic process of restoring the systemic 'Orders of Love' as defined by Bert Hellinger, ensuring the curriculum moves from chaos to systemic alignment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The facilitator's internal state, specifically the 'Empty Center' or 'Phenomenological Stance,' is the primary energetic boundary that holds the safety and integrity of the systemic field."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 20/60/20 ratio (Theory/Experiential/Integration) is the gold standard for high-ticket retreats to ensure participants can somatically process the field shifts before returning to their daily lives."

                "To serve as a somatic bridge between the 'Knowing Field' and the participant's daily reality",
                "To act as a representative for the facilitator when the workshop ends",
                "To distract the conscious mind during difficult emotional processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physical anchors serve as 'Systemic Bridges,' allowing the participant to somatically recall the resolution found in the field when they encounter old triggers in their external environment."

                "The phenomenon where representatives feel less emotion through a screen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digital Field Dilution occurs when the domestic environment of a remote participant 'leaks' into the systemic container, requiring stronger opening rituals and stricter 'Sacred Space' protocols."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "A facilitator notices a 'Collective Entanglement' where the entire group starts weeping for a representative. What is the correct 'Advanced Field Management' (L6) response?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In advanced field management, the facilitator must remain outside the 'emotional contagion' of the group and use grounding sentences (e.g., 'I see what happened, and I leave it with those it belongs to') to restore systemic order."

            "id": "q26_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Systemic Shifts are the 'ripple effects' where the field movement impacts family members or elements of the system that were not physically present or even aware of the work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical launching in systemic work requires avoiding 'Systemic Coercion'—the use of a client's fear of 'passing on trauma' to pressure them into a purchase, which violates the 'Orders of Helping.'"

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "During a digital constellation, a representative's screen freezes. According to Lesson 5, what is the protocol for 'Field Continuity'?",
            "options": [
                "The facilitator immediately takes over the role without explanation",
                "The facilitator pauses the field and 're-anchors' the representative's energy using a physical object in the main room",
                "Wait for the person to reconnect, regardless of how long it takes",
                "Cancel the constellation as the field has been broken"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain field continuity in digital work, the facilitator uses 'Energetic Re-anchoring,' often by placing a physical marker in their own space to hold the representative's place until they reconnect."

            "id": "q26_10",

                "The amount of catharsis (crying) expressed by the participants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability (the 'S' in R.O.O.T.S.) is measured by how well the systemic shift integrates into the client's life over time, typically assessed through 90-day follow-ups rather than immediate post-session emotion."
