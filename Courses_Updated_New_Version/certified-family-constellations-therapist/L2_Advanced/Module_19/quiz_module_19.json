            "question": "In the empirical evolution of systemic work, what marked the transition from Bert Hellinger’s early observations to modern evidence-based practice?",
            "options": [
                "The complete rejection of the 'Knowing Field' concept in favor of behavioral science.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern systemic work has evolved by moving from Hellinger's initial anecdotal observations toward rigorous scientific validation through standardized protocols and peer-reviewed research."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which epigenetic mechanism is most frequently cited in research (such as the studies by Rachel Yehuda) as the biological basis for 'revealing entanglements' across generations?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic mutation of the DNA sequence itself.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics focuses on how environmental factors like trauma cause chemical 'marks' (methylation/histone modification) that change how genes are expressed, which can then be passed to offspring."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Mirror Neuron System is the primary neurobiological candidate for explaining empathy and the 'Knowing Field,' as it allows humans to internalize and 'map' the states of others."

            "question": "A landmark Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) by Weinhold et al. (2013) found that participants in Family Constellations showed significant improvement in psychological functioning. What was a key finding regarding the longevity of these results?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Weinhold study was significant because it demonstrated that the psychological benefits of a single Constellation intervention were sustained over a long-term period (12 months)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FAST tool measures how individuals perceive the 'Cohesion' (closeness) and 'Hierarchy' (influence/power) within their family system, aligning with the 'Orders of Love'."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While CBT focuses on conscious thought patterns, Constellations are noted for reaching 'systemic' entanglements and loyalties that often reside in the unconscious or transgenerational field."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lower baseline cortisol is often a signature of post-traumatic stress or inherited trauma, suggesting the body has 'calibrated' itself to a high-stress ancestral environment."

                "It requires at least 50 sessions to see any measurable change.",
                "It is a 'brief therapy' model that can produce significant shifts in 1–3 sessions.",
                "It is only effective if sessions are held daily for six months.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research highlights the efficiency of Family Constellations as a 'brief therapy' intervention, often showing significant psychological shifts in a very small number of sessions compared to traditional long-term therapy."
