            "question": "In the context of multi-generational trauma (L1), what is the primary mechanism behind 'identification' in the Field?",
            "options": [
                "A conscious desire to mimic a successful ancestor's life path",
                "An unconscious movement where a descendant 'takes on' the fate or feelings of an excluded ancestor",
                "A psychological projection of current stressors onto historical family events",
                "A genetic mutation caused by environmental factors in previous generations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identification occurs when the systemic 'conscience' seeks to include an excluded member by having a later-born member repeat their fate, feelings, or symptoms."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "When working with 'The Pull of the Grave' (L2) following a parent's suicide, which systemic movement is most likely to be observed in a child?",
            "options": [
                "The movement of 'I follow you,' where the child unconsciously seeks to join the deceased in death",
                "The movement of 'Better me than you,' where the child tries to save the parent retrospectively",
                "The movement of 'I stay, and you go,' which is the healthy resolution",
                "The movement of 'I take it for you,' where the child carries the parent's depression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'I follow you' movement is the classic systemic response to a parent's suicide, driven by a child's 'blind love' and a desire to remain connected to the parent even in death."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In cases of incest or severe abuse (L3), what is the most critical violation of the 'Orders of Love'?",
            "options": [
                "The violation of the right to belong",
                "The violation of the balance of giving and taking",
                "The violation of the hierarchy, where the child is forced into an adult/partner role",
                "The violation of the family's social reputation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Abuse/incest fundamentally shatters the hierarchy; the child is treated as an equal or a partner, which destroys the 'Order' where parents give and children receive."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to the principles of Adoption and Foster Care (L4), which system holds the 'primary' energetic rank for the child?",
            "options": [
                "The adoptive family, because they provided the actual care and safety",
                "The foster family, as they represent the 'bridge' between systems",
                "The biological lineage, as life comes through the biological parents regardless of their behavior",
                "Both systems hold equal rank in the Field at all times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Family Constellations, the biological parents are the 'primary' system because they are the source of life. The adoptive parents are the 'secondary' system (the 'giving' parents)."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In Systemic Somatics (L5), a chronic illness is often viewed as a representative. If a client's symptom 'looks' at an excluded grandfather in the Field, what does this suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The grandfather had the same illness",
                "The symptom is acting as a placeholder for the grandfather, demanding he be acknowledged",
                "The client is angry at the grandfather for leaving the family",
                "The illness is a direct result of the grandfather's genetic health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Symptoms often represent excluded persons. If the symptom 'looks' at the grandfather, it is likely standing in for him to ensure he is seen and included in the family soul."

                "The current spouse always takes priority over the former spouse",
                "The first spouse has priority because they were there first, and the second spouse must acknowledge this",
                "The spouse who has children with the partner always takes priority",
                "The first spouse is excluded once the divorce is finalized to allow the new system to thrive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Order of Time' dictates that the first spouse has a certain priority. The second marriage can only succeed if the first marriage is honored and the first spouse is given a place of respect."

                "A 'systemic vacuum' where victims and perpetrators are frozen in an eternal struggle until both are included",
                "The automatic exclusion of perpetrators to protect the victims' descendants",
                "The dissolution of family systems in favor of national identity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collective trauma creates a 'frozen' Field. Resolution requires acknowledging both victims and perpetrators to restore the flow of life to the descendants."

                "Push the client to confront the trauma to break the dissociation",
                "Stop the constellation and tell the client they are not ready for therapy",
                "Slow down, ask the client to feel their feet on the floor, and use grounding techniques",
                "Add more representatives to the Field to increase the emotional pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dissociation is a sign of overwhelm. The therapist must slow down the process and ground the client's nervous system to ensure safety and integration."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis mentioned in the module regarding suicide (L2) found that family members of suicide victims have a significantly higher risk of suicidal ideation. Systemically, this is attributed to:",

                "A lack of religious or spiritual support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While biology plays a role, Family Constellations focuses on the systemic pull where the survivor unconsciously seeks to join the deceased out of a sense of loyalty or 'blind love.'"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The resolution in adoption cases usually involves the adoptive parents honoring the biological parents as the 'source' and acknowledging the child's dual lineage."
