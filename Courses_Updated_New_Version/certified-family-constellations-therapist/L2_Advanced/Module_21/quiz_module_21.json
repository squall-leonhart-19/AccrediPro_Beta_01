            "options": [
                "The client's subjective interpretation of their mother's personality.",
                "Factual data regarding 'Heavy Fate,' such as early deaths, exclusions, or migrations.",
                "The client's current workplace performance reviews.",
                "A detailed history of the client's previous talk-therapy experiences."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In systemic work, factual events (Heavy Fate) are prioritized over psychological interpretations because they reveal the actual structure of the family system and potential points of entanglement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A systemic hypothesis focuses on the 'entanglement'—identifying who the client is unconsciously tied to within the family soul, often manifesting as 'I follow you' or 'I do it for you.'"

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resourcing is the foundation. Without sufficient internal or external resources, a client may become overwhelmed by the heavy energies of the ancestral field."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic hierarchy dictates that the family of origin (those who came before) takes precedence in the 'Orders of Love' for restoring the flow of life to the individual."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Constellations work on a soul level; over-analyzing or discussing the session too soon can 'talk away' the energy of the resolution before it has time to take root."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a trauma-informed technique that prevents re-traumatization by ensuring the client only processes as much 'field energy' as their nervous system can handle at one time."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical documentation requires distinguishing between objective facts (dates, deaths) and the therapist's systemic hypotheses, which are interpretations of the field's movements."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This is a classic 'blind loyalty' entanglement where the child unconsciously limits their own success to remain in solidarity with the parent's failure or loss."
