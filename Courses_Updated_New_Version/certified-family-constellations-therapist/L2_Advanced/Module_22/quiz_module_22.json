            "id": "q22_1",
            "question": "According to Bert Hellinger’s 'First Order of Helping,' what is the primary ethical violation a facilitator commits when they attempt to 'save' a client from their fate?",
            "options": [
                "They are failing to use proper representative perception techniques.",
                "They are overstepping by giving more than they have and more than the client can carry.",
                "They are violating the client's right to confidentiality.",
                "They are ignoring the cultural context of the client's ancestors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The First Order of Helping states that one should only give what one has and only as much as the other can take. Attempting to 'save' a client places the facilitator in a superior, parental role, which weakens the client."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "In the context of Informed Consent (Lesson 2), what unique phenomenon must be disclosed to participants before they agree to act as representatives?",
            "options": [
                "The possibility of permanent personality changes.",
                "The legal requirement to report ancestral crimes to the authorities.",
                "Representative Perception—the experience of feeling emotions or physical sensations that do not belong to them.",
                "The financial costs associated with post-session integration therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical informed consent in Family Constellations requires participants to understand 'Representative Perception,' where they may temporarily experience the feelings or symptoms of the person they are representing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "The concept of the 'Hollow Bamboo' in Lesson 3 refers to which ethical stance regarding facilitator authority?",
            "options": [
                "The facilitator should be rigid and unyielding in their interpretations.",
                "The facilitator acts as a clear vessel for the Field, setting aside personal ego and prejudice.",
                "The facilitator should have no training and rely solely on intuition.",
                "The facilitator must always be the loudest voice in the room to maintain order."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Hollow Bamboo' signifies that the facilitator is an instrument of the 'Knowing Field.' Ethically, they must stay 'empty' of personal desires for a specific outcome to allow the systemic truth to emerge."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "During a workshop, a representative begins to show signs of severe hyper-arousal, including shaking and gasping for air. According to Lesson 4 on Participant Safety, what is the facilitator's ethical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Pushing through to find a resolution for the seeker as quickly as possible.",
                "Asking the representative to 'honor the movement' and stay in the feeling.",
                "Pausing the constellation to ground the representative and ensure they are within their window of tolerance.",
                "Ignoring the representative and focusing on the seeker's reaction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Participant safety is paramount. If a representative or seeker moves outside their 'Window of Tolerance' into trauma-flooding, the facilitator must intervene to ground them and prevent re-traumatization."

        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Confidentiality and the Excluded.' How does systemic ethics differ from traditional clinical confidentiality in this context?",
            "options": [
                "Systemic ethics requires that all family secrets be told to the police.",
                "Systemic ethics suggests that the 'right to belong' of an excluded person may supersede the family's desire to keep them a secret.",
                "There is no confidentiality in Family Constellations; everything is public.",
                "Systemic ethics only applies to living family members."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While maintaining session privacy, the facilitator ethically serves the 'whole system.' This means acknowledging those who have been excluded or forgotten, even if the family prefers to keep them 'secret,' to restore systemic balance."

        {
            "id": "q22_6",

                "Inviting the client to speak their native language during the session.",
                "Respecting the client's specific cultural rituals regarding the dead.",
                "Imposing Western psychological frameworks or 'Orders of Love' that contradict the client’s cultural ancestral structures.",
                "Researching the historical context of the client's culture before the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ancestral Imperialism occurs when a facilitator assumes their own cultural or systemic 'rules' (like the Western nuclear family model) are universal and imposes them on clients from different cultural backgrounds."

            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a primary 'Clinical Contraindication' for participating in a Family Constellation (Lesson 7)?",

                "A mild disagreement with a sibling.",
                "Active psychosis or an inability to distinguish between the 'Field' and internal hallucinations.",
                "A desire to improve one's financial situation.",
                "Feeling nervous about speaking in front of a group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients with active psychosis, severe borderline personality disorder, or acute dissociation may lack the 'ego-strength' to safely witness the Field without becoming further fragmented."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, why is the 'Don’t Talk About It' rule often prescribed for the 48-72 hours following a constellation?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the facilitator doesn't get sued for what was said.",
                "Because the session is a secret and should never be shared with anyone.",
                "To prevent the 'leaking' of the energetic resolution through mental analysis or seeking external validation.",
                "Because talking causes immediate physical illness after a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Talking about the session immediately often moves the experience from the 'soul' or 'field' level to the 'intellectual' level, which can dissipate the power of the resolution and stall the integration process."

        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "The 'Third Order of Helping' requires the facilitator to stand as an 'adult before an adult.' What does this ethically prohibit?",

                "Charging a professional fee for the service.",
                "Asking the client about their family history.",
                "Using representatives in the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Third Order of Helping requires the facilitator to respect the client's strength and their fate. Treating the client as a helpless victim (a child) weakens them and violates the systemic order of the relationship."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "If a facilitator realizes mid-session that a client's issue is beyond their professional scope of practice (e.g., severe clinical depression requiring medication), what is the most ethical course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the session but charge double the fee for the extra risk.",
                "Complete the session and then refer the client to a qualified medical or mental health professional.",
                "Tell the client they are 'unfixable' and end the session immediately.",
                "Pretend to be a psychiatrist and offer medical advice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical integrity requires facilitators to know their limits. If a clinical issue arises, the facilitator must ensure the client's safety, complete the immediate systemic work if safe, and provide a referral to an appropriate specialist."
