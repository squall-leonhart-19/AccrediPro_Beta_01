            "question": "In the context of Advanced Somatic Resonance (L1), what is the most critical distinction between 'Empathy' and 'Field Sensing'?",
            "options": [
                "Empathy requires emotional mirroring, while Field Sensing involves detecting sub-threshold physiological shifts in the facilitator's own body.",
                "Empathy is used for individual sessions, while Field Sensing is only used in group workshops.",
                "Field Sensing requires the facilitator to take on the client's symptoms permanently.",
                "There is no distinction; they are two terms for the same neurological process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Field Sensing (Somatic Resonance) goes beyond emotional empathy; it is the facilitator's ability to use their own nervous system as a 'tuning fork' to detect systemic tensions and movements within the Field."

            "question": "When a facilitator identifies a 'Double Displacement' (L2), what is typically occurring in the constellation?",
            "options": [
                "The client is standing in the wrong place in the family hierarchy.",
                "A representative is unconsciously carrying the energy of two distinct systemic figures, such as a victim and a perpetrator.",
                "The facilitator has accidentally used two representatives for the same person.",
                "A representative is displaced from the room due to emotional overwhelm."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Double Displacement occurs when a single representative 'overlaps' two different systemic roles, often creating confusion or a 'split' feeling until the second figure is acknowledged and represented."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Bespoke Healing Sentences (L3), what is the primary reason a 'standard' sentence might fail to produce a shift?",
            "options": [
                "The sentence was not spoken loudly enough.",
                "The sentence lacked 'systemic weight' or failed to resonate with the client's specific somatic 'truth' at that moment.",
                "The client does not believe in the power of words.",
                "Healing sentences are only effective if whispered by the facilitator."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bespoke sentences must match the specific resonance of the Field. If a sentence is too 'light' or doesn't hit the core of the entanglement, it will feel empty and fail to initiate a movement of the soul."

                "The Grandfather who went to war",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Structural constellations use abstract elements like 'The Goal,' 'The Obstacle,' 'The Wisdom,' or 'The Symptom' to represent non-human components of a system."

                "To assign blame to the perpetrator's descendants.",
                "To achieve a 'reconciliation' that includes all excluded parties, including those from historical conflicts.",
                "To ignore historical events and focus only on the client's childhood.",
                "To prove that one culture is superior to another."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working with the Great Soul requires an 'inclusive' gaze that makes room for both victims and perpetrators of collective trauma, acknowledging the systemic weight of historical events on the present."

            "id": "q23_6",

            "options": [
                "To keep the client from moving around the room.",
                "To represent a specific family member or systemic element that the client can physically step onto or interact with.",
                "To mark the exit of the room for safety reasons.",
                "To provide a physical weight for the client to hold."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Floor anchors (felt pieces, papers, or cushions) serve as placeholders for systemic elements, allowing the client to experience the 'representative's perspective' by physically standing on the anchor."

                "The client is literally following their parent to a doctor's appointment.",
                "A systemic identification where the client unconsciously 'takes on' a symptom to stay connected to a deceased or excluded ancestor.",

                "A legal requirement to follow family traditions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'I follow you' dynamic is a common systemic entanglement where a descendant manifests symptoms or illness as a way of 'belonging' to an ancestor who suffered or died prematurely."

            "question": "A 'Master Facilitator' (L8) must avoid the 'Helping Syndrome.' What characterizes this syndrome?",
            "options": [
                "A facilitator who refuses to take payment for sessions.",
                "The facilitator's unconscious need to 'fix' the client, which often stems from their own unresolved family issues.",
                "The facilitator helping the client find a new job.",
                "Providing the client with too many educational resources."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Helping Syndrome occurs when a facilitator's ego or unresolved trauma drives them to 'save' the client, which ultimately disempowers the client and disrupts the systemic order."

            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "During a session on addiction (L7), a facilitator notices the client feels a 'void' behind them. Systemically, this often points toward:",

                "An excluded father or a missing male lineage that hasn't been integrated.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In addiction work, a sense of a 'void' or 'emptiness' behind the client often indicates an excluded parent (frequently the father) whose strength is not reaching the client."

            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Empty Center' state in a Master Facilitator (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "A state of total boredom and lack of interest in the client.",
                "A state of presence where the facilitator is free of personal agendas, judgments, and the desire for a specific outcome.",
                "A state where the facilitator forgets all their training.",
                "The facilitator's ability to clear the center of the room of all furniture."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Empty Center' is a high-level state of phenomenological presence where the facilitator remains open to whatever the Field reveals without imposing their own will or expectations."
