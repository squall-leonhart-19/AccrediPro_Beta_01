            "options": [
                "A cousin who moved to another country for a better job",
                "A grandfather who died in combat at age 22",

                "An aunt who inherited the largest portion of a will"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic weight is determined by the severity of the fate and its impact on the system; early deaths, especially of those who died in service or before they could pass on life, create significant 'weight' in the field."

            "options": [
                "'My father was a very cold and narcissistic man.'",
                "'I feel like I've always been the black sheep of the family.'",

                "'Nobody in my family ever really understood me.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic facts are objective events (births, deaths, exclusions, migrations) that have occurred, whereas narratives are the emotional interpretations or characterizations of those events."

                "To sense 'Primary Somatic Resonance' that mirrors the client's systemic entanglements",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The facilitator uses their own body as a resonant instrument to perceive the 'Knowing Field,' picking up on physical sensations that correspond to the client's family dynamics."

                "To test a specific hypothesis or observe the initial movement between two elements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Mini-constellations are 'surgical' assessments used to test if a specific person is involved in the entanglement or to see the current 'tension' between the client and a specific family member."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Belonging Audit focuses on the First Order of Love: everyone has an equal right to belong. Exclusions (the 'forgotten' ones) are the primary source of systemic entanglements."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ATL measures the cumulative impact of heavy fates. Significant traumas like war, displacement, and multiple early deaths increase the 'load' the current generation may carry."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Floor anchors (like pieces of paper or mats) facilitate a somatic experience, allowing the client to feel the 'field' of that specific position by standing on it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A systemic hypothesis looks for the 'Who' or 'Where' the client is identified with in the family system, usually involving a transgenerational loyalty or entanglement."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client reports that they 'cannot look their mother in the eye' during a mini-constellation. Somatically, the representative for the mother keeps looking at the floor. What does this usually suggest in an assessment?",
            "options": [
                "The mother is looking at a deceased person or an excluded member who is 'below'",
                "The mother is shy and has low confidence",
                "The mother is angry at the client and refuses to acknowledge them",
                "The floor is the most interesting thing in the room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In constellation work, looking at the floor is a classic somatic indicator of looking at the dead or someone who has been 'buried' (forgotten/excluded) in the family soul."
