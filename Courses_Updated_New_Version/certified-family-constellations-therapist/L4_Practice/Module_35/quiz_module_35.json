            "question": "In the evolution from Practitioner to CEO (Lesson 1), what is the primary shift required in the 'Orders of Business' to ensure sustainable scaling?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from working 'on' the business to working 'in' the business exclusively.",
                "Shifting from tactical delivery to strategic field-holding and systems delegation.",
                "Increasing the number of 1-on-1 sessions to maximize hourly revenue.",
                "Eliminating all administrative support to maintain 'soul-led' control."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CEO shift requires the facilitator to move from being the sole operator (tactical) to the leader who manages the strategic vision and delegates operational tasks, allowing the 'business field' to expand without their constant manual input."

            "id": "q35_2",
            "question": "When mastering large-scale group facilitation (Lesson 2) for groups of 50+, which technique is most effective for preventing 'representative fatigue'?",
            "options": [
                "Requiring all participants to stand for the duration of the workshop.",
                "Using 'Inner Constellations' or sub-group work to engage the entire field simultaneously.",
                "Selecting only the most experienced practitioners to represent in every constellation.",
                "Shortening constellations to under 10 minutes regardless of the movement of the soul."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In large groups, keeping the 'Holding Field' active requires engaging the collective. Inner constellations or breaking into sub-groups prevents the majority of the room from becoming passive observers, which leads to fatigue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Digital Expansion, what is the 'Non-Local Field' principle as applied to online facilitation?",
            "options": [
                "The belief that constellations only work if participants are in the same time zone.",
                "The understanding that the morphogenic field is not limited by physical distance or digital interface.",
                "The requirement that all online participants use physical floor anchors in their own rooms.",
                "The technical limitation that prevents ancestral energy from crossing fiber-optic cables."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Non-Local Field' principle asserts that the systemic field is a consciousness-based phenomenon that transcends physical space, allowing for effective representational perception even in a virtual environment."

        {
            "id": "q35_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 defines 'High-Integrity Marketing' for systemic practitioners. Which practice is considered a violation of systemic integrity in advertising?",
            "options": [
                "Sharing anonymized case studies with client permission.",
                "Using 'Pain-Point Agitation' to trigger a client's trauma for the purpose of a sale.",
                "Offering clear pricing and transparent 'Orders of Exchange'.",
                "Marketing based on the facilitator's specific lineage and training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic marketing honors the client's sovereignty. Agitating trauma ('pain-point marketing') creates an entropic bond between the facilitator and client, which violates the principle of 'dignity' and 'safety' in the healing field."
        },

            "id": "q35_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Strategic Partnerships' are viewed through the lens of the 'Orders of Exchange.' What characterizes a 'Systemic Referral Ecosystem'?",
            "options": [
                "A one-way flow of clients where the facilitator never refers back.",
                "A balanced reciprocity where both parties acknowledge the 'Third' (the client's well-being) as the priority.",
                "Paying the highest possible commission to any source regardless of alignment.",
                "Strictly avoiding partnerships with any other health professionals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A systemic ecosystem thrives on balanced exchange. Partnerships are most effective when they are aligned in values and focus on the holistic benefit of the client, maintaining a healthy flow of giving and taking between practitioners."

            "id": "q35_6",
            "question": "When designing High-Ticket Intensives and Retreats (Lesson 6), why is the 'Slow Soul' concept critical for the schedule?",
            "options": [
                "Because long lectures are required to fill the time of a 3-day event.",
                "To allow the deep movements of the soul to integrate without the interference of 'fast' cognitive processing.",
                "To ensure participants have enough time to check their work emails.",
                "Because 'Slow Soul' work requires the facilitator to work fewer hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ancestral and systemic movements often happen slowly. Intensives provide the 'container' for this slow movement to reach completion, which is often interrupted in shorter, 90-minute sessions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q35_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, what is 'Parallel Process' in the context of Master Facilitator Mentorship and Supervision?",
            "options": [
                "When two facilitators work on the same client at the exact same time.",
                "When the facilitator's personal systemic dynamic is mirrored in their relationship with their supervisor.",
                "The process of teaching two different constellation styles simultaneously.",
                "A technical term for facilitating online and in-person groups at once."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel process occurs when the dynamics present in the client-facilitator relationship (or the client's system) are unconsciously replicated in the facilitator-supervisor relationship. Recognizing this is a hallmark of a Master Facilitator."

        {
            "id": "q35_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses Facilitator Longevity. What is the primary cause of 'Systemic Burnout' according to the 'Helper Syndrome'?",
            "options": [
                "Charging too much for sessions.",

                "Using digital tools instead of physical floor anchors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Helper Syndrome' involves the facilitator over-reaching and trying to 'save' the client, which violates the Order of Helping. This leads to exhaustion because the facilitator is trying to carry a weight (the client's fate) that does not belong to them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study on professional scaling in the healing arts (referenced in Lesson 1) found that practitioners who implemented 'Systemic Automation' saw what average increase in client retention?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "12%",
                "34%",
                "85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study indicated a 34% increase in retention, as automation reduced 'friction' for the client and allowed the facilitator to maintain a 'clean' energetic field for the actual healing work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q35_10",
            "question": "Which 'Order of Growth' is most important when expanding a Family Constellations practice globally (Lesson 3)?",
            "options": [
                "Growth must follow the capacity of the facilitator to 'hold' the expanded field.",
                "Growth should be as rapid as possible to dominate the market.",
                "One must always lower prices when entering new global markets.",
                "Global growth is only possible if the facilitator speaks at least five languages."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Systemically, growth cannot outpace the facilitator's 'holding capacity.' If the business grows faster than the facilitator's ability to maintain the field's integrity and safety, the system will eventually collapse or cause 'field fragmentation.'"
