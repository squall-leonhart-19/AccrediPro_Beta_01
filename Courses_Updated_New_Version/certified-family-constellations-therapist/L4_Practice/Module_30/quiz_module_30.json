            "question": "In Lesson 1, the concept of 'Systemic Boundaries' is discussed. Which of the following best describes a boundary violation from a systemic perspective?",
            "options": [
                "Setting a high fee for a signature program",
                "Taking on a client's emotional burden to 'save' them, effectively stepping into a parental role",
                "Limiting sessions to 90 minutes to ensure practitioner energy",
                "Requiring clients to sign a waiver before a group workshop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic boundaries require the practitioner to remain in their 'adult' place. Stepping into a 'rescuer' or parental role (parentification) violates the systemic order and hinders the client's own movement toward resolution."

            "id": "q30_2",
            "question": "According to the Legal Frameworks (L2) lesson, what is the most critical disclaimer to include in a Family Constellations informed consent document?",

                "That the field is guaranteed to provide immediate results",
                "That the practitioner is a licensed medical doctor",
                "That Family Constellations is a sub-modality of traditional CBT",
                "That the work is educational/experiential and not a substitute for clinical mental health treatment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "To manage risk and maintain scope of practice, it is legally vital to clarify that Constellations are experiential/educational and do not replace clinical psychiatry or psychotherapy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": [
                "It allows for the integration of movements that often take weeks or months to fully manifest in the client's life",
                "It is the only way to make a profit in a modern practice",
                "Single sessions are forbidden by the AccrediPro Standards Institute",
                "It prevents the client from seeing other therapists"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Systemic movements often require an 'incubation' period. A signature offer provides the container needed for the client to integrate the shifts occurring in the 'Knowing Field' over time."

        {
            "id": "q30_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modern audiences respond best to language involving epigenetics, nervous system regulation, and somatic experiencing, which provides a grounded framework for the phenomena observed in Constellations."

            "id": "q30_6",
            "question": "During the Intake and Vetting process (L6), which client profile is generally considered a 'red flag' for deep systemic work?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Constellation work can be intense; clients must have sufficient ego-strength and stability (the 'Adult' place) to process the movements. Active psychosis is a primary contraindication."

                "A stable connection and a private space where the client can move or stand if using floor markers",
                "A minimum of 10 participants present on the Zoom call"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For digital practice, the client's physical environment must be private and safe, and they need enough space to engage somatically or use floor markers/anchors."

            "id": "q30_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Scaling, what is the most sustainable way to increase impact without increasing the practitioner's 'Systemic Burden'?",

                "Working 60+ hours a week with 1:1 clients",
                "Transitioning to group workshops or 'Constellation Circles' where the Field does the heavy lifting",
                "Lowering prices to attract more clients",
                "Doing the work for the client so they don't have to feel the pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling through groups allows the practitioner to facilitate the Field for multiple people simultaneously, which is often more sustainable and systemically powerful than back-to-back 1:1 sessions."

        {
            "id": "q30_9",
            "question": "Which ethical principle from Lesson 1 ensures the safety of representatives in a group workshop?",

                "The practitioner choosing roles based on who needs to be 'punished'",
                "Charging representatives more than the 'seeker'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Systemic ethics dictate that representatives must have the autonomy to refuse a role if it feels unsafe or overwhelming, ensuring the workshop remains a space of 'Orders of Love' rather than force."

        {
            "id": "q30_10",
            "question": "When building a global practice (L7), the 'Systemic Currency' refers to:",

                "A digital cryptocurrency for therapists"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In systemic work, the 'balance of giving and taking' is a fundamental order. In a professional context, the fee represents the client's 'take' (the work) being balanced by their 'give' (the payment), which keeps the relationship clean."
