            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Transformation' (L1), what is the primary function of the 'Container Building' phase during the first 90 minutes of a workshop?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately begin the first client constellation to set a high-intensity tone",
                "To establish energetic safety and synchronize the group's autonomic nervous systems",
                "To provide a detailed genealogical lecture on the Orders of Love",
                "To identify which participants are most likely to be 'difficult' during the weekend"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Container building is essential for establishing a 'Holding Field.' By synchronizing the group's nervous systems through grounding exercises, the facilitator ensures the field can support the high-intensity emotional work that follows."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When navigating 'Group Field Dynamics' (L2), what is the 'Parallel Process' phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "When two facilitators disagree on the direction of a constellation",
                "When a representative experiences the exact physical symptoms of the person they are representing",
                "When the group's interpersonal conflicts begin to mirror the systemic entanglements of the client currently 'on the work'",
                "When a participant attends two different workshops simultaneously"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel Process occurs when the 'Knowing Field' expands, causing the group's collective behavior or mood to reflect the specific systemic dynamics being explored in the center of the circle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Art of Representation' (L3), what should a facilitator do if a participant repeatedly refuses to be a representative?",
            "options": [
                "Respect the refusal without judgment, as the 'right' to say no is essential for field integrity",
                "Encourage the group to pressure them so they can 'break through' their resistance",
                "Ask them to leave the workshop as they are not contributing to the collective work",
                "Assign them a 'silent' role where they don't have to move or speak"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Right to Refuse' is a core ethical tenet. Forcing a representative into a role creates 'noise' in the field and violates the sovereignty of the individual, which can compromise the entire constellation's clarity."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "In large group settings (L4), how does the 'Representative Cluster' technique differ from standard representation?",
            "options": [
                "It uses 10 or more people to represent a single ancestor",
                "It involves the facilitator representing everyone simultaneously",
                "It uses small groups of 3-5 people to represent abstract concepts like 'The Forgotten' or 'The Homeland'",
                "It requires the audience to stand up and turn their backs to the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In large groups, Representative Clusters allow the facilitator to address massive systemic weights (like war or migration) by using small groups to represent collective energies rather than just individuals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Collective Transmutation.' What is the specific purpose of a 'Resonance Ritual' at the end of a workshop?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure everyone receives a personal constellation before leaving",
                "To return the 'borrowed' energies of representation back to the field and ground the participants",
                "To collect testimonials for marketing purposes while emotions are high",
                "To determine who will be the client for the next scheduled workshop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resonance Rituals are used to 'de-role' representatives and ensure that the heavy systemic energies encountered during the workshop are consciously released, preventing participants from 'carrying' others' fates home."

        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "During a crisis (L6), a participant begins experiencing 'Secondary Emotions' (dramatic, loud, non-moving crying). What is the most effective facilitator response?",
            "options": [
                "Give them more space to express the emotion fully for as long as they need",
                "Ask the group to surround them and offer physical touch and comfort",
                "Gently but firmly redirect them to the 'Primary Emotion' or ask them to sit down to stop the field leakage",
                "Ignore them completely to avoid giving the behavior 'energy'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary emotions are often a form of resistance that drains the field's power. A facilitator must distinguish these from 'Primary Emotions' (which lead to change) and redirect the energy to maintain the work's focus."

        {
            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "In 'The Business of Constellations' (L7), what is 'Ethical Enrollment' primarily concerned with?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the workshop makes a minimum 40% profit margin",
                "Screening participants to ensure they have the ego-strength to handle systemic revelations",
                "Using high-pressure sales tactics to ensure the 'Knowing Field' is full",
                "Offering discounts to people who bring their entire family"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical enrollment involves 'Vetting for Stability.' Constellation work can be destabilizing; facilitators must ensure participants aren't in an active psychotic break or acute crisis that requires clinical stabilization rather than systemic work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Settling the Resolution.' What is the 'Golden Rule' regarding post-workshop communication about a constellation?",
            "options": [
                "The client should call their family members immediately to tell them what happened",
                "The client should post a detailed summary of the constellation on social media for integration",
                "The client should remain in 'Noble Silence' regarding the constellation for at least 21 days",
                "The client should write a 10-page analysis of the symbols used in the work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Talking about a constellation too soon 'leaks' the soul's energy. 'Noble Silence' allows the new image to take root in the soul without being analyzed or dismantled by the intellect or others' opinions."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study on group interventions (referenced in L2) found that 'Field Cohesion' is highest when the facilitator maintains which stance?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Expert' stance (directing every movement)",
                "The 'Empty Center' stance (multi-directed partiality and presence)",
                "The 'Friend' stance (equalizing power dynamics)",
                "The 'Silent' stance (not speaking at all for the duration)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Empty Center' (or phenomenological stance) allows the facilitator to be present for everyone without taking sides, which maximizes the group's collective resonance and safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "In the case study of 'The Fractured Workshop' (L6), how did the facilitator resolve the 'Group Rebellion'?",
            "options": [
                "By refunding everyone's money and ending the workshop early",
                "By identifying the 'Excluded Element' in the group's own dynamic and acknowledging it",
                "By asserting dominant authority and threatening to expel the ringleader",
                "By switching from Constellations to a different modality like Breathwork"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group resistance is often a 'living constellation.' By treating the group's rebellion as a systemic symptom and acknowledging what was being 'excluded' in the room, the facilitator brings the Orders of Love back into balance."
