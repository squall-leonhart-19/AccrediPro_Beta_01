            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Facilitators operate within a scope of systemic education and resolution. Providing a clinical diagnosis (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder) is a regulated act reserved for licensed mental health professionals."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Duty of Care dictates that client safety supersedes the completion of a constellation. If a client is de-compensating or dissociating, the facilitator must stop and ground the client."
