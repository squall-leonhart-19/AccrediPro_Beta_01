            "id": "q31_1",
            "question": "When defining a 'Systemic Niche' as discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary advantage of identifying a specific 'Entanglement' rather than offering general therapy?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the therapist to charge higher rates for specialized medical equipment.",
                "It creates a 'resonance' with a specific group of clients who share a common ancestral pattern, such as 'The Breadwinner's Burden'.",
                "It guarantees that the therapist will never have to work with complex family dynamics.",
                "It fulfills the legal requirement for systemic facilitators to have a niche."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A systemic niche identifies a specific pattern of entanglement (e.g., recurring financial loss or relationship sabotage), which resonates deeply with clients experiencing those specific ancestral 'echoes'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Orders of Love' applied to business (Lesson 2), why is an extremely low or 'pay-what-you-want' price often counterproductive in systemic work?",
            "options": [
                "It violates the Balance of Giving and Taking, making it difficult for the client to 'take' the solution.",
                "It is illegal under the International Systemic Marketing Act.",
                "It suggests the therapist has not completed their own family constellation.",
                "It causes the 'Field' to become stagnant due to lack of financial flow."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Balance of Giving and Taking is a fundamental Order of Love. If a client doesn't give an appropriate exchange (money), they often feel an unconscious debt that prevents them from fully integrating the healing movement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 describes the 'Bridge Concept' in educational content strategy. What are the three components of a successful systemic bridge?",
            "options": [
                "Problem, Agitation, Solution.",
                "History, Trauma, Forgiveness.",
                "Symptom, Systemic Root, Movement toward Solution.",
                "Introduction, Body, Conclusion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To explain the 'Unseen Field' effectively, content must connect a visible Symptom (e.g., anxiety) to a Systemic Root (e.g., an excluded ancestor) and offer a Movement toward Solution (the constellation process)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Strategic Partnerships' (Lesson 4), what does 'Systemic Cleanliness' refer to when receiving a referral?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the referral fee is paid in cash to avoid taxes.",
                "Maintaining a neutral stance that respects the client's relationship with the referring professional without 'triangulating'.",
                "Requiring the referring professional to attend a constellation first.",
                "Cleaning the physical space where the constellation will take place."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic Cleanliness involves avoiding 'triangulation'—a dynamic where the therapist and client align against the person who referred them (e.g., a doctor or another therapist)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_5",
            "question": "What is the primary psychological objective of a 'High-Impact Intro Workshop' as outlined in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "To teach the entire history of Bert Hellinger's life.",
                "To provide a direct 'somatic taste' of the Knowing Field so participants feel the work's validity.",
                "To recruit at least 50% of the room into a high-ticket masterclass immediately.",
                "To perform a full constellation for every person in the room within 60 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intro workshops are most effective when they move beyond theory and give participants a physical, felt experience of the Field, which bypasses intellectual skepticism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, the 'Virtual Knowing Field' suggests that a therapist's website should primarily function as:",
            "options": [
                "A digital resume listing every certification ever earned.",
                "An energetic container that reflects the facilitator's 'Stance' and presence.",
                "A complex database of genealogical research tools.",
                "A marketplace for selling physical products like crystals and incense."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital presence in systemic work is about 'resonance.' The website acts as an energetic container that signals the facilitator's authority and ability to hold space for the client's system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_7",
            "question": "Why does Lesson 7 advocate for 'Packaging Transformation' (multi-session containers) over single 'one-and-done' sessions?",
            "options": [
                "Single sessions are forbidden by the systemic code of ethics.",
                "It allows the 'image of solution' time to integrate into the client's soul and daily life with support.",
                "It is the only way to ensure the therapist meets their monthly sales quota.",
                "Clients are systemically incapable of changing in a single session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A deep systemic shift (an 'image of solution') often requires time to 'ripen' in the client's life. A package provides the container for integration and follow-up movements."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "What defines 'Systemic Authority' during a conscious sales inquiry call (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": [
                "Dominating the conversation and refusing to let the client speak.",
                "Remaining in the 'Adult' position, observing the client's system without a 'need' to rescue them.",
                "Telling the client exactly which ancestor is causing their problems within the first 5 minutes.",
                "Lowering the price immediately if the client expresses any hesitation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic Authority comes from a place of 'non-attachment' and 'strength.' The facilitator stays in their Adult self, which allows the client to also step into their own Adult self and take responsibility for their healing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study on 'Professional Service Resonance' mentioned in the module found that clients are ___% more likely to commit to a transformation when the provider uses 'Language of the Soul' rather than clinical jargon.",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "32%",
                "64%",
                "88%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that 'Language of the Soul' (words that touch the heart and system) results in a 64% higher commitment rate compared to dry, clinical descriptions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "A client, 'Mark', tells you he wants a constellation but cannot afford your fee. Applying 'Conscious Sales' (Lesson 8), what is the most systemic response?",
            "options": [
                "Offer the session for free because helping people is more important than money.",
                "Tell him he is clearly 'not ready' for healing and hang up.",
                "Hold the boundary of the fee while exploring what Mark *can* exchange, ensuring he remains 'big' in the transaction.",
                "Ask him to borrow money from his parents, as this addresses the ancestral line."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By holding the boundary of value, the therapist respects the client's dignity. Exploring a meaningful exchange (even if adjusted) ensures Mark doesn't become 'small' or 'indebted' to the therapist."
