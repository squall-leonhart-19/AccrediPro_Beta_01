            "question": "According to the work of Rupert Sheldrake discussed in Lesson 1, what is the 'Knowing Field' scientifically categorized as?",
            "options": [
                "A collective hallucination caused by group pressure",
                "A morphogenetic field that stores the 'memory' of the system",
                "A purely psychological projection of the facilitator",
                "A synaptic resonance occurring only in the client's brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance suggests that these fields carry a collective memory and influence the form and behavior of systems."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Representative Perception' is described as the somatic gateway. What biological mechanism is most often cited as the foundation for this resonance?",
            "options": [
                "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS)",
                "The endocrine system's cortisol release",
                "The prefrontal cortex's analytical capability",
                "The vestibular system's sense of balance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Mirror Neuron System allows individuals to 'map' the experiences and intentions of others onto their own nervous system, facilitating representative perception."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "During a constellation, a representative for the 'Father' stands with his back turned to the 'Son.' According to spatial dynamics (Lesson 3), what does this most likely signify?",
            "options": [
                "The Father is protecting the Son from a threat",
                "The Father is looking toward his own unresolved past or ancestors",
                "The Son has achieved independence and no longer needs the Father",
                "The Father is angry and waiting for an apology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Turning one's back in a constellation usually indicates that the person's attention is drawn toward something or someone else in their own history, often an excluded or unresolved trauma."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Bert Hellinger’s concept of the 'Empty Center' (Lesson 4) requires the facilitator to let go of three specific things. Which of the following is NOT one of them?",
            "options": [
                "Fear of the outcome",
                "Intention to 'fix' the client",
                "Professional credentials and training",
                "Preconceived judgments or theories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Empty Center' involves letting go of fear, intention, and judgment (the phenomenological stance), but it does not require discarding one's foundational training."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark of a 'Secondary Movement' as described in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "A slow, irresistible pull toward another representative",
                "Deep, rhythmic breathing and a sense of gravity",
                "Dramatic, loud, or circular emotional expressions that lead to no change",
                "A sudden, quiet realization that brings peace to the field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary movements are often 'noisy' or dramatic but serve as a defense mechanism to avoid the deeper, more painful primary movement of the soul."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, you learned about decoding non-verbal cues. If a representative’s gaze is fixed downward at a specific spot on the floor, what should the facilitator investigate?",
            "options": [
                "The representative is bored and wants to sit down",
                "The representative is feeling superior to the others",
                "There may be an excluded or deceased family member at that spot",
                "The representative is trying to recall a specific childhood memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A fixed gaze on the floor almost always indicates the presence of someone 'below' the ground, usually a dead person who has been forgotten or excluded."

            "id": "q2_7",

            "options": [
                "To give the client time to think of more questions",
                "To allow the superficial movements to settle so the essential movement can arise",
                "To show the client that the facilitator is in control",
                "To wait for the session timer to reach a certain point"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stillness allows the 'noise' of secondary emotions to dissipate, making the genuine, slow movement of the system visible."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A facilitator notices that all representatives are huddled in one corner, leaving a large empty space. In 'Mapping the Field' (Lesson 8), what might this empty space represent?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of interest in the family history",
                "A 'missing piece' or an excluded part of the system's destiny",
                "A technical error in the setup of the constellation",
                "The facilitator's own 'Empty Center'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vast empty spaces or 'voids' in the spatial map often point toward significant exclusions or 'holes' in the family narrative."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A representative reports feeling 'sudden, intense cold' and 'shaking' despite the room being warm. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "A panic attack that requires medical intervention",
                "Somatic resonance reflecting a trauma (e.g., freezing or death) in the field",
                "The representative's personal resistance to the process",
                "A secondary movement intended to gain attention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physical sensations like coldness or shaking are common somatic cues in representative perception, often mirroring the physical state of the person being represented at a moment of trauma."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When tracking movements, a 'Primary Movement' is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "It is fast and impulsive",
                "It is usually accompanied by blame and anger",
                "It is slow, quiet, and leads toward a resolution or 'the truth'",
                "It is repetitive and happens multiple times in a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Primary movements are the deep 'movements of the soul.' They are typically slow, quiet, and carry the weight of essential truth that leads toward healing."
