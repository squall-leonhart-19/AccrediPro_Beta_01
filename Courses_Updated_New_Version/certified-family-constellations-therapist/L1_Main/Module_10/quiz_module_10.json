            "options": [
                "The client's cognitive understanding of the family tree",
                "The therapist's ability to provide emotional comfort",
                "Acknowledging 'what is' without judgment or an intention to change it immediately",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic resolution begins with 'agreeing to what is.' By acknowledging the reality of the system without an agenda, the field is allowed to move toward its own natural resolution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blind love is the unconscious drive to belong by sharing the fate of those who suffered before us, often leading to self-sabotage or chronic patterns."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "The helper must be more powerful than the client",
                "The helper should only intervene when the client is in a state of crisis",
                "The helper meets the client as an adult, respecting their fate and only helping as much as is truly needed",
                "The helper must take on the client's burden to show empathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Third Order of Helping requires the facilitator to stand in their own place and meet the client as an equal adult, without the 'arrogance' of wanting to save them from their fate."

                "A 'Hidden Loyalty' where the client feels it is 'safer' to be poor like the grandfather",

                "The 'Order of Precedence' being ignored"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Financial self-sabotage is frequently a 'hidden loyalty' to a predecessor who suffered loss; the client unconsciously refuses to have more than those who came before."
