            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "In the R.O.O.T.S. Method™, what does the first 'O' (Observe) primarily focus on during a constellation?",
            "options": [
                "Identifying the client's cognitive distortions and negative self-talk.",
                "Decoding spatial dynamics, gaze directions, and physical sensations in the Knowing Field.",
                "Restoring the hierarchy between parents and children through verbal commands.",
                "Assigning homework for the client to complete after the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Observe' phase is dedicated to the phenomenological observation of the 'Field,' looking at where representatives stand, where they look, and the physical sensations they report."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "During the 'Reveal' phase, a client expresses a recurring pattern of financial self-sabotage. If this is a 'Hidden Loyalty,' which systemic sentiment is most likely being expressed?",
            "options": [
                "'I will do it better than you did.'",
                "'I leave you to your own fate.'",
                "'I follow you into poverty (or failure) to belong.'",
                "'I take what you give at the full price.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic loyalties often manifest as 'blind love,' where the individual unconsciously suffers or fails to stay connected to the suffering of ancestors ('I follow you')."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Order' phase of the R.O.O.T.S. Method™, which of the following represents a violation of the 'Hierarchy of Belonging'?",
            "options": [
                "A child feeling responsible for their parent's emotional well-being (parentification).",
                "A younger sibling acknowledging the seniority of an older sibling.",
                "A husband prioritizing his current wife over his mother.",
                "A father providing for his children without expecting emotional repayment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Order of Precedence' dictates that parents give and children take. When a child attempts to 'carry' for a parent, the hierarchy is inverted, causing systemic tension."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "When a representative in a constellation is looking fixedly at the floor, what does this phenomenological sign typically indicate to the facilitator?",
            "options": [
                "The representative is bored and needs to be replaced.",
                "The representative is looking at a dead family member or an excluded ancestor.",
                "The representative is feeling superior to the other members in the system.",
                "The representative is waiting for the facilitator to give them a healing sentence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In spatial dynamics, looking at the floor almost always indicates a connection to someone who has passed away or someone 'cast down' and excluded from the system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In the 'Transmute' phase, what is the primary purpose of 'Healing Sentences'?",
            "options": [
                "To provide positive affirmations that override the client's trauma.",
                "To give the client a script to use when arguing with family members.",
                "To acknowledge 'what is' and give the excluded or burdened a place in the heart.",
                "To apologize on behalf of ancestors for their past crimes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healing sentences are not affirmations; they are 'sentences of reality' that acknowledge systemic truths, which allows the energy in the field to shift from tension to resolution."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "The 'Settle' phase focuses on the 'Restorative Image.' How is this image best utilized by the client post-session?",
            "options": [
                "By frequently analyzing the logic of why the representatives stood where they did.",
                "By looking at a photo of the final constellation every day for a year.",
                "By allowing the final image of peace and order to rest in the soul without over-discussion.",
                "By calling family members to explain the new 'Order' that was established."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration requires the 'Restorative Image' to work on the soul level. Over-talking or analyzing the session (mentalizing) often dissipates the healing energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7 regarding 'Systemic Conscience,' what is the distinction between 'Guilt' and 'Innocence' in a family system?",
            "options": [
                "Innocence is doing what is morally right; Guilt is doing what is morally wrong.",
                "Innocence is the feeling of belonging to the group; Guilt is the fear of being excluded.",
                "Innocence is being the victim; Guilt is being the perpetrator.",
                "Innocence is only possible for children; adults are always in Guilt."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Family Constellations, 'conscience' is a sense organ for belonging. We feel 'innocent' when we follow the rules of our 'tribe' (even if those rules are harmful) and 'guilty' when we deviate from them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "During Case Management (Lesson 8), a facilitator encounters a 'Blocked Field' where no representatives are moving. What is the recommended 'Empty Middle' approach?",
            "options": [
                "Push the representatives physically to stimulate movement.",
                "End the session immediately as the system is not ready.",
                "Wait in stillness, letting go of the desire to 'fix' the client, until the field reveals the next step.",
                "Tell the client a story to fill the silence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Empty Middle' or 'Center' is a state of phenomenological readiness where the facilitator has no intention or fear, allowing the deeper movements of the soul to emerge naturally."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Which specific 'Order of Helping' (Hellinger/ROOTS Ethics) is violated if a therapist feels 'sorry' for a client and tries to protect them from their fate?",
            "options": [
                "The First Order: Giving only what one has.",
                "The Second Order: Respecting the client's fate and systemic circumstances.",
                "The Third Order: Meeting the client as an adult, not a child.",
                "The Fourth Order: Seeing the client as part of a system, not an isolated individual."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Second Order of Helping requires the facilitator to respect the client's destiny. Pity or 'feeling sorry' weakens the client and interferes with their systemic path."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A 2021 study on the efficacy of Family Constellations mentioned in the module found that the method was particularly effective for which outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing IQ and cognitive processing speeds.",
                "Reducing psychological distress and improving overall 'sense of coherence'.",
                "Curing 100% of chronic physical illnesses within three sessions.",
                "Eliminating the need for any other form of medical or psychological intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (such as the Heidelberg studies) indicates that Constellations significantly improve a client's 'sense of coherence' and reduce general psychological distress by resolving systemic entanglements."
