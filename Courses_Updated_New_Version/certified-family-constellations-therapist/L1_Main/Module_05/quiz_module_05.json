            "options": [
                "To provide a logically sound explanation for family trauma",
                "To create a visual and energetic blueprint where everyone is in their rightful place and love flows freely",
                "To force family members who are absent to apologize to the client",
                "To identify which ancestor is responsible for the current system failure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Restorative Image is a soul-level blueprint that visually re-orders the system, allowing the 'Orders of Love' to function correctly."

            "question": "According to the '21-Day Integration Protocol' discussed in Lesson 4, why are clients advised not to discuss their constellation immediately after the session?",
            "options": [
                "Because talking about it dissipates the concentrated soul-energy required for the internal shift",
                "Because the facilitator needs time to file the professional paperwork",
                "Because family members might get angry if they hear what was said",
                "Because the 'Orders of Love' only work if the session remains a secret"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mentalizing and verbalizing the experience too soon moves the energy from the 'soul/feeling' level to the 'intellectual' level, which can weaken the restorative effect."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internalization requires a state of calm and safety (parasympathetic) so the heart-brain can imprint the new restorative image."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Silence protects the 'movement of the soul.' The facilitator must prevent the client from using 'mental chatter' as a defense mechanism against the resolution."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Closing the field is an energetic boundary-setting act that releases representatives from their roles and prevents 'energetic hangovers.'"

            "options": [
                "Tries to force their family to change immediately",
                "Takes an 'active waiting' stance, observing shifts without interfering with the field’s movement",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active waiting allows the systemic ripple effect to manifest naturally without the 'pressure of expectation' which often triggers resistance."

            "options": [
                "They should feel guilty because they are betraying the family",
                "They should stop the therapy until the rest of the family is ready",
                "They should realize that their well-being is the greatest gift they can offer their ancestors",
