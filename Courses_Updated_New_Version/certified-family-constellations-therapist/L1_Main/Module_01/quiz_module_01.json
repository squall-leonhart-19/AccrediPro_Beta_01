            "question": "According to the Foundations of Systemic Consciousness (L1), what is the primary distinction between 'Individual Conscience' and 'Systemic Conscience'?",
            "options": [
                "Individual conscience focuses on personal morality, while systemic conscience ensures the survival and completeness of the whole family group.",
                "Individual conscience is governed by the 'Knowing Field', whereas systemic conscience is purely psychological.",
                "Systemic conscience only applies to living members, while individual conscience applies to the deceased.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms refer to the same internal moral compass used in therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Individual conscience allows us to feel 'good' or 'bad' based on belonging to a group, but the Systemic Conscience is an unconscious force that demands every member of the system be recognized and included, regardless of their personal morality."

            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Ancestral Trauma), a landmark 2015 study by Rachel Yehuda is cited regarding Holocaust survivors. What specific biological marker was found to be altered in their offspring?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated levels of Vitamin D3 synthesis",
                "DNA methylation patterns on the FKBP5 gene, related to stress regulation",

                "Increased neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yehuda's research (2015) demonstrated that the epigenetic effects of trauma, specifically DNA methylation on the FKBP5 gene, could be passed from Holocaust survivors to their children, affecting their stress response systems."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Which dynamic, discussed in Lesson 2, describes the unconscious process where a descendant 'takes on' the fate of an excluded ancestor to ensure they are remembered?",

                "Systemic Displacement",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blind Love, or Identification, is the hallmark of entanglement where a child or descendant unconsciously says, 'I will follow you' or 'I will do it for you,' repeating the difficult fate of an ancestor."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 3 (Exclusion), who is considered to have an 'inalienable right to belong' to the family system?",
            "options": [
                "Only those who have lived ethically and contributed to the family's wealth",
                "Only biological parents and their direct offspring",
                "Everyone, including miscarried children, former partners of parents, and even perpetrators or victims of family members",
                "Only those who are currently living and active in family gatherings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Orders of Love dictate that everyone who has ever been part of the system—including those lost early, former spouses who made room for the current ones, and those who caused or suffered harm—has an equal right to belong."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parentification occurs when the natural hierarchy is inverted, and the child attempts to support or 'save' the parent, becoming the 'Big One' while the parent becomes the 'Little One.' This leads to systemic exhaustion."

            "id": "q1_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In systemic mapping, dashed or broken lines often indicate a cutoff or exclusion, highlighting where the flow of love or acknowledgement has been interrupted by conflict or trauma."

                "A sign of personal weakness or lack of willpower",
                "A random occurrence with no connection to the family history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic therapists view the symptom as a 'solution' the system has found to keep an excluded person or event present. It serves as a pointer to the root entanglement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The systemic intake prioritizes 'hard facts' of fate over 'soft' psychological stories. Early deaths, crimes, or major life shifts are the primary indicators of where entanglements may lie."

            "id": "q1_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic loyalty often manifests as repeating the failures or tragedies of ancestors at the same age or under similar circumstances as a way of 'belonging' to their fate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Sentence of the Soul' is a diagnostic tool used to bring the hidden systemic vow to light, such as 'I will suffer so you don't have to,' which allows the client to see the entanglement clearly."
