            "question": "In the context of Systemic Somatics (Lesson 1), what is the primary function of a physical symptom within a family system?",
            "options": [
                "A biological malfunction unrelated to the family history",
                "A 'placeholder' or mirror for an excluded individual or suppressed event",
                "A punishment for the individual's personal moral failings",
                "A mechanism to ensure the individual remains dependent on the medical system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic Somatics views the body as a mirror; symptoms often represent 'excluded' elements of the system that are seeking acknowledgment through the descendant's biology."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "Lesson 2 discusses 'Ancestral Loyalties.' What does the phrase 'I follow you' typically signify in chronic illness dynamics?",
            "options": [
                "A conscious desire to visit an ancestor's grave",
                "An unconscious movement to share the fate, suffering, or death of a previous family member",
                "A healthy way of honoring a grandparent's professional legacy",
                "A psychological projection of fear onto the future generations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'I follow you' dynamic is a blind loyalty where a descendant unconsciously takes on a similar illness or fate to maintain a bond with a deceased or suffering ancestor."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Orders of Health' (Lesson 3), what is the systemic consequence when a child attempts to 'carry' the emotional burden of a parent?",
            "options": [
                "The parent is successfully healed and the child gains strength",
                "The child gains a higher status in the family hierarchy",
                "The child loses vitality and the parent is not actually relieved of the burden",
                "The family system reaches a new state of equilibrium and health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When children step out of their place to carry for a parent, they violate the Order of Precedence, resulting in a loss of vitality for the child without solving the parent's original issue."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4's deep dive into Cancer and Autoimmune dynamics, what is a frequent systemic 'identification' found in these conditions?",
            "options": [
                "Identification with a perpetrator and a victim simultaneously",
                "A total lack of identification with any family members",
                "An identification only with the most successful family member",
                "A temporary identification with a childhood friend"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Autoimmune conditions and cancer often involve a 'systemic self-attack' where the individual is unconsciously identified with both a victim and a perpetrator within the family history."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 describes addiction as 'Systemic Hunger.' Which parent is most often systemically 'missing' or 'devalued' in the background of addictive behaviors?",

                "The paternal Grandfather"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In many constellation cases, addiction is viewed as a search for the 'missing' or devalued father; the substance serves as a temporary, albeit destructive, substitute for the father's strength."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the case of Anorexia (Lesson 5), what is the common underlying systemic movement toward a parent?",
            "options": [
                "'I will eat for you, Mother'",
                "'I would rather disappear than you, Father/Mother'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anorexia often involves a sacrificial dynamic where the child unconsciously says, 'I would rather disappear (die) than you,' often directed toward a parent who is perceived as wanting to leave or die."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "When 'Transmuting the Somatic Burden' (Lesson 6), why is it critical to avoid 'rejecting' the illness?",
            "options": [
                "Because the illness is the individual's only source of identity",
                "Because rejection is another form of exclusion, which feeds the systemic root of the symptom",
                "Because medical treatments only work if the patient loves their disease",
                "Because the illness is a physical manifestation of the individual's 'True Self'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Since symptoms often represent excluded family members, rejecting the symptom is systemically equivalent to rejecting the person it represents, which prevents resolution."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Lesson 7 explores Psychosomatic Intersections. How did Bert Hellinger often view severe mental health conditions like schizophrenia?",
            "options": [
                "As a purely chemical imbalance with no systemic component",
                "As an identification with an excluded perpetrator and their victim within the system",
                "As a result of modern environmental toxins",
                "As a sign that the individual has a superior spiritual connection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hellinger observed that in cases of psychosis or schizophrenia, the individual is often caught between the opposing forces of a perpetrator and a victim in the family lineage."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "During the 'Integration for Health' phase (Lesson 8), what is a key somatic indicator that a resolution is taking hold?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to breathe rapidly and shallowly",
                "The client experiences a visible 'softening,' deep sighing, or a feeling of weight leaving the shoulders",
                "The client becomes angry at the facilitator",
                "The client's heart rate increases significantly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic resolution is marked by the 'settling' of the nervous system, evidenced by deeper breathing, physical relaxation, and a sense of 'rightness' in the body."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic, unexplained knee pain. In a constellation, they realize they cannot 'bow' to their mother. What is the likely systemic interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The knees are physically weak due to lack of exercise",
                "The pain is a somatic protest against the 'Order of Precedence' (refusing to acknowledge the parent as 'big')",
                "The client is identified with a sibling who was an athlete",
                "The client is manifesting a fear of the future"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Joint pain, particularly in the knees, often relates to the 'humility of the heart' and the difficulty of bowing to one's parents, which is a fundamental requirement for systemic health."
