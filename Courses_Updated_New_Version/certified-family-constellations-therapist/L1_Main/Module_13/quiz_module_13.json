            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "In the context of 'The Architecture of the Knowing Field' (L1), what scientific concept does Rupert Sheldrake propose to explain how information is stored and accessed within a family system?",
            "options": [
                "Morphic Resonance",
                "Epigenetic Imprinting",
                "Quantum Entanglement",
                "Neural Plasticity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Rupert Sheldrake's theory of Morphic Resonance suggests that 'morphic fields' contain a collective memory, allowing information to be transmitted across time and space within a species or system, which aligns with the phenomenological experience of the Knowing Field."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on 'Identifying Systemic Entanglements,' what is the primary driver behind the 'I follow you' dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "A conscious desire for revenge",
                "A biological instinct for survival",
                "Blind, archaic love and a sense of belonging",
                "Cognitive dissonance regarding family history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entanglements like 'I follow you' (into illness or death) are driven by a child's blind, archaic love and the unconscious need to belong to the system by sharing the fate of a previous member."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In the 'Orders of Love' (L3), which principle correctly describes the hierarchy between a first and second marriage?",
            "options": [
                "The second marriage has precedence because it is current.",
                "The first marriage has systemic precedence and must be honored by the second.",
                "There is no hierarchy between partners; they are always equal.",
                "The marriage with more children always takes precedence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemically, those who came first have precedence. The first marriage creates the space for the second; if the first is not honored or acknowledged, the second marriage often faces systemic pressure and instability."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Balance of Giving and Taking' (L4), why might a partner who receives 'too much' from their spouse eventually leave the relationship?",
            "options": [
                "They become bored with the partner's generosity.",
                "The inequality creates a 'debt' so heavy they can no longer face the giver.",
                "They feel they have 'won' the relationship and no longer need it.",
                "Systemic law states that the receiver must always leave first."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In adult partnerships, an extreme imbalance where one gives and the other only takes creates a burden of guilt or debt for the receiver. If they cannot compensate, they often leave to escape the pressure of the obligation."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "During a constellation, a representative suddenly feels a sharp pain in their chest that does not belong to them. According to Lesson 5, this is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Representative Perception is the phenomenon where representatives in a field access the physical and emotional sensations of the person they are representing, demonstrating the somatic intelligence of the Knowing Field."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the healing sentence 'I honor your fate' in the 'Transmute' phase (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "To tell the ancestor they were wrong",
                "To take over the ancestor's suffering",
                "To leave the responsibility and consequences with the rightful owner",
                "To ask the ancestor for financial guidance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Honoring a person's fate acknowledges their dignity and life path while simultaneously disentangling the client from trying to change or carry a burden that does not belong to them."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, 'The Dynamics of the Excluded,' what is the typical systemic consequence when a family member is 'forgotten' or cast out?",
            "options": [
                "The family system becomes more stable and focused.",
                "The excluded person's traits or fate will be 're-presented' by a later member of the system.",
                "The memory of the person is erased from the morphic field forever.",
                "Only the direct children of the excluded person are affected."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The family soul does not tolerate exclusion. If a member is excluded, a later member (often a grandchild or great-grandchild) will unconsciously identify with them and live out their fate to ensure they are 'remembered' by the system."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the 'Settle' phase (L8), what is the therapist's primary recommendation to the client regarding the 'Resolution Image'?",
            "options": [
                "Analyze the image deeply with friends and family immediately.",
                "Try to find logical flaws in the constellation's outcome.",
                "Allow the image to rest in the heart without talking about it for a period of time.",
                "Immediately schedule another constellation to verify the results."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To integrate the resolution, the client is encouraged to 'let it act' on the soul. Talking or analyzing the image too soon can dissipate its energetic power and prevent it from settling into the unconscious."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "In a blended family scenario, a father prioritizes his new wife's needs over the essential needs of his children from a first marriage. Systemically, what is happening here?",
            "options": [
                "He is correctly prioritizing the new social bond.",
                "He is violating the Order of Precedence, as children from the first bond came first.",
                "He is creating a healthy balance of giving and taking.",
                "He is following the 'New Growth' rule which always overrides the past."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the new partnership needs its own space, the father's bond and responsibility to his children from a previous marriage have systemic precedence. Neglecting this order often leads to behavioral issues in children or conflict in the new marriage."

            "id": "q13_10",

                "Maternal Instinct"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bert Hellinger often referred to the child's attempt to suffer for a parent ('Better me than you') as 'Arrogant Love,' because the child unconsciously presumes they have the power to save the parent or change their fate."
