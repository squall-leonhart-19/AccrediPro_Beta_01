            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Art of Observation (O) focuses on reading the 'Knowing Field,' which involves tracking the physiological shifts, gaze, and spatial positioning of representatives to identify where the flow of love is blocked."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Identification with an excluded family member is a classic systemic entanglement, where a later member of the system unconsciously takes on the fate or feelings of an earlier member."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Art of Observation, a downward gaze toward the floor is a significant indicator that the representative is connecting with a deceased family member or an 'excluded' person who is lying in the 'earth' of the family soul."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To restore order, the child must acknowledge their 'smallness' in relation to the parent's 'bigness.' This releases the child from the burden of caretaking and restores the flow of the hierarchy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Settling involves the integration of the 'Restorative Image'—the final, healed configuration of the constellation—which acts as a new internal blueprint for the client's soul."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary loyalty is an expression of 'blind love.' The facilitator must acknowledge this love and help the client transition to 'enlightened love,' where they can honor the ancestor without suffering like them."

                "Forgetting everything the client said in the intake form"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Empty Center' is the facilitator's state of neutrality and openness, allowing them to be guided by the movements of the field rather than their own ego or desire to produce a specific result."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration (Settling) is most powerful when the image is allowed to resonate in the soul's 'depths' without being 'talked away' by the analytical mind, which often triggers resistance."
