            "question": "In the context of 'Systemic Resonance' (Lesson 1), what biological mechanism explains how environmental trauma can affect offspring without altering the DNA sequence itself?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic Mutation",
                "Epigenetic tags such as DNA methylation and histone modification",
                "Mitochondrial DNA depletion",
                "Horizontal gene transfer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics involves chemical 'tags' that turn genes on or off based on environmental stressors, allowing trauma responses to be inherited without changing the underlying genetic code."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "During a Systemic Interview (Lesson 2), a client mentions they feel 'guilty' whenever they experience financial success, noting their grandfather lost everything in a war. This is a primary indicator of:",
            "options": [
                "Personal Conscience",
                "A Hidden Loyalty or 'Blind Love'",
                "A lack of professional ambition",
                "An 'Orders of Love' violation regarding hierarchy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hidden loyalties (Blind Love) occur when a descendant unconsciously limits their own life or success to remain 'loyal' to the suffering or fate of an ancestor."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In Spatial Dynamics (Lesson 3), if a representative in a constellation persistently looks at the floor and refuses to make eye contact with others, what does this typically signify?",
            "options": [
                "The representative is bored or tired",
                "The representative is connecting with an excluded or deceased family member",
                "The client is resisting the healing process",
                "The 'Order of Precedence' has been restored"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Looking at the floor usually indicates that the representative's attention is drawn to someone who is 'in the earth' (deceased) or someone who has been forgotten or excluded from the system."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",

                "Children have precedence over parents because they are the future",
                "The new family (spouse/children) takes precedence over the family of origin",
                "All members are equal, and time of entry into the system does not matter",
                "The family of origin always takes precedence over the new family"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In systemic work, while those who came first (parents) have higher rank in the family of origin, the 'New System' (current marriage/family) takes precedence over the 'Old System' to allow for life to move forward."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "When 'Transmuting the Burden' (Lesson 5), why is it critical that the client returns the burden to the ancestor with 'honor' rather than 'anger'?",

                "Anger is unprofessional in a therapeutic setting",
                "Honoring acknowledges the ancestor's strength and restores the flow of love",

                "Honoring is only required if the ancestor was a 'good' person"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Returning a burden with anger is a form of rejection that keeps the client tied to the fate; honoring acknowledges the ancestor's ability to carry their own fate, which frees the client."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In 'Verbal Alchemy' (Lesson 6), what is the primary characteristic of an effective healing sentence?",

                "It is long and explains the psychology of the situation",
                "It uses 'should' and 'must' to direct the client's behavior",
                "It is a 'Sentence of Reality' that describes 'what is' without judgment",
                "It focuses on forgiving the perpetrator immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healing sentences are most powerful when they are short, direct, and acknowledge the simple, often painful reality of the systemic situation (e.g., 'I see you')."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 emphasizes 'Anchoring the Resolution.' What is the standard recommendation for a client immediately following a powerful constellation?",
            "options": [
                "Discuss the constellation in detail with friends and family",
                "Schedule a follow-up session for the next day to analyze the movements",
                "Allow the 'Restorative Image' to sit in silence without over-analyzing it",
                "Repeat the constellation with different representatives to confirm the result"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Talking too much about a constellation can dissipate the soul-level energy of the restorative image; clients are encouraged to let the image work in silence."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "The 'Therapist's Stance' (Lesson 8) describes the 'Empty Center.' This refers to the practitioner's ability to:",

                "Remain without intention, fear, or preconceived solutions",
                "Focus only on the client's words and ignore the field",
                "Ensure the room is physically empty before the client arrives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Empty Center' is a phenomenological stance where the therapist lets go of the desire to 'fix' or 'help' in a specific way, allowing the field to reveal the necessary movements."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on systemic interventions showed that the most significant factor in long-term resolution was the 'Restorative Image.' This confirms the Lesson 7 concept that:",
            "options": [
                "The client must remember every word spoken",
                "The internal visual shift is more impactful than cognitive understanding",
                "The therapist must be the one to choose the resolution",
                "Constellations only work if the client believes in them"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic work targets the 'soul-image'; the visual and felt sense of a balanced system is what creates the long-term shift in the client's life."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "Rupert Sheldrake's theory of 'Morphic Resonance' (Lesson 1) suggests that the 'Systemic Field' operates as:",
            "options": [
                "A purely psychological projection of the client",
                "A collective memory or 'organizing field' inherent in nature",
                "A religious phenomenon based on faith",
                "A temporary energetic disturbance caused by the representatives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sheldrake's theory posits that systems (from crystals to families) are organized by fields that contain a collective memory, explaining how representatives can 'know' things about a family they've never met."
