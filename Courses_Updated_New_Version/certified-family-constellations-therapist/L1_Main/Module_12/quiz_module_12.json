            "question": "In Advanced Spatial Dynamics, if a representative is placed in the 'Knowing Field' and consistently gazes at a specific spot on the floor, what does this typically indicate to the facilitator?",
            "options": [
                "The representative is losing focus and needs to be replaced.",
                "The representative is looking at a dead or excluded person in the system.",
                "The representative is showing resistance to the process.",
                "The representative is feeling superior to other members of the field."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In constellation work, looking at the floor is a classic spatial indicator of a 'downward gaze,' which signifies a connection to someone who has died or been excluded from the system."

                "The excluded person is automatically reintegrated into the family memory.",
                "The facilitator takes on the emotional burden of the client's family."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Identification occurs when the 'Systemic Conscience' requires a later member to represent someone who was excluded, often leading them to live out that ancestor's suffering or fate."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While the 'older' system has precedence in time, the 'newer' system (current family) has priority for the individual's energy and survival of the new unit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic resonance requires the facilitator to stay in the 'empty center,' using their body as a sensor for the field's dynamics without becoming personally entangled in the symptoms."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This sentence is used to return a burden (fate, guilt, or responsibility) to the person it belongs to, allowing the client to be 'small' and free of that weight."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hellinger famously stated that 'Success has the face of the mother.' If one cannot 'take' their mother as she is, they often struggle to 'take' or sustain success in life."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Helper Syndrome is a boundary violation where the facilitator loses neutrality and tries to manage the client's fate, which weakens the client and the process."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
