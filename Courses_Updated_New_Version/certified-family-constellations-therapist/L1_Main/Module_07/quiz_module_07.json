            "question": "In the context of the 'Interrupted Reaching Out Movement' (IROM), what is the typical adult manifestation of a child who experienced early separation from their mother?",
            "options": [
                "An over-reliance on external validation and career success",
                "A physical or emotional 'paralysis' or withdrawal when approaching intimacy",
                "A tendency to become a 'parentified' child within the family system",
                "An obsessive need to care for the biological mother in her old age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IROM results in a deep-seated fear of reaching out. When the adult client attempts to move toward a partner or a goal, the body remembers the early 'interruption' (pain/rejection), causing them to pull back or freeze."

            "question": "According to the systemic hierarchy in adoption cases, which statement correctly identifies the 'Orders of Love' between biological and adoptive parents?",
            "options": [
                "Adoptive parents take precedence because they provided the daily care and safety.",
                "The biological parents are 'first' as the source of life, while adoptive parents are 'second' in service to that life.",
                "Both sets of parents are equal in the eyes of the system and should be treated as such.",
                "The child must choose one set of parents to belong to in order to avoid systemic 'splitting'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Family Constellations, the biological parents are the 'Big' ones who gave the gift of life. Adoptive parents are the 'Small' ones who support that life. Peace is found when the adoptive parents honor the biological parents as the source."

            "question": "When a physical symptom (such as a chronic illness) appears in a constellation, what is it typically 'looking at'?",
            "options": [
                "A repressed childhood memory that needs to be cognitively processed",
                "A lack of self-care and nutritional deficiencies in the client's current life",
                "An excluded or forgotten member of the family system",
                "A future event that the client is subconsciously afraid of"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Symptoms are often systemic 'messengers.' They represent an excluded person or a heavy fate that has not been acknowledged. The symptom usually 'looks' toward the excluded person until the client also looks there."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client struggles with 'Ancestral Poverty Consciousness' despite having a high-paying job. Systemically, what is the most likely reason for their inability to retain wealth?",
            "options": [
                "A conscious desire to rebel against the capitalist structure of society",
                "An unconscious 'blind loyalty' to ancestors who suffered or died in poverty",
                "A lack of 'giving' in their current relationship causing a financial block",
                "The system is punishing them for a perpetrator's actions in the 3rd generation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Financial blockages are often rooted in a 'loyalty to lack.' If ancestors suffered, the descendant may feel it is 'arrogant' or 'disloyal' to be comfortable or wealthy while they were not."

            "question": "In Lesson 5, how does the 'Shadow of the Excluded' affect the system when a perpetrator (e.g., a murderer or abuser) is judged and cast out?",
            "options": [
                "The system becomes 'cleansed' and the next generation is free from the burden.",
                "The victim's family gains systemic strength while the perpetrator's family loses it.",
                "A later member of the system will unknowingly represent the perpetrator, often repeating their behavior or fate.",
                "The perpetrator is automatically removed from the family soul after three generations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The family soul does not judge; it only seeks completeness. If a perpetrator is excluded, the system will 'force' a later member to identify with them to ensure they are remembered, often through similar destructive patterns."

                "A previous partner or significant love of either spouse who was not honored",
                "The 'idealized' version of the partner that prevents seeing the real person"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Previous significant partners made 'room' for the current relationship. If they are ignored or devalued, the current partner may unknowingly represent them, causing unexplained tension or distance."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Systemic Pedagogy (Lesson 7) suggests that 'difficult' children in schools are often acting out of 'Blind Love.' What does this mean in a classroom setting?",
            "options": [
                "The child is trying to get the teacher's attention to replace a missing father.",
                "The child is following a 'bad' influence from their peer group to feel belonging.",
                "The child's behavior is a signal that someone in their family system is being excluded or forgotten.",
                "The child is mimicking the parents' dislike of the educational system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children are highly sensitive to systemic imbalances. A child's 'bad' behavior is often a functional attempt to bring an excluded family member back into the 'field' of awareness."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Why is 'Post-Session Integration' (Lesson 8) critical, and what is the primary instruction given to the client?",
            "options": [
                "To write down every detail of the session to ensure they don't forget the 'orders'.",
                "To not discuss the constellation with anyone, as talking 'leaks' the soul's energy for change.",
                "To immediately confront the family members who appeared in the constellation.",
                "To schedule a follow-up session within 48 hours to process the emotions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A constellation works on the 'soul' level. Discussing it immediately subjects the profound experience to the 'intellect,' which can dissipate the internal movement and stop the resolution from taking root."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client says, 'I will die in your place' regarding a sick parent. In Constellation theory, this is known as:",

                "The Order of Precedence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a child tries to take on the fate of a parent ('I follow you' or 'I do it for you'), it is called 'Systemic Arrogance.' The child believes they can save the parent, which violates the order that the child is 'Small' and the parent is 'Big'."

        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "In the 'Balance of Giving and Taking' within a couple, how should a partner respond to a 'hurt' or 'wrong' done by the other to maintain the relationship?",
            "options": [
                "By forgiving completely and never mentioning the hurt again.",
                "By doing an equal amount of harm back to ensure total fairness.",
                "By 'paying back' the hurt but with slightly less intensity, out of love.",
                "By leaving the relationship immediately to preserve their own systemic dignity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is the 'Balance in the Negative.' To keep the exchange alive, the hurt must be acknowledged and 'repaid,' but slightly less than what was received. This allows the 'debt' to be settled while keeping the door open for a new positive exchange."
