            "question": "What is the primary distinction between 'Blind Loyalty' and 'Conscious Love' in the context of Family Constellations?",
            "options": [
                "Blind loyalty seeks to suffer or fail to remain 'connected' to an ancestor; Conscious love honors the ancestor by thriving.",
                "Blind loyalty is only present in children under the age of seven.",
                "Conscious love requires the client to break all contact with their biological family.",
                "There is no energetic difference; both are forms of systemic entanglement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Blind loyalty is a primitive form of love where a descendant repeats a tragic fate to feel 'at one' with the family. Transmutation involves moving to conscious love, where the descendant honors the past by living a full, successful life."

            "options": [
                "To feel superior to the ancestor who couldn't handle the burden.",
                "To realize that by carrying the burden, they were actually weakening the ancestor.",
                "To recognize that the burden belongs to the source, and the source has the dignity and strength to carry it.",
                "To demand an apology from the ancestor before returning the weight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core of the Handing-Back Ceremony is restoring dignity to the ancestor by acknowledging that the burden is theirs to carry and that the descendant is not 'bigger' or more capable than the source."

            "id": "q4_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The sentence 'You are the big one, I am the small one' restores the natural hierarchy (The Orders of Love), allowing the child to release the burden of caretaking and receive from the parent instead."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Deep Bow is a somatic ritual of humility. It represents the client bowing to the fate of their ancestors and the greatness of the life force that came through them, without trying to change or judge it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transmutation doesn't erase the past; it changes the client's relationship to it, turning the 'lead' of inherited trauma into the 'gold' of wisdom, resilience, and strength."

            "id": "q4_6",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic guilt is often 'borrowed' or inherited from an ancestor who committed an injustice or suffered one, and was never properly integrated or acknowledged in the family system."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Why are 'Healing Sentences' in Lesson 3 designed to be brief and factual rather than long and emotional?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the session stays within the 60-minute time limit.",
                "To bypass the analytical/defensive mind and speak directly to the 'soul' or systemic field.",
                "Because ancestors cannot process complex modern language.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Short, factual sentences carry more 'weight' in the field. They cut through the stories and justifications of the ego, allowing the systemic truth to land somatically."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elena's resolution came from somatically and linguistically returning the burden of the mother's sorrow, which allowed Elena to stop being the 'mother to her mother' and reclaim her own life."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "What is the purpose of the 'New Image' in the integration phase (Lesson 8)?",
