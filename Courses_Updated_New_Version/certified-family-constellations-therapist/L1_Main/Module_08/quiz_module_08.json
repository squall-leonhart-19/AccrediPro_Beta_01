            "options": [
                "The Personal Conscience, which focuses on individual guilt and innocence.",
                "The Collective Conscience, which ensures no one is excluded from the system.",
                "The Spiritual Conscience, which seeks to transcend physical reality.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Collective (or Systemic) Conscience is the unconscious force that ensures the integrity of the family system by demanding that every member be included and honored."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Observe' phase (the second 'O') is where the practitioner accesses the Knowing Field, watching the representatives' movements without premature interpretation."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "During the 'Reveal' phase, a client identifies that they feel 'small' and 'responsible' for their mother's happiness. This is a classic symptom of which systemic dynamic?",

            "options": [
                "To force the client to forgive their perpetrators.",
                "To ensure the representatives are standing in a perfect geometric circle.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Order' phase focuses on restoring the fundamental laws of the system, such as hierarchy (those who came before have priority) and the right to belong."

                "They transform the 'lead' of heavy systemic burdens into the 'gold' of strength and resolution.",
                "They are designed to confuse the client's ego so the subconscious can take over.",
                "They function as a form of cognitive behavioral reframing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Healing sentences are 'alchemical' because they shift the energetic weight of an entanglement, allowing the client to take the strength of their ancestors rather than their burdens."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "The 'Settle' phase is complete only when the 'Resolution Image' has been anchored. What characterizes a successful Resolution Image?",
            "options": [
                "The client feels a sense of exhaustion and needs to sleep.",
                "Every representative feels 'right' in their place and the client experiences a somatic shift (e.g., deep breath).",
                "The practitioner gives a 20-minute lecture on what the constellation meant.",
                "The client agrees to cut off contact with toxic family members."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethics require representatives to be honest; if they feel nothing, they must report that, as 'emptiness' or 'stillness' is often vital information for the Field."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course suggests that systemic interventions that utilize a 'Resolution Image' (Settle phase) show what percentage increase in client 'sense of peace' compared to talk-therapy alone?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "25%",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The course highlights that the visual and somatic anchoring of the Resolution Image (Settle) significantly outperforms traditional cognitive approaches, with studies showing up to a 68% increase in perceived resolution."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "In a 'Blind Constellation' (Lesson 8), why is it ethically important for the practitioner to withhold the identities of the representatives initially?",
            "options": [
                "To make the session more entertaining for the group.",
                "To prevent the representatives' 'Personal Conscience' and biases from influencing their movements.",
                "To test the psychic abilities of the representatives.",
                "To save time on lengthy introductions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blind constellations prevent representatives from acting out their own 'ideas' or 'biases' about a specific role (like 'mother' or 'perpetrator'), ensuring the movements come strictly from the Field."

            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with chronic 'unearned guilt.' During the Reveal phase, it is found that their grandfather was an oppressor in a war. What is the most likely Transmute sentence to restore order?",
            "options": [
                "'I will pay for your sins, Grandfather.'",
                "'I see what you did, and I judge you for it.'",
                "'I honor you as my Grandfather, and I leave the guilt of your actions with you.'",
                "'I am exactly like you, and I accept your fate.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healing sentences must return the burden to the source while maintaining the bond. 'Leaving the guilt with you' restores the Order of Responsibility."
