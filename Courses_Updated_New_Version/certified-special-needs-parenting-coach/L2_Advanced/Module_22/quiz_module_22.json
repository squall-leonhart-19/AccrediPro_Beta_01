                "Coaches should never share anything with parents to maintain a 'sacred bond' with the child.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L2 emphasizes balancing parental legal rights with the child's right to privacy (UN Convention on the Rights of the Child), focusing on 'functional transparency' rather than total disclosure."
