            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin acts as a biological buffer to the stress response, lowering cortisol levels and promoting the 'tend-and-befriend' response over 'fight-or-flight'."

            "options": [
                "It encourages faster neural pathway development",
                "It reduces sensory sensitivities through exposure therapy",
                "It depletes executive function resources, leading to increased meltdowns or shutdown",
                "It has no measurable impact if the child is highly motivated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environments with high cognitive or sensory load drain the limited executive function 'battery' of neurodivergent individuals, leading to emotional dysregulation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A coach reads a study on a new 'miracle' sensory diet with a sample size of n=4. Why should the coach be cautious about recommending this based on this study alone?",

                "The study likely used a double-blind protocol which is inappropriate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Small sample sizes (n=4) make it impossible to determine if the results were due to the intervention or chance, and the findings cannot be generalized to the broader population."
