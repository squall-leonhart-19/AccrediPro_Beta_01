            "question": "In the 'Architecture of an Evidence-Based Treatment Plan,' what is the primary distinction between a neuro-affirming goal and a traditional compliance-based goal?",
            "options": [
                "Neuro-affirming goals focus on functional autonomy and quality of life rather than suppressing 'atypical' behaviors to appear 'normal'.",
                "Compliance-based goals are only used in clinical settings, while neuro-affirming goals are used in home settings.",
                "Neuro-affirming goals do not require data collection or measurable milestones.",
                "Compliance-based goals focus on the parent's needs, while neuro-affirming goals focus only on the child's sensory needs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming practice prioritizes the child's internal experience and functional independence over the external suppression of neurodivergent traits (like stimming) for the sake of social conformity."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "During the 'Assess & Align' phase (L2), a coach notices a discrepancy between a neuropsychological report and the parents' daily observations. What is the recommended first step?",
            "options": [
                "Disregard the parents' observations as they are likely biased by emotional fatigue.",
                "Follow the clinical report exclusively to ensure the plan remains 'evidence-based'.",
                "Synthesize the data by validating the clinical findings while using parent observations to identify 'real-world' functional gaps.",
                "Refer the family back to the psychologist to have the report rewritten."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced assessment synthesis involves reconciling clinical data with the 'lived experience' of the family to create a plan that is both scientifically sound and practically applicable."

            "id": "q21_3",

            "options": [
                "To act as the legal representative for the family in due process hearings.",
                "To serve as a 'Communication Bridge,' helping parents translate clinical goals into actionable home-based support strategies.",
                "To override the recommendations of school therapists if they conflict with the coaching plan.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches act as coordinators who help parents understand and integrate various professional recommendations into a cohesive, manageable family lifestyle."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When formulating neuro-affirming milestones (L4), which of the following is considered a 'Strength-Based' objective?",
            "options": [
                "The child will reduce hand-flapping by 80% during social interactions.",
                "The child will maintain eye contact for 10 seconds when greeted by an adult.",
                "The child will utilize a noise-canceling headset to increase participation in family mealtimes from 5 to 15 minutes.",
                "The child will stop using a transition object (toy) when entering the classroom."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using a noise-canceling headset is an accommodation that supports participation while respecting the child's sensory profile, which is a hallmark of neuro-affirming goal setting."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Sensory and Emotional Regulation Plan' emphasizes 'Proactive Regulation.' What does this typically involve?",

                "Implementing a 'time-out' immediately after a meltdown occurs.",
                "Scheduled 'Sensory Snacks' throughout the day to keep the nervous system regulated before a state of overwhelm is reached.",
                "Rewarding the child with a treat only when they remain calm in a loud environment.",
                "Removing all sensory stimuli from the child's environment permanently."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proactive regulation (or sensory diets/snacks) involves front-loading sensory input to maintain a regulated state, rather than waiting for dysregulation to occur."

            "options": [
                "Parents of children with ASD report stress levels similar to combat veterans, making plan sustainability a clinical necessity.",
                "90% of treatment plans fail because children refuse to participate.",
                "Treatment plans are 50% more effective if they include at least 10 hours of therapy per week.",
                "Parental burnout only affects families who do not have insurance coverage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Seltzer et al.) indicates that the chronic stress experienced by special needs parents is comparable to combat veterans; therefore, a plan that ignores parent well-being is destined for 'implementation collapse'."

            "question": "When using 'Data-Driven Decision Making' (L7), what is the 'Baseline' and why is it critical?",
            "options": [
                "The baseline is the current level of performance before an intervention starts; it allows the coach to measure the actual effect size of the plan.",
                "The baseline is the maximum potential of the child based on their IQ score.",
                "The baseline is the average behavior of a neurotypical child of the same age.",
                "The baseline is the final goal the child is expected to reach by the end of the year."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Without a baseline, it is impossible to determine if an intervention is working or if changes in behavior are simply coincidental."

                "To synthesize assessments, goals, and sensory plans into a cohesive, prioritized roadmap for the family.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Master Plan serves as the 'North Star' for the family, ensuring that all interventions are prioritized and working toward the same long-term vision."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A child experiences a meltdown in a grocery store. Based on Lesson 5's regulation strategies, what should the parent's first priority be?",
            "options": [
                "Teaching the child why their behavior is socially inappropriate.",

                "Ignoring the behavior so as not to reinforce it with attention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a state of dysregulation, the 'thinking brain' is offline. The parent must first provide co-regulation to help the child's nervous system return to a state of safety before any teaching can occur."

                "If the child has one 'bad day' or a minor setback.",
                "When data shows a 'plateau' or declining trend over a consistent period (e.g., 2-3 weeks) despite high implementation fidelity.",

                "Only when the school year ends and a new IEP is developed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data-driven iteration requires looking at trends. If the plan is being followed correctly (fidelity) but the data shows no progress over a meaningful period, the strategy must be adjusted."
