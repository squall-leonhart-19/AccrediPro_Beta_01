            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when healthcare providers incorrectly attribute new behavioral or psychiatric symptoms to an existing intellectual or developmental disability, leading to underdiagnosis of treatable mental health conditions."

            "question": "When coaching a parent through a crisis involving aggressive behavior (L2), what is the primary objective of the 'De-escalation' phase?",

                "To implement a consequence or 'time-out' immediately.",

                "To gather data for an ABC (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence) chart."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During an active crisis, the priority is safety and physiological regulation. Teaching and consequences should only occur once the nervous system has returned to a baseline state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care emphasizes agency and predictability. Giving a child choices (e.g., which arm for a blood draw) and preparing them for sensory input helps reduce the trauma of medical interventions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility involves an ongoing commitment to self-evaluation and critique, acknowledging that the coach can never truly be an 'expert' in another person's lived cultural experience."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "question": "A client in a high-conflict divorce (L5) is upset because the other parent refuses to follow the specialized diet for their autistic son. What is the coach's best first step?",
