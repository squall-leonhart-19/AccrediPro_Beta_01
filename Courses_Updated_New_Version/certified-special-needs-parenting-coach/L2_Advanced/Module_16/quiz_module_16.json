            "question": "In the context of the 'Triad of Complexity' (Autism, ADHD, and Anxiety), which condition is typically considered the 'gatekeeper' that must be stabilized before executive function coaching can succeed?",
            "options": [
                "ADHD-driven impulsivity",
                "Autistic sensory processing",
                "Anxiety-driven avoidance",
                "Working memory deficits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anxiety acts as a gatekeeper; if a child is in a state of 'fight or flight' due to anxiety, the prefrontal cortex is offline, making it impossible to implement ADHD or executive function strategies effectively."

            "question": "The 'Transition Cliff' described in Lesson 2 refers to the sharp decline in support services that occurs when a student reaches which milestone?",

                "The transition from elementary to middle school",
                "The age of 16 when the IEP must include a transition plan",
                "High school graduation or aging out of IDEA eligibility at 21",
                "The completion of the first year of post-secondary vocational training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Transition Cliff' specifically refers to the loss of entitlement-based services under IDEA once a student graduates or turns 21, shifting to the eligibility-based (and often underfunded) adult service system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In crisis-level burnout, the parent is often in a state of chronic nervous system dysregulation. The priority is physiological restoration (sleep, nutrition, and relief) before any cognitive coaching can occur."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The vestibular system processes balance and spatial orientation. Considerations like seating stability, floor textures, or movement-based equipment (swings/elevators) fall under this category."

                "A sibling who mirrors every behavior of the neurodivergent child",
                "A child who acts as a 'buffer' or 'shield' between the parents and the neurodivergent child"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Glass Child' is a term for siblings of children with disabilities who feel their needs are transparent or secondary, often leading to suppressed emotions and a drive for perfectionism to avoid 'burdening' the parents."

            "explanation": "Prior Written Notice (PWN) is a legal requirement whenever a district proposes or refuses to change the identification, evaluation, or placement of a child. It must explain the 'why' behind their refusal."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In resource-poor areas, coaches help families map 'assets' that aren't traditional clinical services but can provide social-emotional support, sensory-friendly spaces, or respite."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When coaching a neurodivergent parent (Lesson 8), why is the 'Double Empathy Problem' a critical concept for the coach to understand?",
            "options": [
                "It explains why neurotypical parents have more empathy than neurodivergent parents",
                "It suggests that communication breakdowns are due to differing neurological processing styles rather than a deficit in one person",
                "It identifies the exact moment a parent begins to feel burnout",
                "It measures the level of empathy a child has for their sibling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties between neurodivergent and neurotypical people are a 'two-way street' caused by different ways of experiencing the world, which is vital for reducing parental shame."

            "question": "A case study in Lesson 2 highlights a student who failed their first semester of college despite having high grades in high school. What was the primary 'Missing Link' identified?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of academic intelligence",

                "The college's refusal to follow the high school IEP"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In post-secondary settings, the burden of disclosure shifts to the student. Many students fail because they have not been coached on how to self-advocate and request the accommodations they are legally entitled to under the ADA."

                "Requiring the neurotypical sibling to help with the neurodivergent child's therapy",
                "Avoiding discussions about the sibling's disability to keep the home environment 'normal'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency and predictability (protected 1:1 time) are more important than 'equal' time. It validates the sibling's individual importance and reduces the 'Glass Child' effect."
