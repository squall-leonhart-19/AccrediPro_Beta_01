            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IEPs fall under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and require 'specialized instruction,' while 504 Plans fall under civil rights law and focus on equal access through accommodations."

                "Co-regulation is a disciplinary technique used to enforce compliance through proximity.",
                "Neurodivergent children lack mirror neurons, so they must be taught regulation through cognitive behavioral strategies only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation is the prerequisite for self-regulation. By staying calm, the parent provides the external support the child's nervous system needs to return to a baseline state."
