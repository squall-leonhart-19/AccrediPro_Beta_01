            "question": "What is the fundamental difference between 'Position-Based' and 'Interest-Based' negotiation in special education advocacy?",
            "options": [
                "Position-based focuses on the specific service requested, while interest-based focuses on the underlying need the service addresses.",
                "Position-based is used for IEPs, while interest-based is used for 504 plans.",
                "Interest-based negotiation is legally binding, whereas position-based negotiation is informal.",
                "Position-based negotiation requires an attorney, while interest-based does not."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Position-based negotiation often leads to stalemates because it focuses on a specific demand (e.g., 'I want 5 hours of OT'), whereas interest-based negotiation looks at the 'why' (e.g., 'The child needs to improve fine motor skills for writing'), opening up more collaborative solutions."

            "question": "Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), what is the legal significance of 'Prior Written Notice' (PWN)?",
            "options": [
                "It is a document parents must sign before an IEP meeting can begin.",
                "It is a requirement for schools to provide a written explanation whenever they propose or refuse to change a child's placement or services.",
                "It is the notice parents give the school 10 days before filing a lawsuit.",
                "It is a summary of the child's progress sent home with every report card."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PWN is a powerful advocacy tool. It requires the school to document what they are doing (or refusing to do) and why, providing a paper trail that is essential for accountability and future negotiations."

            "options": [
                "IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)",
                "ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Section 504 is a civil rights law that ensures students with disabilities have 'equal access' to an education. Unlike IDEA, it does not provide federal funding and has a broader definition of disability."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "According to the 2017 Supreme Court ruling in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District, what is the standard for a 'Free Appropriate Public Education' (FAPE)?",
            "options": [
                "The school must provide the 'best possible' education for the student.",
                "The educational program must provide more than 'merely de minimis' (minimal) progress.",
                "The school only needs to provide services if they have the budget available.",
                "The student must be fully mainstreamed in general education 100% of the time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Endrew F. ruling raised the bar for FAPE, stating that an IEP must be 'appropriately ambitious' and that the progress must be more than just minimal; it must be meaningful in light of the child's circumstances."

                "To allow time for the court reporter to catch up on notes.",
                "To de-escalate emotional reactivity and force the other party to fill the silence with potentially useful information.",
                "To signal that the meeting is over and the parent is leaving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Silence is a strategic tool in negotiation. By pausing after a school official makes a statement, the parent avoids an emotional 'knee-jerk' reaction and often prompts the official to elaborate or clarify their position."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While some states mandate transition planning to begin at age 14, federal law (IDEA) requires it to be in place by the student's 16th birthday to prepare them for life after high school."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that strategies used in speech therapy or home behavioral intervention are reinforced in the classroom, creating a cohesive environment for the child's development."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 8 indicates that parents of children with significant needs often experience 'Advocacy Burnout.' What is a key symptom of the 'Compassion Fatigue' stage?",
            "options": [
                "Increased energy and focus on the child's IEP.",
                "Emotional numbing and a feeling of being 'trapped' by the advocacy role.",
                "A sudden improvement in the child's behavior.",
                "Perfectly organized filing systems and documentation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue involves emotional exhaustion and a sense of detachment or numbing. Resilient advocacy requires the parent to recognize these signs and implement self-care and boundaries to sustain their efforts."

            "question": "A parent is told in an IEP meeting: 'We don't provide 1:1 aides in this district.' According to Lesson 4, what is the most effective resilient advocacy response?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blanket policies (deciding what a child gets based on what the district 'has' rather than what the child 'needs') are a violation of IDEA's requirement for 'Individualized' education. Challenging the policy with a question about the law is a high-level advocacy tactic."
