            "question": "In Lesson 1, the term 'Allostatic Load' is used to describe the physiological state of many special needs parents. What does this term specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The maximum amount of weight a caregiver can physically lift",
                "The cumulative wear and tear on the body caused by chronic over-activation of stress response systems",

                "A temporary spike in adrenaline during an acute crisis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load is the 'cost' of chronic exposure to fluctuating or elevated neural or neuroendocrine responses that result from repeated or chronic stress."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Window of Tolerance' model in Lesson 2, what is the primary goal of nervous system regulation for a parent during a child's meltdown?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress all emotions until the child is asleep",
                "To move into a state of 'Hyper-arousal' to match the child's energy",
                "To remain within or return to the 'Ventral Vagal' state of safety and social engagement",
                "To enter a state of 'Hypo-arousal' to ignore the surrounding chaos"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state allows for 'co-regulation,' where the parent's calm nervous system helps soothe the child's dysregulated system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'The Myth of the Martyr.' What is a documented psychological risk of a parent adopting a martyr mindset?",
            "options": [
                "Increased child compliance due to guilt",
                "Higher levels of 'Enmeshed Caregiving,' which can stifle the child's independence and increase parental resentment",
                "Improved long-term physical health due to constant activity",
                "Enhanced community support because people admire the sacrifice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The martyr mindset often leads to enmeshment, where the parent's identity is so tied to the child's struggles that they cannot maintain the healthy boundaries needed for long-term caregiving."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, why is 'Blood Sugar Stability' highlighted as a critical nutritional strategy for high-stress parenting?",
            "options": [
                "Because parents need to lose weight to keep up with their children",
                "To prevent the 'Cortisol-Insulin' loop where low blood sugar triggers a 'fight-or-flight' response that mimics anxiety",
                "Because sugar is the only source of energy for the brain during a crisis",
                "To ensure the parent has a 'sugar high' to handle evening routines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops, the body releases cortisol and adrenaline to mobilize glucose, which can cause the parent to feel jittery, irritable, and anxious, even if no external stressor is present."

            "id": "q4_5",

                "A side effect of consuming too much caffeine in the afternoon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parents often stay up late not because they aren't tired, but because the late-night hours are the only time they feel in control of their own environment and schedule."

            "question": "Which of the following is an example of 'Micro-Respite' as defined in Lesson 6?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-respite involves short, sustainable bursts of regulation (1-10 minutes) that can be integrated into a high-demand day without needing external childcare."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "A parent tells you, 'If I were a better mother, my son wouldn't have had a meltdown at the grocery store.' Which cognitive distortion from Lesson 7 is this parent demonstrating?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personalization involves taking 100% responsibility for external events (like a child's neurological meltdown) that are influenced by many factors outside the parent's control."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MVC prevents the 'all-or-nothing' cycle of self-care by identifying tiny habits (like drinking 16oz of water or 2 minutes of stretching) that keep the parent's 'pilot light' on during crises."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 1 indicates that parents of children with significant disabilities often have morning cortisol profiles similar to which other group?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as those by Seltzer et al.) have shown that the 'blunted' morning cortisol response in high-stress caregivers mirrors that of combat veterans, indicating long-term HPA-axis exhaustion."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "When helping a client implement the 'Emotional Boundaries' strategy from Lesson 6, what is the 'Detached Compassion' technique?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Detached compassion allows a coach or parent to be present and supportive without 'absorbing' the child's nervous system state, preventing secondary traumatic stress."
