            "options": [
                "The Medical Model focuses on curing the individual, while the Social Model focuses on fixing the person's behavior to fit into society.",
                "The Social Model posits that disability is a result of the mismatch between a person’s neurological profile and an environment that fails to accommodate them.",
                "The Medical Model views neurodivergence as a natural human variation, while the Social Model views it as a pathology.",
                "The Social Model prioritizes pharmacological interventions over environmental modifications."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Social Model of disability shifts the focus away from 'fixing' the individual and toward identifying and removing environmental and societal barriers."

            "options": [
                "An IEP is for physical disabilities only, while a 504 Plan is for learning disabilities.",
                "A 504 Plan provides specialized instruction, whereas an IEP only provides environmental accommodations.",
                "An IEP requires the student to need Specially Designed Instruction (SDI), whereas a 504 Plan provides equal access through accommodations without specialized instruction.",
                "IEPs are federally funded, but 504 Plans are funded entirely by local school property taxes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To qualify for an IEP, a student must have a qualifying disability that necessitates Specially Designed Instruction (SDI). A 504 Plan provides accommodations to ensure equal access under the Rehabilitation Act."

            "explanation": "PDA is characterized by an autonomic nervous system response to demands that are perceived as threats to autonomy, triggering a 'fight-flight-freeze' response."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the 'eighth sense' that helps us understand and feel what is going on inside our bodies; challenges here lead to difficulty regulating basic physiological needs."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Glass Child' phenomenon occurs when siblings of children with disabilities feel invisible or that their needs are secondary, often leading to internalizing behaviors."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During a neurological peak (meltdown), the child's prefrontal cortex is offline. The only goal is safety and de-escalation; teaching must wait until the 'Recovery' phase."
