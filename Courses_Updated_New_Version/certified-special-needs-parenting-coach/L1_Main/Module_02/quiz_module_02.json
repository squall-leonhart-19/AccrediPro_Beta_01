            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mesosystem consists of the interactions between different components of the Microsystem. For a special needs parent, navigating this involves ensuring the home and school environments are communicating effectively."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "A 504 Plan is a legally binding federal document, whereas an IEP is only a local school agreement.",
                "An IEP is only for physical disabilities, while a 504 Plan is for learning disabilities.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Specialized Instruction' component is the hallmark of the IEP. A 504 Plan, governed by the Rehabilitation Act, focuses on 'leveling the playing field' through accommodations without necessarily changing the curriculum."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The transdisciplinary model is considered the 'gold standard' for complex needs because it reduces service fragmentation by allowing providers to share skills across disciplinary boundaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The LMN is the primary tool for overcoming insurance denials. It bridges the gap between clinical needs and the insurance company's 'medical necessity' criteria."
