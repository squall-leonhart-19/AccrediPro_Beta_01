            "question": "In the context of Environmental Optimization, what does the 'Sensory Gating' deficit specifically refer to in neurodivergent individuals?",
            "options": [
                "The inability to perceive low-level sensory stimuli in the environment",
                "The neurological failure to filter out redundant or irrelevant environmental stimuli",
                "A physical preference for enclosed spaces over open-plan environments",
                "The transition period required when moving from a high-sensory to low-sensory zone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory gating is the process the brain uses to filter out redundant stimuli. In many neurodivergent individuals, this 'gate' is less effective, leading to sensory overload as the brain attempts to process every sound, light, and texture simultaneously."

        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "When applying 'Sensory Architecture' to lighting, which Kelvin (K) range is recommended to minimize cortisol spikes and visual 'flicker' stress?",
            "options": [
                "5000K - 6500K (Daylight Blue)",
                "4000K - 5000K (Cool White)",
                "2700K - 3500K (Warm/Soft White)",
                "1000K - 2000K (Amber/Candlelight)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Warm white light (2700K-3500K) is less likely to trigger the 'flicker vertigo' or hyper-arousal associated with the blue-light spectrum found in higher Kelvin cool-white or daylight bulbs."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the primary psychological function of 'Environmental Signaling' through visual supports?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate the need for parental verbal instructions entirely",
                "To reduce cognitive load by making the 'invisible' expectations of a space 'visible'",
                "To decorate the environment in a way that is aesthetically pleasing to the child",
                "To track the child's compliance with daily chores for a reward system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental signaling uses visual cues to reduce the cognitive effort required to figure out what is happening next or what is expected in a specific area, thereby reducing anxiety and increasing autonomy."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "A 'Regulation Zone' or 'Safe Space' is most effective for down-regulating the nervous system when it incorporates which type of sensory input?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity vestibular input (spinning/swinging)",
                "Intermittent auditory signaling (metronome)",
                "Proprioceptive input (deep pressure/weighted items)",
                "High-contrast visual patterns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input, such as deep pressure from weighted blankets or 'squeeze' spaces, helps stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, aiding in emotional and physiological regulation."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Work-Station Setup' for a child with ADHD suggests the 'Visual Funnel' technique. What does this involve?",
            "options": [
                "Using a circular desk to allow for constant movement",
                "Placing the desk in the center of the room to avoid feeling 'trapped'",
                "Using desk carrels or lateral blinkers to limit peripheral visual distractions",
                "Using a multi-monitor setup to keep all tasks visible at once"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Visual Funnel' involves using physical barriers like desk carrels or positioning the desk against a neutral wall to limit the peripheral field of view, helping the child maintain focus on the task directly in front of them."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When adapting 'High-Stress Zones' like the bathroom, what is the purpose of 'Acoustic Softening'?",
            "options": [
                "To hide the sound of running water which may be a trigger",
                "To reduce the 'echo' effect caused by hard surfaces (tile/porcelain) that can amplify noise",
                "To provide a background white-noise loop to distract the child",
                "To ensure the parent can hear the child from another room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bathrooms are often 'acoustically live' due to hard surfaces. Acoustic softening (mats, fabric shower curtains, towels) reduces the reverberation and echo that can make bathroom sounds physically painful for children with auditory sensitivities."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In the 'Community Readiness' lesson, what are the 'Big Three' factors a coach should audit when preparing a client for a new public location?",
            "options": [
                "Cost, Distance, and Parking",
                "Exit routes, Staff friendliness, and Food options",
                "Sensory Density, Predictability, and Escape Points",
                "Visual appeal, Educational value, and Social opportunities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A successful community outing depends on understanding the Sensory Density (how crowded/loud), Predictability (knowing the schedule), and Escape Points (where to go if a meltdown occurs)."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Sustainable Systems (Lesson 8) suggests that an environment must 'evolve.' How often is a formal 'Environmental Audit' recommended for a growing neurodivergent child?",
            "options": [
                "Once every 2 years",
                "Only when a major behavioral crisis occurs",
                "Every 6 months to align with developmental shifts",
                "Monthly, to keep the child from getting 'bored' with the space"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because sensory profiles and developmental needs change rapidly, a formal audit every 6 months ensures the environment continues to support the child's current level of function rather than their past needs."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Liam' (8) struggles with transitions from the living room to the dinner table. Which environmental modification is a 'Level 1' antecedent intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Removing dessert if he does not come to the table",
                "Installing a 'Transition Path' using colored floor tape from the sofa to his chair",
                "Physically carrying him to the table to ensure compliance",
                "Changing the dinner menu to only his favorite foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Transition Path' (Environmental Signaling) provides a clear, visual, and predictable map for the transition, reducing the cognitive load and anxiety associated with shifting tasks."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module found that reducing visual 'clutter' (posters, bright colors) on walls by 25-50% resulted in what outcome for neurodivergent learners?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in 'on-task' behavior and reduced cortisol levels",
                "A 5% decrease in academic performance due to lack of stimulation",
                "No significant change in behavior",
                "An increase in 'daydreaming' behaviors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research shows that 'visual noise' significantly impacts executive function; reducing this clutter allows the brain to allocate more resources to the primary task, increasing 'on-task' behavior by approximately 15%."
