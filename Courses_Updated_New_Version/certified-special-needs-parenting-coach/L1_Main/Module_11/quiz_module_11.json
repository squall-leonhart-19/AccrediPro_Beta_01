            "question": "When applying the 'Assess & Align' phase during a high-stress transition, such as moving from a residential facility back to the home, what is the coach’s primary clinical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Drafting a new 5-year educational transition plan",
                "Stabilizing the immediate sensory and safety environment to prevent nervous system overload",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-stress transitions, the ANCHOR Method™ prioritizes immediate stabilization and safety (alignment of environment and capacity) before long-term goal setting can be effective."

            ],

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the Neuro-Relational Approach to 'Compassionate Connection,' why is a parent’s self-regulation considered the 'primary intervention'?",
            "options": [
                "Because parents are legally responsible for their child's behavior",
                "Because a regulated adult nervous system is required to provide the 'biological anchor' for a child’s co-regulation",
                "To ensure the parent has the energy to complete household chores",
                "To prove to the medical team that the parent is competent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neuro-Relational approach posits that co-regulation is a bottom-up biological process; a child cannot regulate if the parent's nervous system is in a state of high arousal or collapse."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout is about exhaustion, STS involves trauma symptoms—like intrusive thoughts or hypervigilance—resulting from witnessing or managing the child's traumatic experiences."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced environmental optimization looks beyond obvious triggers to 'hidden' stressors like visual complexity (clutter) and auditory processing loads (appliance hums) that drain the child's regulatory budget."

            "question": "In 'Strategic Resilient Advocacy,' what is the primary benefit of using 'Interest-Based Negotiation' during an IEP meeting?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the parent to demand the most expensive services available",
                "It focuses on the underlying 'why' (the child's needs) rather than a rigid 'what' (a specific brand of therapy), fostering collaboration",
                "It ensures the school district pays for all legal fees",
                "It speeds up the meeting by avoiding all discussion of data"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interest-based negotiation moves away from adversarial 'positions' and focuses on shared interests, which is more likely to result in sustainable, creative solutions for the child."

                "Calculate the total hourly cost of all therapies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The coach ensures 'Intervention Alignment,' preventing 'therapeutic overload' where the sheer volume or conflicting nature of therapies causes more stress than benefit."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 covers 'Long-Term Visioning.' What is the core philosophy of 'Supported Decision-Making' (SDM) in the ANCHOR Method™?",
            "options": [
                "The parent should make all decisions until the child is 21",
                "The individual with a disability retains legal rights while using a 'support network' to help understand and communicate choices",
                "The state should take over decision-making once the individual turns 18",
                "Decisions should be made based purely on the lowest financial cost"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SDM is an alternative to guardianship that prioritizes the individual's autonomy and self-determination, which is a key goal of the ANCHOR Method's lifespan approach."

                "No change in stress levels",
                "A 34% reduction in 'caregiver strain' and improved family cohesion",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Structured implementation of coordination and alignment methods significantly reduces the subjective burden of care (caregiver strain) and improves overall family function."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "In the case study of 'The Miller Family,' the coach identified that the child's 'behavioral outbursts' were actually 'environmentally induced dysregulation.' Which ANCHOR step was used to solve this?",
            "options": [
                "Navigate Systems",
                "Optimize Environment (specifically reducing visual and auditory 'noise')",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By 'Optimizing the Environment' through a sensory audit, the coach was able to identify that the physical space—not a lack of discipline—was the root cause of the dysregulation."
