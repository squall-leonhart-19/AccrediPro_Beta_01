            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "What is the primary distinction between a clinical diagnosis and a neurodevelopmental coaching assessment as taught in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Clinical diagnosis identifies the pathology; coaching assessment identifies the functional capacity and environmental fit.",
                "Clinical diagnosis is performed by doctors; coaching assessment is performed by teachers.",
                "Clinical diagnosis focuses on the future; coaching assessment focuses on the past.",
                "There is no distinction; both use the DSM-5 to categorize child behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While clinical diagnosis categorizes a condition based on pathology (DSM-5 criteria), the coaching assessment focuses on how the child functions within their specific environment and identifies the 'fit' between their profile and family demands."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A child who frequently 'crashes' into furniture, exhibits high pain tolerance, and uses excessive force when petting a dog is likely demonstrating hyposensitivity in which sensory system?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular",
                "Proprioceptive",
                "Interoceptive",
                "Tactile"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioception is the 'body awareness' system located in muscles and joints. Hyposensitivity (under-responsiveness) often leads to 'sensory seeking' behaviors like crashing, jumping, or using heavy pressure to feel where the body is in space."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, Executive Function is described as the 'Air Traffic Control' of the brain. Which skill is responsible for the ability to 'shift gears' between different tasks or rules?",
            "options": [
                "Working Memory",
                "Inhibitory Control",
                "Cognitive Flexibility",
                "Emotional Regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Flexibility (or Set Shifting) is the executive function that allows an individual to transition between tasks, adjust to new information, or change perspectives when rules change."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "During the Alignment Phase (Lesson 4), why is it vital to distinguish between 'Values' and 'Goals'?",
            "options": [
                "Goals are the destination; Values are the compass that ensures the destination is actually desired by the family.",
                "Values are only for the coach; Goals are only for the parents.",
                "Goals are permanent; Values change every week based on child behavior.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in the AccrediPro methodology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Values represent the ongoing 'way of being' and the compass for the family, whereas goals are specific, time-bound achievements. Aligning goals with values ensures long-term parenting sustainability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In the 'Gap Analysis' (Lesson 5), what does the term 'Zone of Proximal Development' (ZPD) refer to in a coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "The gap between what a child can do alone and what they can do with support.",
                "The physical distance between the child's home and their school.",
                "The time it takes for a parent to reach a state of burnout.",
                "The statistical average of a child's IQ score compared to their peers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The ZPD is the 'sweet spot' for intervention—the space where the child is challenged enough to grow but supported enough to avoid failure and meltdown."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "According to the Social Model of Disability (Lesson 6), a child with ADHD is 'disabled' primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "Their brain lacks sufficient dopamine.",
                "They have a medical deficit that needs to be cured.",
                "The environment (e.g., a rigid 6-hour classroom) is not designed for their neurobiology.",
                "Their parents have not implemented enough discipline."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Social Model posits that disability is a result of the interaction between a person’s impairment and an environment filled with barriers, rather than the impairment being an inherent 'defect' of the person."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "During the Coaching Intake (Lesson 7), the 'OARS' technique is used to build rapport. What does the 'R' in OARS stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Radical Acceptance",
                "Reflective Listening",
                "Rigid Assessment",
                "Rapid Response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "OARS stands for Open-ended questions, Affirmations, Reflective listening, and Summaries. Reflective listening helps the parent feel understood and validates their experience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Assess & Align Roadmap' synthesized in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a rigid 12-month schedule that the family must follow without deviation.",
                "To create a visual representation of the child's deficits for school records.",
                "To bridge the gap between the child's neuro-profile and the family's core values with actionable steps.",
                "To prove to the parents that their current parenting style is incorrect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Roadmap is a synthesis tool that takes the data gathered (Sensory, EF, Values) and turns it into a strategic, individualized path forward that aligns the child's needs with the family's vision."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A parent reports that their child is 'defiant' and 'refuses to clean their room.' Upon assessment, you find the child has significant deficits in 'Working Memory' and 'Task Initiation.' How does this change the coaching approach?",
            "options": [
                "The coach should recommend stricter punishments for non-compliance.",
                "The coach re-frames the 'defiance' as a 'skill lag,' shifting from a behavioral focus to a structural support focus.",
                "The coach suggests the child be tested for Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) immediately.",
                "The coach ignores the room cleaning and focuses only on the parent's self-care."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recognizing that 'won't' is often 'can't' (a skill lag in Executive Function) allows the coach to help the parent implement external supports (checklists, body doubling) rather than relying on punitive measures."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Lesson 6 highlights that children from marginalized communities are often diagnosed 2-3 years later than their peers. What is a critical 'Assess & Align' consideration for a coach working with these families?",
            "options": [
                "The family likely has 'diagnosis fatigue' and needs less information.",
                "The coach must account for 'compounded trauma' and potential systemic distrust during the intake process.",
                "The coach should assume the parents are less involved in the child's education.",
                "Cultural differences do not impact the assessment phase of coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic barriers and late diagnoses often lead to higher levels of stress and trauma. A culturally competent coach must acknowledge these factors to build a safe, trusting relationship during the Assess & Align phase."
