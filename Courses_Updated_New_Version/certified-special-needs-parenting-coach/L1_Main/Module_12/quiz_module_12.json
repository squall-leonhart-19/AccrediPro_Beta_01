            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is a term coined by Dr. Stephen Porges describing how the neural circuits distinguish whether situations or people are safe, dangerous, or life-threatening without conscious thought."

                "Values-based goals focus on fixing the child's neurological weaknesses.",
                "Values-based goals are determined solely by the school district's available resources.",
                "Values-based goals align with the family's core beliefs and long-term vision for quality of life.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Values-based goals prioritize the family's unique 'North Star' and quality of life, whereas deficit-based goals focus narrowly on what the child cannot do compared to neurotypical peers."

                "Medical diagnoses are irrelevant to the school's evaluation process.",

                "Schools are legally required to follow a doctor's prescription for specific classroom placements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Having a medical diagnosis (clinical) does not automatically qualify a student for services; the school must determine if the condition adversely impacts their educational performance (educational eligibility)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional attunement involves the parent/coach being 'with' the child in their distress, mirroring the intensity to show understanding while providing a regulated nervous system for the child to 'borrow'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioception provides information about body position and force. Children who 'crash' or 'thump' are often seeking 'heavy work' input to ground their nervous system."
