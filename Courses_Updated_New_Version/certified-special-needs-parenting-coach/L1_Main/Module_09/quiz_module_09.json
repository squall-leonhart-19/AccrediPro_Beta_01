                "Negotiate: Focusing on conflict resolution between parents and school districts.",
                "Navigate: Focusing on building and managing the support ecosystem and systems of care.",

            "question": "When decoding a neurodevelopmental profile (Lesson 2), a coach observes a child who frequently bumps into furniture and seeks tight hugs. This behavior most likely indicates a need for which type of sensory input?",
            "options": [
                "Proprioceptive input (Deep pressure and joint position)",
                "Vestibular input (Balance and movement)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bumping into objects and seeking deep pressure are classic signs of a need for proprioceptive input, which helps the brain understand where the body is in space."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation and the establishment of physiological safety (ventral vagal state) are prerequisites for higher-level cognitive processing and behavioral self-regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into caregiver stress has shown that chronic stress can lead to shortened telomeres, effectively aging the caregiver's cells by roughly a decade compared to low-stress peers."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "When optimizing a sensory-friendly home environment (Lesson 6), which lighting choice is recommended to reduce visual overstimulation and 'flicker vertigo'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fluorescent lighting and high-blue LEDs can cause visual fatigue and sensory overload; warm, indirect, and dimmable lighting provides a more regulated environment."

            "question": "In Lesson 7 (Resilient Advocacy), the 'Collaborative Proactive Solutions' (CPS) model suggests that 'kids do well if they can.' If they can't, what is the primary cause according to this model?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of consistent discipline at home.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CPS model, often used in advocacy, posits that behavioral challenges are the result of lagging skills rather than a lack of will or poor parenting."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
