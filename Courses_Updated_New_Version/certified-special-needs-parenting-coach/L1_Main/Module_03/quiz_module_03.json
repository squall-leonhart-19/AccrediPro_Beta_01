            "question": "Which neurobiological system is primarily responsible for 'social engagement' and allows a child to down-regulate their fight-or-flight response through a parent's calm voice and facial expressions?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (Polyvagal Theory)",
                "The HPA Axis",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Shutdown System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is the 'social engagement system' that promotes safety and connection, effectively 'braking' the sympathetic nervous system's stress response."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'decoding' non-verbal cues in non-speaking children involves looking for 'micro-transitions.' What does a sudden increase in 'stimming' or repetitive motor movements usually indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A sign of intentional defiance or manipulation",
                "A decrease in interest in the current activity",
                "An attempt to self-regulate against increasing sensory or emotional arousal",
                "A neurological 'glitch' that should be ignored to avoid reinforcement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stimming is often a functional self-regulatory behavior used to manage sensory input or emotional intensity when the internal nervous system is taxed."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "The concept of the 'Parent as the External Nervous System' (Lesson 3) relies heavily on which neurological mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow the child to 'catch' the parent's physiological state; if the parent is calm, the child's brain begins to mirror that state, facilitating co-regulation."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis mentioned in Lesson 4 found that mindful parenting interventions significantly reduced child externalizing behaviors. What was identified as the primary 'buffer' for the child's stress?",
            "options": [
                "The parent's ability to strictly enforce consequences",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parental presence and the ability to remain non-reactive act as a biological buffer, lowering the child's cortisol levels even in stressful situations."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "When applying 'Empathy-First Communication' (Lesson 5), which of these is a 'Validation' statement that avoids the 'Fix-It Trap'?",
            "options": [
                "'Don't be sad, we can go to the store tomorrow instead.'",
                "'I understand you're frustrated, but you need to stop screaming.'",
                "'It makes total sense that you're angry because that transition was really sudden.'",
                "'If you calm down, I will help you fix the toy.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validation acknowledges the logic and feeling of the child's experience without immediately jumping to behavior correction or problem-solving."

                "Perfect attunement 100% of the time",
                "Being 'in sync' 1/3 of the time, out of sync 1/3, and repairing 1/3",

                "Repairing only the major ruptures while ignoring minor daily friction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research by Ed Tronick shows that even in the best relationships, we are only 'in sync' about 30% of the time. The key is the successful transition from mismatch back to connection (repair)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A parent cannot co-regulate a child if they are dysregulated themselves. Sarah must first stabilize her own nervous system to become the 'calm anchor' for Liam."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, building trust through 'Predictability' is emphasized. For a child with ADHD or sensory processing challenges, why is predictability so therapeutic?",
            "options": [
                "It reduces the 'cognitive load' of wondering what happens next, lowering anxiety",
                "It teaches the child that they have no control over their environment",
                "It ensures the parent never has to deal with unexpected behaviors",
                "It is only useful for younger children, not teenagers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Predictability creates 'felt safety.' When the brain knows what to expect, the amygdala remains quiet, allowing the higher brain centers to function."

                "The coach and parent should work on the same goals simultaneously",
                "The way the coach supports and validates the parent is how the parent will eventually support the child",
                "The child's behavior will always parallel the parent's behavior exactly",
                "Coaching should only happen in parallel with medical interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The coach models the compassionate connection. By experiencing empathy from the coach, the parent’s 'attachment battery' is recharged, allowing them to offer the same to their child."

            "options": [
                "Competition (teaching the child how to win and lose)",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nurture is one of the four dimensions of Theraplay (along with Structure, Engagement, and Challenge) used to foster a sense of being cared for and safe."
