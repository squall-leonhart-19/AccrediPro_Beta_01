            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to charge lower rates to attract more volume",
                "It reduces the 'search friction' for parents looking for specific diagnostic expertise",
                "Generalist coaching is legally prohibited in most states",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-niching reduces 'search friction' by positioning the coach as a specialist for a specific challenge (e.g., Pathological Demand Avoidance), which builds immediate trust with parents who feel misunderstood by generalists."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Value-based packaging focuses on the outcome (the transformation) and prevents the 'nickel-and-diming' mentality that leads to cancellations when families face the inevitable financial fluctuations of special needs parenting."
