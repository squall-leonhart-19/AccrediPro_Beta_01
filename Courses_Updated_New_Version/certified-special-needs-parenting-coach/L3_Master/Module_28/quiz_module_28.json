            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary difference between a 'Behavioral Escalation' and a 'Clinical Crisis' as defined in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Behavioral escalation is always violent, while clinical crises are quiet and internal.",
                "Clinical crises involve neurochemical dysregulation where the individual loses the 'willful' ability to self-regulate, whereas behavioral escalation is often goal-oriented or communicative.",
                "Behavioral escalation requires immediate medication, while clinical crises require firm boundary setting.",
                "There is no clinical difference; the terms are used interchangeably in professional coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A clinical crisis involves a total breakdown of the nervous system's ability to regulate, meaning the child is no longer in 'control' of their actions, whereas behavioral escalation often serves a specific function or goal."

            "options": [
                "Maintaining firm, direct eye contact to assert authority.",
                "Standing directly in front of the individual to block their path.",
                "Adopting a side-on (staggered) stance and avoiding prolonged direct eye contact.",
                "Using loud, rhythmic clapping to break the individual's 'trance'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Low-Arousal Approach emphasizes reducing perceived threat by adopting a non-confrontational side-on stance and reducing eye contact, which can be perceived as aggressive by a dysregulated brain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when healthcare providers wrongly assume that a person's behavior is just 'part of their autism/disability' rather than recognizing a treatable co-occurring mental health condition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Softening involves creating a safe space that doesn't feel like a 'cell,' focusing on removing high-risk items (ligature points, projectiles) while keeping the environment calming and dignified."

                "Burnout only happens to professionals, while STS only happens to parents.",
                "There is no difference; STS is simply a more modern term for burnout."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout is a state of emotional exhaustion due to prolonged stress, STS involves intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal specifically linked to the traumatic events experienced by the child."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LRE is a legal and ethical principle stating that interventions should be as non-intrusive as possible while still ensuring safety and effective treatment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Glass Child' refers to the sibling who is healthy/typically developing but feels invisible because their parents 'look right through them' to the child with more demanding needs."

                "Advise the parent to ignore the child completely and leave the room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-arousal techniques involve 'mirroring' the desired calm, reducing verbal demands, and providing a safe 'escape' or 'exit' to lower the child's perceived threat level."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that roughly 30-40% of individuals with IDD also have a diagnosable mental health condition, which is significantly higher than the general population (approx. 2-3 times higher)."
