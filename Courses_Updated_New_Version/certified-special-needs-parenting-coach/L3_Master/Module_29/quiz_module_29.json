            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Network Alignment focuses on the strategic synchronization of all providers (medical, educational, therapeutic) to ensure that interventions are complementary rather than contradictory or overwhelming for the family."

                "The parent becoming too focused on labels rather than functional skills",
                "A child receiving a diagnosis that is later proven to be incorrect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when clinicians or caregivers attribute new symptoms or behaviors solely to a pre-existing condition (like Autism or Down Syndrome), potentially missing treatable medical or psychological co-morbidities."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Coaches identify leverage points where a small, strategic intervention yields the highest impact. The transition from evaluation to placement is a critical window where data is translated into legally mandated services."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep Attunement requires the coach to teach parents how to read subtle somatic cues and provide significant 'wait-time' (often 10-30 seconds) for the child's nervous system to process and respond."

                "It refers specifically to the financial burden of caregiving"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic Load is the cumulative physiological toll of chronic stress. In special needs parenting, this often results from years of hyper-vigilance, sleep deprivation, and navigating complex systems."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Cliff Effect' describes the sharp drop-off in mandated supports and therapeutic services that occurs when a student ages out of the school system (usually at 18 or 21) and enters the adult service world."

                "Individual advocacy is free, while systemic advocacy requires a lawyer",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic advocacy seeks to address the root cause of recurring issues (like a lack of inclusive seating in all district schools) rather than just solving the issue for a single client."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflexive practice is a hallmark of master-level coaching, where the practitioner constantly analyzes their own influence on the coaching relationship and adjusts their approach based on outcomes and ethics."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory Zoning (creating specific areas for high-regulation vs. low-regulation) reduces 'neurological friction,' making the environment more intuitive and reducing the constant need for parental redirection."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Caregiver longevity is a prerequisite for child progress. In cases of high STS, the coach must prioritize the parent's physiological regulation (Micro-Rest) before the parent can effectively implement complex strategies for the child."
