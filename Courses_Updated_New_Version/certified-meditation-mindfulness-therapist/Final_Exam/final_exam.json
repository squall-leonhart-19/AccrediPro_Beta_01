            "options": [
                "To achieve a state of deep relaxation and sleepiness.",
                "To conduct a comprehensive assessment of physiological tension and current cognitive state.",
                "To immediately eliminate all physical pain through visualization.",
                "To diagnose specific medical conditions based on body sensations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Scanning is the foundational assessment phase where the therapist helps the client identify the physical manifestations of stress and their current mental state, providing a baseline for the session."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "The 'E' for Embracing Presence emphasizes 'radical acceptance.' According to the methodology, how does this reduce psychological suffering?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Embracing Presence teaches that suffering = pain x resistance. By removing the resistance (the 'second arrow'), the client can process the original emotion more effectively."

            "id": "final_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regulating Response utilizes breathwork and grounding to stimulate the Vagus nerve and activate the Parasympathetic Nervous System (rest and digest), countering the fight-or-flight response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Backdraft occurs when love/compassion meets old pain. Therapists should use titration (pacing) and move to a neutral anchor (like the soles of the feet) to keep the client within their window of tolerance."

                "To ensure the client is grounded and regulated before attempting deep psychological inquiry.",
