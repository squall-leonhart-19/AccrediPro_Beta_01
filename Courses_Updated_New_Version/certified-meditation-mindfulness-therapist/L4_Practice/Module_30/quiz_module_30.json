            "question": "According to the lesson on Professional Scope, what is the primary legal distinction between a Meditation Therapist and a Licensed Clinical Psychologist?",
            "options": [
                "Meditation Therapists cannot charge for their services, whereas Psychologists can.",
                "Meditation Therapists focus on self-regulation and wellness, whereas Psychologists diagnose and treat clinical mental disorders found in the DSM-5.",
                "Psychologists are not allowed to use mindfulness techniques in their sessions.",
                "There is no legal distinction; both roles are identical in most jurisdictions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The professional scope of a Meditation Therapist is centered on wellness, stress reduction, and self-regulation. Diagnosing and treating clinical pathologies (like MDD or Schizophrenia) is strictly reserved for licensed clinical professionals."

            "question": "In Brand Positioning (L2), why is 'Niche Identification' considered a financial accelerator for a new practice?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the therapist to market to everyone simultaneously.",
                "It reduces the need for professional insurance.",
                "Specific expertise in a narrow field (e.g., mindfulness for high-stakes litigation) allows for premium pricing and lower acquisition costs.",
                "It eliminates the need for a website or digital presence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Niche identification positions the therapist as a specialist rather than a generalist. Specialists solve specific, high-value problems, which justifies higher fees and makes marketing more efficient by targeting a specific demographic."

                "To provide a free 45-minute therapy session to prove their worth.",
                "To collect credit card information immediately before the client speaks.",
                "To assess 'fit,' identify the client's 'gap' between current state and desired state, and establish professional authority.",
                "To convince a client who is clearly not ready for change to sign up anyway."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The discovery call is a screening and conversion tool. Its goal is to ensure the client is right for the program and to highlight the transformation (the gap) that the therapist provides."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 7' is a marketing principle suggesting a prospect needs to 'hear' the advertiser's message at least 7 times before they'll take action to buy."

            "options": [
                "It allows the therapist to work fewer hours while providing deeper transformations and earning higher revenue.",
                "It is easier to calculate for tax purposes.",
                "Clients prefer paying by the minute because it feels more transparent.",
                "It prevents the therapist from having to use a calendar."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing penalizes efficiency. Value-based pricing (package pricing) focuses on the outcome and transformation, decoupling the therapist's income from the number of hours spent sitting in a chair."

                "Clients judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (most intense point) and at its end.",
                "The middle of a 12-week program is the most important part for retention.",
                "Retention is only possible if the therapist provides gifts at every session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychologically, clients remember the most intense part of the experience and the conclusion. Ensuring a powerful 'peak' in the session and a supportive, clear 'end' to the program boosts overall satisfaction and retention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaling requires moving beyond trading time for money. Transitioning to group programs or digital assets allows the therapist to impact more people without a linear increase in workload."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active crisis intervention for suicidal ideation is a clinical emergency. A meditation therapist must have clear referral pathways to licensed mental health professionals or emergency services for issues outside their scope."

            "options": [
                "It allows the therapist to stop talking to clients entirely.",
                "It removes the 'human element' from therapy.",
                "It reduces administrative friction (booking, billing, reminders), allowing the therapist to focus 100% on the clinical/coaching work.",
                "It guarantees that every client will reach enlightenment within 3 days."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Automation handles the repetitive, non-therapeutic tasks of the business. By automating scheduling and billing, the therapist prevents burnout and ensures a professional, seamless experience for the client."
