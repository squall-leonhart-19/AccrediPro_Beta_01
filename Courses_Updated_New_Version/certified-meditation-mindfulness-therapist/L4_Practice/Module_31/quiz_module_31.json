            "question": "According to Lesson 1, why is 'Authority Positioning' through a micro-niche more effective than being a generalist mindfulness practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "It allows you to charge lower prices to attract more people.",
                "It reduces the 'Perceived Risk' for the client by demonstrating specific expertise in their unique struggle.",
                "It requires less clinical training and fewer certifications.",
                "It ensures that you never have to deal with complex psychological issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Authority positioning in a niche (e.g., 'Mindfulness for Tech Executives with Burnout') reduces the client's perceived risk because the practitioner appears to have a specific solution for a specific problem, allowing for higher trust and premium pricing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "In 'Outcome-Based Pricing' (Lesson 2), what is the primary factor used to determine the investment for a high-ticket program?",
            "options": [
                "The total number of hours the therapist spends with the client.",
                "The cost of the therapist's office rent and overhead.",
                "The emotional and physical value of the 'Transformation' or 'End Result' for the client.",
                "The average hourly rate of local competitors in the same zip code."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket programs move away from 'trading time for dollars' and instead price based on the value of the outcome (e.g., saving a marriage or ending chronic insomnia), which is often far more valuable than the sum of the hourly sessions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "When implementing an 'Ethical Content Strategy' (Lesson 3), what is the recommended ratio of 'Educational/Value Content' to 'Direct Sales/Promotion Content'?",

                "100% Education / 0% Sales"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule in educational marketing builds 'Pre-Sold Authority' by providing genuine value and insight first, which earns the right to make a promotional offer in the remaining 20% of content."

        {
            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "In the S.E.R.E.N.E. Sales Framework, what does the 'N' stand for, and why is it critical for ethical enrollment?",
            "options": [
                "Negotiation; it's used to discount the price until the client says yes.",
                "Neutrality; it ensures the therapist is more committed to the client's best interest than 'closing the deal.'",
                "Networking; it involves asking the client for three referrals before they sign up.",
                "Novelty; it uses 'shiny object' tactics to keep the client's attention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neutrality is the hallmark of ethical sales in therapy. It means the therapist remains unattached to the outcome of the call, focusing instead on whether the program is genuinely the right fit for the client's needs."

                "Sending a generic form letter to local clinics once a year."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective partnerships are built on mutual value. By providing educational resources (like a 'Mindfulness Guide for Chronic Pain') to a physical therapist, you demonstrate value to their clients and establish yourself as a trusted expert."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A lead magnet (e.g., a free guided meditation or PDF guide) offers immediate value in exchange for an email address, allowing the therapist to nurture the relationship over time via email marketing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid Model is the gold standard for scaling. It allows clients to learn the core theory through recorded modules while using live sessions for high-level coaching, implementation, and community support."

            "id": "q31_8",

                "It is actually cheaper to find new clients than to keep old ones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Industry data consistently shows that Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is 5-7 times higher than the cost of retention. High Lifetime Value (LTV) is achieved by creating 'Ascension Paths' where clients move into graduate or maintenance programs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "In the S.E.R.E.N.E. framework, the 'R' stands for 'Reveal.' What is being revealed during this stage of the enrollment call?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Reveal' phase helps the client see the 'Gap'—the distance between where they are now and where they want to be—and the 'Cost of Inaction' if they do not address their current challenges."

        {
            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "A therapist has reached 'Capacity' with 20 one-on-one clients and is experiencing burnout. Based on Lesson 7, what is the most strategic next step?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a practitioner hits a 'time ceiling,' the strategic move is to leverage their expertise through a group model. This allows them to help more people simultaneously, often increasing revenue while significantly reducing the number of delivery hours."
