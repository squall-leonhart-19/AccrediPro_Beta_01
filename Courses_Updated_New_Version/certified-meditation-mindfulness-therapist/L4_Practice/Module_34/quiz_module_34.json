            "question": "According to Social Baseline Theory discussed in Lesson 1, how does the presence of a regulated group affect an individual's neural processing?",
            "options": [
                "It increases metabolic demand as the brain must monitor more social cues.",
                "It decreases the neural cost of emotional regulation through 'risk distribution'.",
                "It has no measurable effect on the individual's baseline metabolic rate.",
                "It increases amygdala activation due to the inherent threat of social judgment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Baseline Theory suggests that the brain treats social proximity as the 'baseline' state, and being in a regulated group reduces the metabolic and neural effort required for individual self-regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Evolution' phase (the final 'E' in SERENE) focuses on ensuring the participant can sustain the practice independently and integrate the experience into their daily life."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The priority is stabilization and grounding (bringing the person back to the present moment) without dismantling the safety of the group environment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In group facilitation, vertical inquiry dives deep into a single participant's process, while horizontal inquiry weaves that individual experience back into the shared group narrative or theme."

            "options": [
                "Because facilitators often eat, sleep, and live in the same space as participants.",
                "Because retreats are usually held in international locations with different laws.",
                "Because participants are required to sign more waivers for retreats.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The intensive, 24/7 nature of retreats creates 'living-learning' environments where professional boundaries can easily blur, requiring heightened ethical vigilance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term sustainability is best achieved by fostering peer support and 'interdependence' rather than 'dependence' on the therapist."
