            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 2 (Integration) is designed to bridge the gap between formal practice and daily life, focusing on emotional regulation and cognitive reframing to turn temporary states into lasting traits."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FFMQ is the preferred tool for advanced client profiling as it provides a nuanced view of five specific facets of mindfulness, whereas the MAAS primarily measures general presence."

            "options": [
                "To increase the dopamine reward following a behavior",
                "To reduce the cognitive load by automating the 'trigger-response' mechanism",
                "To improve the client's self-esteem through positive affirmations",
                "To eliminate the need for an anchor habit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions reduce the need for conscious willpower by creating a pre-determined neural link between a specific cue (If) and a behavior (Then)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation describes how the physiological and emotional states of group members influence and stabilize one another, which is a key benefit of collective mindfulness protocols."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "When measuring outcomes (L5), what does a 'Cohen’s d' value of 0.8 typically represent in the context of a mindfulness intervention?",
            "options": [
                "A small effect size with little clinical significance",
                "A medium effect size indicating moderate improvement",

                "An invalid result requiring a larger sample size"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In statistics, a Cohen’s d of 0.8 or higher is categorized as a 'large' effect size, suggesting the intervention had a substantial impact on the participants."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "For 'High-Stress Environments' (L6), why does the SERENE framework prioritize 'Micro-interventions' (3-5 minutes) over traditional 45-minute sits?",
            "options": [
                "Because long meditations are dangerous for everyone",
                "To lower the barrier to entry and prevent 're-traumatization' in hyper-vigilant populations",
                "Because short meditations produce more alpha waves than long ones",
                "To allow the therapist to charge more per minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-stress niches like first responders, long periods of silence can trigger hyper-vigilance or trauma; micro-interventions provide 'doses' of regulation without overwhelming the nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Redundancy Principle suggests that learners process information better from graphics and narration rather than graphics, narration, and on-screen text combined, which can cause cognitive overload."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Lead Magnet (e.g., a guided meditation or PDF guide) is a strategic tool used to build an email list and establish authority with potential clients before they commit to higher-priced programs."

                "Suggest: 'After I pour my first cup of coffee, I will sit for 5 minutes of mindful breathing'",

                "Suggest: 'I will meditate at 3:00 PM when I am usually tired'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking works by using an existing, 'anchored' habit (pouring coffee) as the trigger for a new habit, ensuring the new behavior has a consistent place in the client's routine."
