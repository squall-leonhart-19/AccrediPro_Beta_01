            "options": [
                "To increase the intensity of the traumatic memory for faster processing",
                "To break down overwhelming sensations or memories into small, manageable 'bites' to stay within the Window of Tolerance",
                "To ensure the client remains in a deep meditative state for at least 30 minutes",
                "To eliminate the need for grounding techniques by focusing only on the breath"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves slowing down the process and working with small 'doses' of experience to prevent re-traumatization and keep the client within their Window of Tolerance."

                "The mental and emotional overlay of resistance, anxiety, and catastrophic thinking about the pain",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Primary suffering is the raw physical sensation; secondary suffering is the 'second arrow'—the psychological reaction and resistance to that sensation which mindfulness aims to decouple."

                "By allowing the athlete to think about their technique more intensely during competition",
                "By reducing self-consciousness and 'quieting' the Default Mode Network, allowing for task-absorption",
                "By helping the athlete ignore physical exhaustion entirely",
                "By ensuring the athlete never experiences a loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness facilitates flow by reducing the 'inner critic' and self-referential processing (DMN), enabling the athlete to be fully present with the task."

                "It encourages the client to ignore the loss and focus exclusively on restoration",
                "It provides the emotional regulation needed to oscillate healthily between grieving the loss and engaging in life restoration",
