            "options": [
                "To increase the length of the meditation session incrementally each week.",
                "To process traumatic memories in small, manageable 'doses' to prevent flooding.",
                "To ensure the client remains in a state of deep relaxation for at least 20 minutes.",
                "To switch between different types of meditation to keep the client engaged."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves slowing down the processing of trauma and breaking it into small, manageable pieces to ensure the client stays within their Window of Tolerance and avoids emotional flooding."

                "Ask them to close their eyes and focus harder on the sensation of the breath.",
                "Direct their attention outward to 5 neutral objects in the room (Grounding).",
                "Instruct them to perform a body scan to find where the anxiety is held."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is dysregulated or panicking, shifting from internal focus (breath/body) to external grounding (5-4-3-2-1 technique) helps stabilize the nervous system and pull them out of a localized panic response."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active psychosis and hallucinations are 'Red Light' conditions where traditional silent, internal meditation can exacerbate symptoms; grounding and reality-based interventions are required instead."

                "To distract the client from their thoughts using guided imagery of a safe place.",
                "To suppress the thoughts so they no longer occur in the future."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Decentering allows the client to create a 'gap' between the self and the thought, viewing the urge as a passing 'mental weather pattern' rather than an obligation to act."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In C-PTSD, the Inner Critic is often an internalized version of an abuser (introject) that uses shame as a survival mechanism to keep the individual 'small' and safe from external threat."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urge Surfing teaches that cravings are like waves; they have a starting point, a peak (crescendo), and a natural decline. Mindfulness helps the client 'ride' the wave without acting on it."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model suggests that healthy grieving involves moving between facing the loss and engaging in life/restoration, rather than staying stuck in one mode."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual Awareness involves keeping one foot in the present (naming room objects) while acknowledging the other foot is in the past (the flashback), preventing the client from being fully 'pulled under' by the memory."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
