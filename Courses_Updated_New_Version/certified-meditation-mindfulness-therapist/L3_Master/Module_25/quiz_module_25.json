            "options": [
                "Mentoring focuses on business growth, while supervision focuses on client outcomes.",
                "Supervision involves a formal evaluative component and legal responsibility for client welfare, whereas mentoring is more focused on personal and professional development.",
                "Mentoring is only for beginners, while supervision is reserved for Master Level practitioners.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in mindfulness therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical supervision carries a formal gatekeeping role and legal/ethical responsibility for the client's welfare, while mentoring is generally a non-evaluative relationship focused on the mentee's broader professional path."

                "Reflection; requiring the practitioner to write 500 words after every session.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonance refers to the somatic and emotional attunement between supervisor and practitioner, allowing the supervisor to 'feel' the dynamics present in the practitioner-client relationship."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "A practitioner reports feeling an overwhelming sense of 'boredom' and 'sleepiness' every time a specific client practices Breath Awareness. According to L3, this is most likely an example of:",

            "explanation": "Somatic countertransference, such as sudden sleepiness, often mirrors the client's internal state (dissociation) or their defense mechanisms against the intimacy of the therapeutic space."

            "options": [
                "Because mentors are legally allowed to prescribe medication.",
                "Because the 'Guru' archetype can lead to spiritual bypassing and the practitioner surrendering their clinical judgment to the mentor.",
                "Because mindfulness practitioners are required to sign a vow of silence.",
                "Because power differentials do not exist in mindfulness-based settings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Guru' archetype can create an unhealthy power dynamic where the mentee stops thinking critically, leading to ethical lapses or spiritual bypassing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal markers like rapid speech and physical bracing indicate the practitioner is dysregulated and unable to provide a safe 'holding environment' for the client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radical Candor is effective in mindfulness supervision because it maintains the 'Empathy' of the S.E.R.E.N.E. Method™ while providing the 'Evaluation' necessary for growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-supervision relies on the reflexive loop—the ability to be both the 'actor' in the session and the 'observer' of one's own clinical performance."
