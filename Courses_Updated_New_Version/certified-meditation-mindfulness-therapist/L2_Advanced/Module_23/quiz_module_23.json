            "question": "In the context of Somatic Resourcing, what is the primary difference between 'Interoceptive Sensibility' and 'Interoceptive Accuracy'?",
            "options": [
                "Sensibility is the objective ability to detect signals, while accuracy is the subjective report of internal states.",
                "Sensibility is the self-reported tendency to focus on internal states, while accuracy is the objective performance on interoceptive tasks.",
                "Sensibility refers to the intensity of emotional response, while accuracy refers to the speed of the Vagal Brake.",
                "There is no difference; both terms describe the capacity to feel the body's 'felt sense'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive sensibility is a subjective measure (how much you think you notice), whereas accuracy is an objective measure of how correctly a client can perceive internal physiological signals like heart rate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Non-dual awareness moves beyond the 'witnessing' (where there is a witness and an object) into a state where the distinction between the observer and the observed disappears."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dorsal states require gentle mobilization and orienting to the environment to safely bring the nervous system back into the Window of Tolerance without triggering sympathetic overwhelm."

            "options": [
                "The repressed traumatic memories that cause physical illness.",
                "The positive traits, talents, and strengths that an individual has disowned or projected onto others.",
                "The final stage of enlightenment where the ego becomes 'golden' or transparent.",
                "The archetypal 'Hero' figure that protects the psyche from the 'Villain' archetype."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Golden Shadow represents the positive potential and virtues that a client may find too intimidating or 'not like them' to claim, leading them to project these qualities onto mentors or idols."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative deconstruction involves looking at the 'story' we tell about ourselves and using archetypal exploration or 'Author' identification to recognize the story as a construct rather than an absolute truth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity and LTP require consistent repetition, the 'HEAL' process (Hanson), and focused attention to turn passing mental states into lasting neural traits."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical sequencing must always begin with stabilization (safety/resourcing) before moving into deeper processing or inquiry to ensure the client remains within their Window of Tolerance."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "explanation": "Coherent breathing at a rate of 5.5 to 6 breaths per minute (roughly 5.5 seconds in and 5.5 seconds out) creates resonance in the cardiovascular system and maximizes HRV."
