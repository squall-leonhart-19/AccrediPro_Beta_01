            "question": "During a trauma-sensitive mindfulness session, a client reports feeling 'floaty' and that the room seems 'unreal.' What is the most appropriate immediate intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to close their eyes and dive deeper into the sensation.",
                "Instruct the client to open their eyes and name five blue objects in the room.",
                "Advise the client to focus intensely on the tip of their nose.",
                "Explain that this is a sign of spiritual awakening and should be embraced."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Derealization and 'floatiness' are signs of dissociation. Grounding techniques, such as opening the eyes and externalizing focus (orienting), are necessary to bring the client back into their Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In the context of Somatic Pain Syndromes (L3), what does the formula 'Pain x Resistance = Suffering' imply for the therapist?",
            "options": [
                "The goal is to eliminate the primary physical pain through meditation.",
                "Suffering can be reduced by lowering the 'Resistance' variable even if the 'Pain' variable remains constant.",
                "Resistance is a necessary biological component of healing.",
                "Pain and Resistance are the same thing and should be treated identically."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Resistance Loop' teaches that while we may not be able to eliminate the physiological sensation (Pain), reducing the psychological 'No' (Resistance) significantly lowers the overall experience of Suffering."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "When working with clients with Personality Disorders (L4), why is 'Radical Acceptance' often introduced after 'Emotional Regulation'?",
            "options": [
                "Radical Acceptance is too easy and should be saved for the end.",
                "Clients must first have the tools to manage the intense emotions that arise when they stop resisting their reality.",
                "Emotional Regulation is only for Cluster A disorders, not Cluster B.",
                "Acceptance is a religious concept that requires prior secular training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prematurely asking a client with emotional dysregulation to 'accept' their pain can feel like invalidation. They need regulation skills first to survive the intensity of the acceptance process."

                "The weight of the past and the narrow path to the future.",
                "The metabolic changes that occur during long-term sobriety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Hungry Ghost' has a massive stomach (insatiable craving) but a needle-thin neck (the inability to actually take in or be nourished by the object of desire)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For the 'numbness' of depression, warmth-based practices like Metta are often more effective than pure observation, as they help gently re-thaw the emotional landscape."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves 'sipping' the difficult experience rather than 'gulping' it, allowing the client to process grief without becoming flooded or retraumatized."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Urge Surfing teaches the client to ride the 'wave' of a craving, observing its rise, peak, and fall without acting on it or trying to suppress it with force."
