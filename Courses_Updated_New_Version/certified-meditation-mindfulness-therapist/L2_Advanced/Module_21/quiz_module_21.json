            "options": [
                "Identifying and reframing cognitive distortions",
                "Establishing physiological baselines and somatic safety",
                "Deepening insight into childhood narratives",
                "Advanced non-dual awareness practices"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic phase is the foundation of the protocol, focusing on mapping the client's physiological baselines (HRV, breath rate) and ensuring they can safely inhabit their body before moving to deeper psychological work."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "Which physiological metric is utilized during the Somatic Intake as a primary indicator of Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose Levels",
                "Peak Expiratory Flow",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Resting Metabolic Rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV is a key clinical metric used to assess the client's ability to transition between sympathetic and parasympathetic states, serving as a baseline for emotional regulation capacity."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "A therapist notices a client frequently 'zones out' or describes feeling 'numb' during breath-focused meditation. According to Lesson 4, this most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "A state of deep meditative absorption (Samadhi)",
                "The 'Embodying' phase is progressing well",
                "Dissociative symptoms indicating the client is outside their Window of Tolerance",
                "A need to increase the duration of silent sitting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Numbness and 'zoning out' are clinical red flags for dissociation. Trauma-sensitive planning requires titrating the practice or moving to grounding (Regulating) exercises when a client leaves their Window of Tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The E & R phase focuses on 'Embodying' the present moment and 'Regulating' the nervous system to help clients manage hyper-arousal and stay within a functional emotional range."

            "id": "q21_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the MAAS is widely used, the FFMQ is the preferred comprehensive tool for treatment planning as it breaks mindfulness down into five distinct, actionable facets."

            "question": "During the 'Insight Phase' (E & N), the therapist helps the client transition from 'Embodying' to 'Narrative Shift.' What is the goal of this shift?",
            "options": [
                "To stop all thinking and achieve a blank mind",
                "To replace all negative thoughts with positive affirmations",
                "To develop cognitive flexibility and 'unstick' the client from maladaptive self-stories",
                "To encourage the client to write a 500-page autobiography"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Narrative Shift (N) focuses on cognitive defusion—helping the client see their thoughts as mental events rather than absolute truths, allowing for a more flexible and adaptive self-narrative."

            "id": "q21_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Weeks 7-9 are the 'Insight' block, where the focus moves from stabilization (S, E, R) to evolving the client's perspective and shifting their internal narrative (E, N)."

            "question": "Case Study: Marcus presents with high 'Observing' scores but very low 'Non-reactivity' scores on his intake. What should be the priority in his treatment plan?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the intensity of his body scan to observe more sensations",
                "Focusing on 'Regulating' (R) interventions like the 4-7-8 breath to manage physiological spikes",
                "Moving immediately to the Narrative Shift phase",
                "Ending treatment because he is already 'mindful' of his sensations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a client can observe sensations but reacts intensely to them (low non-reactivity), they are at risk of overwhelm. The plan must prioritize regulation and stabilization before increasing awareness further."

            "options": [
                "Mild Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
                "Acute Psychosis or Active Suicidal Ideation",
                "Occupational Stress",
                "Lower Back Pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intensive, unguided meditation can exacerbate symptoms of psychosis or lead to dangerous levels of introspection for those with active suicidal ideation. These require specialized clinical stabilization first."
