            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Attention Regulation scale of the MAIA-2 measures the client's ability to sustain and control attention to bodily sensations, which is a core skill in somatic mindfulness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In non-meditators, the 'Observing' facet often correlates with higher psychological symptoms or anxiety, whereas in meditators, it correlates with better psychological health."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High self-reflection without corresponding insight is often associated with rumination and increased anxiety, as the client is thinking about themselves without reaching clear understanding."

            "options": [
                "It is cheaper to administer",
                "It reduces recall bias by capturing data in the client's natural environment",
                "It provides a formal DSM-5 diagnosis",
                "It requires less effort from the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EMA captures 'real-time' data, which avoids the memory distortions and biases that occur when clients try to remember how they felt over the past week."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative attachment refers to the rigid stories clients tell themselves (e.g., 'I am a failure'), which mindfulness helps to deconstruct through decentering."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low Body Trusting scores (viewing the body as 'unsafe' or an 'enemy') are highly prevalent in individuals with trauma histories or chronic, unpredictable health conditions."
