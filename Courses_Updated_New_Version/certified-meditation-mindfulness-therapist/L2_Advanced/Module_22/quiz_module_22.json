                "Encourage the client to 'lean into' the dissociation to find its root cause.",
                "Immediately transition to external grounding techniques and assess the need for clinical referral.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness therapists must recognize the limits of their scope; when a client dissociates, the priority is safety through grounding, followed by an assessment of whether the client's needs exceed the therapist's clinical training."

            "options": [
                "It is required by law in most states to maintain a business license.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing adverse effects like the 'Dark Night' requires validation, a reduction in 'insight' practices, and an increase in grounding and self-compassion (Metta) to stabilize the client."
