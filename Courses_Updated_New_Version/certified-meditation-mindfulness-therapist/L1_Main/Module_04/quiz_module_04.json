            "question": "In the transition from regulation to insight (L1), what is the primary neurobiological reason why 'Samatha' (calming) must precede 'Vipassana' (investigation)?",
            "options": [
                "To increase heart rate variability (HRV) to its maximum limit.",
                "To dampen amygdala reactivity, allowing the prefrontal cortex to engage in higher-order analysis.",
                "To shut down the Default Mode Network (DMN) entirely.",
                "To induce a state of hypnotic suggestibility for the therapist."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insight requires 'top-down' processing from the prefrontal cortex. If the amygdala is hyper-reactive (the 'alarm' is going off), the cognitive resources required for deep inquiry are hijacked by the survival response."

            "question": "Lesson 2 discusses 'The Mechanics of Mental Narratives.' Which phenomenon describes the state where a client cannot distinguish between their thoughts and objective reality?",

                "Narrative Flexibility",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Fusion occurs when a person is 'stuck' in their thoughts, treating them as absolute truths rather than transient mental events. Insight therapy aims to facilitate 'defusion.'"

            "options": [
                "The time it takes for a meditation session to become effective.",
                "The duration of a client's commitment to the therapy process.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Refractory Period is a concept from Paul Ekman; during this time, our processing is filtered through the dominant emotion, making it difficult to access insight until the nervous system settles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "'Why' questions often lead clients into the 'narrative' (the story about the pain), whereas 'What' and 'How' questions lead them into the 'experiential' (the direct observation of the pain)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Layers of the Onion' traces the path from the immediate symptom (anger at a coworker) down through intermediate beliefs to the core belief (e.g., 'I am unworthy')."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Abandonment/Instability schema often leads to 'anticipatory avoidance,' where a client ends a relationship or pushes others away to avoid the perceived inevitable pain of being left."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'First Arrow' is the unavoidable pain of life; the 'Second Arrow' is our reaction to that pain (guilt, shame, resistance), which equanimity and compassion help to neutralize."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Viktor Frankl's concept, central to this module, suggests that mindfulness creates a 'gap' where we can choose a response based on values rather than reacting based on habit."

            "question": "A 2022 study (n=450) referenced in the module regarding 'Implementation Intentions' (L8) found that clients who used 'If-Then' planning with mindfulness were how much more likely to sustain behavioral change?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10% more likely.",
                "No different than the control group.",
                "Nearly 2 to 3 times more likely to follow through compared to insight alone.",
                "Only likely to change if they also took medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insight alone is often insufficient for change. The module emphasizes that 'Implementation Intentions' (If I feel trigger X, then I will perform mindfulness action Y) significantly bridge the 'insight-action gap.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By moving from the physiological symptom (anxiety) to the underlying psychological fear (imposter syndrome/fear of being a fraud), Marcus has successfully engaged in Vertical Inquiry to find a root cause."
