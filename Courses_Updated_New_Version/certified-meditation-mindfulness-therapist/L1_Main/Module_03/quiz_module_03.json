            "question": "According to the physiology of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), which of the following occurs when the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) is dominant?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Vagal Brake' is applied to slow the heart rate.",
                "Blood flow is diverted from the extremities to the digestive organs.",
                "The adrenal glands release cortisol and adrenaline to prepare for action.",
                "The pupils constrict to allow for better close-up focus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a sympathetic state (Fight or Flight), the body releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline to mobilize energy, while non-essential functions like digestion are suppressed."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "The 'Vagal Brake' concept in Polyvagal Theory refers to the ability of the Ventral Vagal complex to:",

                "Increase the production of stomach acid during high-stress events."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagal Brake is the mechanism by which the vagus nerve slows down the heart rate. When we exhale or relax, the brake is applied; when we need mobilization, the brake is lifted."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "When using the 5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Anchoring technique for acute distress, why is the sequence designed to move through multiple senses?",
            "options": [

                "To test the client's memory and cognitive function.",

                "To tire the client out so they fall asleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory anchoring forces the brain to process external data, which re-engages the prefrontal cortex and reduces the 'bottom-up' emotional signaling from the amygdala."

            "id": "q3_4",

                "Lowers blood sugar levels rapidly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 4-7-8 ratio emphasizes a long exhalation and a breath hold, which stimulates the vagus nerve and promotes a deep parasympathetic (calming) response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV means there is a healthy variation in the time intervals between heartbeats, reflecting a nervous system that is flexible and can switch easily between states."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shaking is a biological mechanism seen in mammals to 'shake off' the excess adrenaline and energy trapped in the body after a survival-based stress response."

                "Scents are the only sensory input that bypasses the thalamus and goes directly to the limbic system.",
                "The nose is closer to the brain than the ears or eyes.",
                "Essential oils contain chemicals that enter the bloodstream faster than medication.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The olfactory bulb has a direct connection to the amygdala and hippocampus, making scent the fastest way to influence emotional states and memory."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Regulating Response' phase is about physiological stabilization. Before cognitive work can happen, the client must be within their Window of Tolerance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Box breathing creates 'calm alertness.' It down-regulates the stress response while maintaining the cognitive clarity and focus needed for performance."
