            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' phase focuses on grounding the client in the present moment by gathering objective data about bodily sensations, which serves as the foundation for all subsequent emotional and cognitive work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex is the primary brain region involved in interoceptive awareness, mapping the internal state of the body to create the 'felt sense' of self."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic bracing is a chronic pattern of muscular constriction, often found in the jaw, shoulders, or gut, used by the nervous system to 'brace' against emotional or physical pain."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mental Velocity refers to the 'tempo' of the mind—how fast thoughts are moving and how rapidly the attention jumps from one topic to another."

            "options": [
                "To distract the client from their physical body",
                "To provide a safe, sensation-neutral area of the body to return to if other sensations become overwhelming",
                "To ensure the client stays awake during the session",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A neutral anchor (like the earlobes or the tip of the nose) provides a psychological 'safe harbor' for clients, especially those with trauma, if they encounter intense or distressing sensations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive Sensibility is the subjective component of interoception—how much an individual believes they are aware of their internal bodily signals."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client says, 'My stomach feels like it's tied in knots because I'm a failure.' How should a SERENE therapist respond to guide them back to 'S' (Somatic)?",

                "'Why do you feel like a failure?'",
                "'Let's explore that knot. Is it moving or still? Is it hot or cold?'",
                "'You aren't a failure, you're doing great.'",
                "'Let's move on to the next body part.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapist's role in the 'S' phase is to redirect the client from the 'Story' (being a failure) back to the 'Sensation' (the qualities of the knot) to build somatic literacy."
