            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for the 'body mapping' and interoceptive awareness enhanced during Advanced Somatic Scanning?",
            "options": [
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Insular Cortex",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Corpus Callosum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The insular cortex (insula) is the primary brain region responsible for interoception—the sense of the internal state of the body—and is heavily recruited during somatic scanning."

            "options": [
                "Acceptance is a passive state, while approval is an active state.",
                "Acceptance is acknowledging the reality of the present moment without judgment; approval implies liking or supporting the situation.",
                "Acceptance is only used for physical pain, while approval is used for emotional states.",
                "There is no clinical distinction; they are used interchangeably in mindfulness therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radical acceptance involves acknowledging 'what is' without resistance, but it does not require the therapist or client to approve of, like, or agree with the situation."

            "question": "To maximize Vagal Tone and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) during Precision Regulating, which breathing ratio is most effective for activating the parasympathetic nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 ratio (4-second inhale, 4-second exhale)",
                "2:1 ratio (4-second inhale, 8-second exhale)",
                "1:2 ratio (8-second inhale, 4-second exhale)",
                "Rapid, shallow chest breathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An extended exhalation (such as a 2:1 ratio) stimulates the vagus nerve and increases the 'vagal brake,' which slows the heart rate and promotes physiological regulation."

                "Distract the client from their current emotional distress.",
                "Uncover the underlying core beliefs or 'schemas' beneath a surface-level thought.",
                "Provide the client with a list of positive affirmations to replace negative ones.",
                "Check if the client has been completing their daily meditation homework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vertical inquiry uses a series of Socratic questions to drill down from a specific thought to the deeper, more fundamental beliefs that drive the client's narrative."

                "Defusion seeks to change the content of the thought to be more positive.",
                "Defusion seeks to change the client's relationship to the thought, viewing it as a passing mental event rather than a literal truth.",
                "Defusion is only effective for clients with low-level stress.",
                "Restructuring is a mindfulness technique, while Defusion is a somatic technique."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike restructuring, which attempts to change the content of thoughts, defusion aims to decrease the 'literalness' of thoughts so they have less power over the client's behavior."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-practices are designed to be integrated into high-stress workflows (like healthcare or first responders) and typically last between 30 and 90 seconds to reset the nervous system."

                "Charging too much for a therapy session.",
                "The therapist positioning themselves as an 'enlightened' authority figure rather than a clinical facilitator.",
                "Using a singing bowl at the start of a session.",
                "The therapist sharing their own clinical credentials with the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Guru Syndrome' occurs when a therapist abandons clinical boundaries and assumes a role of spiritual authority, which can lead to client dependency and exploitation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in the S.E.R.E.N.E. Method™ stands for Regulation & Resilience, focusing on the client's ability to stabilize their nervous system before moving into deep inquiry."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "By strengthening the insular cortex, somatic scanning helps clients with Alexithymia better connect their physical sensations to specific emotional states."

            "question": "A client presents with 'Cognitive Fusion,' believing the thought 'I am incompetent' is an absolute truth. Which technique from Lesson 5 is specifically designed to neutralize this narrative?",
            "options": [
                "Repeating the word 'incompetent' rapidly for 30-60 seconds (The Titchener Effect).",
                "Arguing with the client to prove they are actually competent.",
                "Telling the client to 'just stop thinking' that thought.",
                "Visualizing a bright light to 'burn' the thought away."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Rapid repetition (the 'Milk, Milk, Milk' technique) is a classic defusion exercise that strips a word of its symbolic meaning, leaving only the sound of the word."
