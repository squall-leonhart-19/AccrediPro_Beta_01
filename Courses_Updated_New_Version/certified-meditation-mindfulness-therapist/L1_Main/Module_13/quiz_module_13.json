            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Somatic Scanning, which brain region is responsible for 'interoception'—the ability to sense the internal state of the body?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Amygdala",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex is the primary hub for interoceptive awareness, allowing individuals to map internal physiological sensations like heart rate and breath."

                "Suffering = Trauma x Frequency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The formula 'Suffering = Pain x Resistance' demonstrates that while pain is often unavoidable, suffering is the result of resisting that pain."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "During the 'Exploring Insight' phase (Lesson 5), what is the primary purpose of 'Root Trigger' identification?",
            "options": [
                "To assign blame to past childhood figures",
                "To bypass the somatic experience and go straight to logic",
                "To uncover the core belief driving the emotional reactivity",
                "To replace all negative thoughts with positive affirmations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Guided inquiry aims to move beyond surface symptoms to identify the root triggers and core beliefs (e.g., 'I am unsafe') that drive the client's patterns."

            "options": [
                "Repeating the thought 'I am a failure' until it becomes a fact",
                "Labeling the process: 'I am having the thought that I am a failure'",
                "Distracting oneself with exercise whenever a negative thought appears",
                "Writing down the thought and then burning the paper"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive defusion involves creating distance between the self and the thought. Labeling the thought as 'I am having the thought...' helps the client see it as a mental event rather than an absolute truth."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 focuses on 'Embodying Awareness.' According to Hebb’s Law regarding neuroplasticity, what is the mechanism for integration?",
            "options": [
                "Neurons that fire together, wire together",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hebb's Law states that 'neurons that fire together, wire together,' meaning consistent repetition of new mindfulness habits strengthens the neural pathways associated with those behaviors."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In clinical implementation (Lesson 8), why is Somatic Scanning placed BEFORE Exploring Insight in the S.E.R.E.N.E. protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Because physical sensations are less important than thoughts",
                "To ensure the client is physiologically regulated and grounded before attempting cognitive inquiry",
                "To make the session last longer",
                "Because clients prefer talking about their bodies over their feelings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attempting deep cognitive inquiry while a client is in a state of sympathetic arousal is often ineffective; somatic grounding ensures the 'Window of Tolerance' is open for insight."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "To specifically target the Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) during the 'Regulating Response' phase, what breathing ratio is recommended?",
            "options": [
                "Inhale for 6 seconds, Exhale for 2 seconds",
                "Rapid, shallow chest breathing",
                "Inhale for 4 seconds, Exhale for 8 seconds",
                "Holding the breath for as long as possible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lengthening the exhalation relative to the inhalation (e.g., a 1:2 ratio) stimulates the vagus nerve and signals the brain to down-regulate the nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Cognitive Fusion,' believing their anxious thoughts are literal truths that must be acted upon. Which S.E.R.E.N.E. phase provides the specific tools to address this?",
            "options": [
                "Somatic Scanning",
                "Embracing Presence",
                "Neutralizing Narrative",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Neutralizing Narrative phase (Lesson 6) specifically deals with cognitive defusion, helping clients unhook from the 'literal truth' of their internal narratives."
