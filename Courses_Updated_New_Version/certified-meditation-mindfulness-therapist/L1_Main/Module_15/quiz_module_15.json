            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Scanning phase focuses on interoception—the ability to sense internal bodily states—which serves as the foundational anchor for the rest of the SERENE framework."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations stimulate the vagus nerve, which triggers the parasympathetic 'rest and digest' response and increases Heart Rate Variability (HRV)."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "During the 'Exploring Insight' phase (Lesson 5), what is the therapist's primary goal when helping a client identify 'Cognitive Triggers'?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prefixing a thought with 'I am having the thought that...' creates distance between the observer and the thought, a core principle of cognitive defusion."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking involves attaching a new habit (Somatic Scan) to an existing, established habit (brushing teeth) to increase the likelihood of consistency."

                "It is a legal requirement for all meditation therapists",
                "It prevents the client from becoming too bored during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of breaking down difficult emotions or sensations into manageable 'sips' to prevent overwhelming the nervous system and stay within the Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A client presents with high anxiety and 'racing thoughts.' According to the SERENE framework, what should be the first step in the intervention?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SERENE method is sequential; one must first ground in the body (Somatic Scanning) before they can effectively regulate the breath or neutralize the narrative."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "According to the research cited in the module, how does regular practice of the S.E.R.E.N.E. Method™ impact the amygdala-prefrontal cortex relationship?",
            "options": [
                "It increases amygdala reactivity to minor stressors",
                "It weakens the connection between the prefrontal cortex and the body",
                "It strengthens the prefrontal cortex's ability to provide 'top-down' regulation of the amygdala",
                "It has no measurable effect on brain structure or connectivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness practices like the SERENE method strengthen the functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (executive control) and the amygdala (emotional center), allowing for better emotional regulation."
