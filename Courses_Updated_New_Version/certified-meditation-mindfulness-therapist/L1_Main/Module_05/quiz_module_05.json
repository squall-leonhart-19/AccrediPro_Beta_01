            "question": "According to the 'Architecture of Thought' (Lesson 1), which neurological system is primarily responsible for self-referential storytelling and 'mind-wandering'?",
            "options": [
                "The Central Executive Network (CEN)",
                "The Default Mode Network (DMN)",
                "The Salience Network",
                "The Somatosensory Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Default Mode Network (DMN) is the neurological seat of the 'narrative self,' becoming active during rest, mind-wandering, and self-referential processing."

        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of Cognitive Defusion as taught in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "To prove that negative thoughts are factually incorrect",
                "To replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations",
                "To change the relationship with thoughts so they are seen as mental events rather than absolute truths",
                "To suppress the narrative mind so that no thoughts occur during meditation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion aims to create 'space' between the observer and the thought, reducing the thought's influence without necessarily changing its content or frequency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "In the process of 'Deconstructing the Ego' (Lesson 3), what does the 'Self-as-Context' perspective represent?",
            "options": [
                "The collection of labels, roles, and histories we use to define ourselves",
                "The physical body and its various physiological states",
                "The 'observing self' or the consistent space in which all thoughts and experiences arise",
                "The social identity we project to others in professional environments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Self-as-Context is the 'container' or the 'observer'—the part of us that remains constant while thoughts (Self-as-Content) come and go."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "When neutralizing limiting beliefs (Lesson 4), what is a key distinction between a 'Fact' and a 'Narrative'?",
            "options": [
                "Facts are always positive, while narratives are always negative",
                "Facts are objective and verifiable; narratives are subjective interpretations or 'stories' about those facts",
                "Facts are thoughts we believe strongly, while narratives are thoughts we doubt",
                "There is no distinction; in mindfulness therapy, all thoughts are treated as facts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neutralization relies on identifying that a fact (e.g., 'I missed the deadline') is distinct from the narrative (e.g., 'I am a failure')."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Which mindfulness-based defusion technique (Lesson 5) involves repeating a distressing word rapidly for 30-60 seconds until it becomes a mere 'sound'?",
            "options": [
                "Socratic Questioning",
                "Titchener's Repetition (The 'Milk' Technique)",

                "The 'Notice and Name' Protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titchener's Repetition (often called the 'Milk' technique) uses rapid repetition to strip a word of its symbolic meaning, leaving only the raw auditory sensation."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In 'The Language of Neutralization' (Lesson 6), which of the following phrases best demonstrates a 'defused' stance?",
            "options": [
                "'I am incompetent.'",
                "'I shouldn't feel this way.'",
                "'I am having the thought that I am incompetent.'",
                "'I will be successful no matter what.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adding the prefix 'I am having the thought that...' creates linguistic distance, acknowledging the thought as a mental event rather than an identity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, why is 'arguing' with a ruminative narrative often counterproductive?",
            "options": [
                "Because the narrative mind is always right",
                "Because engagement (even through arguing) keeps the Default Mode Network active and reinforces the 'fusion'",
                "Because clients lack the logic to win the argument",
                "Because mindfulness therapists should never use logic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Engaging or 'wrestling' with a thought provides it with more attention and energy, which often strengthens the fusion and prolongs the rumination cycle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "A 2011 meta-analysis on defusion (Levin et al.) indicated that these techniques are effective because they decrease which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The frequency of the thoughts",
                "The believability and 'tug' of the thoughts",
                "The client's IQ",
                "The activity of the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that defusion doesn't necessarily stop thoughts from occurring, but it significantly reduces how 'believable' or distressing those thoughts are."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "What is an example of 'Naming the Story' (Lesson 7), a technique used to neutralize repetitive ruminative themes?",
            "options": [
                "Writing a list of 10 reasons why the story is false",
                "Identifying a recurring theme and mentally saying, 'Ah, here is the \"I'm not enough\" story again'",
                "Changing the name of the client to a fictional character",
                "Refusing to speak about the narrative in therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Naming the story categorizes a complex set of thoughts into a single label, which helps the client recognize the pattern quickly and disengage from its content."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "To integrate neutralized narratives into daily life (Lesson 8), what is the purpose of 'Thanking the Mind'?",
            "options": [
                "To encourage the mind to produce more negative thoughts",
                "To sarcastically mock the ego",
                "To acknowledge the mind's attempt to protect the self (evolutionary bias) while choosing not to follow its advice",
                "To practice gratitude for traumatic events"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'Thanking the mind' is a defusion technique that acknowledges the brain's evolutionary role as a 'threat detector' without buying into the literal truth of its 'warnings.'"
