            "question": "According to the 'State to Trait' neurobiological model discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary shift seen in long-term practitioners regarding the Default Mode Network (DMN)?",
            "options": [
                "Increased activation of the DMN during focused attention tasks",
                "Reduced baseline activity in the DMN and increased functional connectivity with the Prefrontal Cortex",
                "Complete permanent deactivation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)",
                "A shift from parasympathetic dominance to sympathetic dominance in the DMN"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term practice shifts mindfulness from a temporary 'state' to a lasting 'trait' by reducing baseline DMN activity (the 'wandering mind') and strengthening the connection between the DMN and the regulatory Prefrontal Cortex."

                "To signal the end of a formal 45-minute meditation session",
                "To replace formal practice entirely with short bursts of awareness",
                "To utilize routine daily actions (like opening a door) as anchors to return to the present moment",
                "To remind the practitioner to check their heart rate variability (HRV)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transitional cues are informal practice tools that use existing daily habits or environmental triggers to bridge the gap between formal meditation and the 'real world,' fostering embodied awareness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Third Space is the 'gap' between tasks or roles (e.g., leaving work and arriving home). Utilizing this space mindfully prevents 'attention residue' from previous tasks from polluting the next activity."

                "Practiced only when the individual feels a high level of stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking leverages existing neural pathways by 'stacking' a new behavior (mindfulness) onto an old one (e.g., 'After I brush my teeth, I will take three mindful breaths')."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Backdraft is a term used to describe the phenomenon where 'opening the door' to self-compassion and awareness allows previously suppressed pain or trauma to rush out, similar to oxygen fueling a fire."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Temporal cues are rituals tied to specific times. Aligning practice with these cues helps automate the transition into a mindful state by utilizing the body's internal biological clock."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is highlighted as a physiological measure of resilience. What does a 'high' HRV generally indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A state of chronic stress and sympathetic over-arousal",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plateaus are often the result of the 'striving' mind seeking a specific experience. Reframing this as 'neural consolidation' helps the client move into a state of 'being' rather than 'doing.'"
