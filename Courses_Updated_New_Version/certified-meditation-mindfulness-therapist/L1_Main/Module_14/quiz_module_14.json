            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regulating Response focuses on physiological stabilization, using tools like Polyvagal-informed breathwork to move the client back into the Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the science of interoceptive awareness discussed in Lesson 2, which brain region is primarily responsible for processing internal bodily signals and is strengthened through Somatic Scanning?",

                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insula is the primary hub for interoception; research shows that mindfulness-based somatic scanning increases gray matter density and connectivity in this region."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The formula Suffering = Pain × Resistance illustrates that while pain is often unavoidable, suffering is the result of the psychological resistance applied to that pain."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'flat affect,' feeling numb, and experiencing a sense of 'fogginess' or dissociation. According to Polyvagal Theory, which state are they likely inhabiting?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring Insight uses guided inquiry to move beyond the surface-level symptom (e.g., anxiety) to the underlying core belief or narrative driving the distress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the range of physiological arousal where the client can remain present and integrate their experience without flipping into hyper-arousal or hypo-arousal."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that consistent interoceptive training (Somatic Scanning) resulted in a significant increase in which physiological marker of resilience?",

            "question": "If a client begins to experience 'flooding' (overwhelming emotional distress) during an inquiry session, what is the therapist's first ethical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Push through the distress to achieve a breakthrough",
                "Immediately pause the inquiry and use grounding/regulating tools to return to the Window of Tolerance",
                "End the session immediately and refer the client to an emergency room",
                "Ask the client to ignore the feeling and focus on their breath"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount. If a client is flooded, the therapist must pause the 'top-down' inquiry and use 'bottom-up' regulation tools to stabilize the nervous system."
