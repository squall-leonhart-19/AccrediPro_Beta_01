            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' stands for Regulating Response, which focuses on mastering the Autonomic Nervous System to move from a state of dysregulation to the window of tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive Awareness is the sensing, interpreting, and integrating of internal bodily signals, which is the foundational goal of Somatic Scanning."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The formula 'Pain x Resistance = Suffering' teaches that while pain is often unavoidable, suffering is created by the degree of resistance we apply to that pain."

            "question": "A client presents with a racing heart, shallow breathing, and 'tunnel vision.' According to Lesson 4, which branch of the Autonomic Nervous System is currently dominant?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These are classic markers of the Sympathetic Nervous System (fight-or-flight) response, indicating the client is outside their window of tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In a clinical S.E.R.E.N.E. session (Lesson 8), why must 'Regulating Response' occur before 'Exploring Insight'?",
            "options": [
                "Because clients cannot cognitively process insight while in a state of physiological dysregulation",
                "Because the therapist needs to save the hardest work for the end of the session",
                "Because insurance billing requires physiological work to be done first",
                "Because 'Exploring Insight' is only for advanced clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If a client is in a sympathetic 'fight-or-flight' state, the prefrontal cortex is less active. Regulation must occur first to ensure the client is in the 'window of tolerance' for cognitive work."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Which physiological marker, discussed in Lesson 2 and 4, is considered the 'Gold Standard' for measuring Autonomic Nervous System flexibility?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a primary indicator of the body's ability to switch between sympathetic and parasympathetic states, reflecting resilience."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client says, 'I am a failure.' Using the 'Neutralizing Narrative' technique of labeling, how should the therapist encourage the client to rephrase this?",
            "options": [
                "'I am not a failure, I am a success.'",
                "'I am having the thought that I am a failure.'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rephrasing to 'I am having the thought that...' is a classic cognitive defusion technique that helps the client observe the thought rather than be consumed by it."
