                "Rapid upper-chest inhalation with short pauses",
                "Equal ratio breathing (4 seconds in, 4 seconds out)",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prolonging the exhalation relative to the inhalation stimulates the vagus nerve and activates the parasympathetic 'rest and digest' system, which increases HRV."

            "question": "During a Somatic Scanning session (Lesson 2), a client reports a 'tightness in the chest.' Instead of trying to relax the tightness, the therapist asks the client to 'describe the texture, temperature, and boundaries' of the sensation. This is an application of:",
