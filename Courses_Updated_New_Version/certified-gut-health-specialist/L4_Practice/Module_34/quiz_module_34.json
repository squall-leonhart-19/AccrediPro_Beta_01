            "question": "When implementing the 'Core-Plus-Flex' model in a scalable gut health curriculum, what is the primary function of the 'Flex' component?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a standardized 12-week elimination protocol for all members.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Flex' component allows for personalization within a group setting by providing targeted resources for specific conditions (like SIBO or IBD) that not every group member may share."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Normalizing setbacks creates a safe environment where members feel comfortable sharing their struggles, which is essential for collective healing and adherence."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the 'Aggregated MSQ' (Metabolic Screening Questionnaire) is used to track group progress. If a group's mean score drops from 75 to 30 over 8 weeks, what does this statistically signify?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A lower MSQ score indicates fewer or less intense symptoms. A drop from 75 to 30 represents a significant improvement in the group's overall health status."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Comparison Trap' occurs when members feel they should be progressing at the same rate as others. Specialists must reinforce that gut healing timelines are bio-individual."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protecting client health information (PHI) is a legal and ethical requirement; therefore, the platform must be HIPAA-compliant."

            "question": "A Specialist notices a 'churn' (drop-out) rate of 40% during the 'Identify' (Elimination) phase of a group program. What is the most likely operational cause?",
            "options": [
                "The protocol is too easy and members are bored.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High churn during elimination phases usually stems from the difficulty of the protocol. Facilitators must provide 'Small Wins' and high-touch support to maintain engagement."
