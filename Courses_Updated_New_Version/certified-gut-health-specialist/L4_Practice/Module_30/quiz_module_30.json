            "options": [
                "Hourly billing is illegal in most states for non-MDs.",
                "Value-based pricing focuses on the outcome (remission/relief) rather than just the time spent.",
                "It allows the practitioner to work fewer than 5 hours per week total.",
                "High-ticket programs do not require any 1:1 contact with the client."
