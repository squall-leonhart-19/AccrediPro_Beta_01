            "question": "A client presents with stools described as 'sausage-shaped but lumpy' (Bristol Stool Scale Type 2). What does this clinically indicate regarding transit time and hydration?",
            "options": [
                "Ideal transit time with optimal fiber intake",
                "Slow transit time (mild constipation) often due to dehydration or lack of soluble fiber",
                "Rapid transit time indicating malabsorption",
                "Severe constipation requiring immediate medical intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type 2 stools on the Bristol Stool Scale indicate mild constipation, where the stool has remained in the colon long enough for excessive water reabsorption, typically due to slow transit or dehydration."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During a Betaine HCl challenge (650mg capsule), a client reports a 'warm, burning sensation' in the upper abdomen after the very first dose. What is the correct clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The client has severe hypochlorhydria and needs more acid",
                "The client has normal acid levels or a compromised mucosal lining (gastritis)",
                "The client is experiencing a normal reaction to protein digestion",
                "The test is inconclusive and should be repeated with three capsules"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A burning sensation after a low dose of Betaine HCl suggests the client either produces sufficient acid or has a thinned mucosal lining (gastritis/ulcers), making supplemental acid contraindicated."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to the American Gut Project data cited in Lesson 7, what is the minimum number of unique plant species a client should consume weekly to achieve significantly higher microbial diversity?",
            "options": [
                "10 species",
                "20 species",
                "30 species",
                "50 species"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research from the American Gut Project found that individuals who consumed more than 30 different plant types per week had significantly more diverse microbiomes than those who ate 10 or fewer."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client experiences 'balloon-like' bloating in the lower abdomen approximately 90-120 minutes after eating. Which area of the GI tract is most likely the site of fermentation?",
            "options": [
                "The Stomach (Upper GI)",
                "The Duodenum",
                "The Distal Small Intestine or Colon",
                "The Esophagus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bloating that occurs 90+ minutes post-prandial typically indicates that the food has reached the distal small intestine or the colon, where bacteria are fermenting fibers or undigested carbohydrates."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Lesson 6 highlights that the gastrointestinal tract is a major endocrine organ. Approximately how much more melatonin is produced in the gut compared to the pineal gland?",
            "options": [
                "The gut produces half as much",
                "The gut produces an equal amount",
                "The gut produces 100 times more",
                "The gut produces 400 times more"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The gut contains roughly 400 times more melatonin than the pineal gland, where it acts as a critical regulator of motility, inflammation, and mucosal integrity."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When conducting a 'Health History Deep Dive,' why is it critical to identify 'The Great Reset' (a major life event followed by symptom onset)?",
            "options": [
                "To determine if the client is imagining their symptoms",
                "To identify the specific trigger (e.g., food poisoning, antibiotics) that shifted the microbiome into a state of dysbiosis",
                "To satisfy insurance requirements for diagnostic coding",
                "To prove that the client's diet is the only factor in their health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying 'The Great Reset' allows the specialist to pinpoint the moment the microbiome's equilibrium was disrupted, which informs whether the root cause is infectious, pharmaceutical, or stress-related."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Which of the following symptoms is considered a 'Red Flag' requiring immediate referral to a medical doctor rather than nutritional support?",
            "options": [
                "Mild bloating after eating lentils",
                "Occasional Type 3 stools",
                "Unexplained rapid weight loss and blood in the stool",
                "Feeling tired after a high-carbohydrate meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unexplained weight loss and hematochezia (blood in stool) are 'Red Flags' that may indicate serious pathology such as IBD or colorectal cancer and must be evaluated by a physician."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Baking Soda Test' is used as a preliminary screen for stomach acid. If a client does not burp within ____ minutes, it suggests potential hypochlorhydria.",
            "options": [
                "1 minute",
                "2 minutes",
                "3 to 5 minutes",
                "10 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If the reaction between the baking soda and stomach acid doesn't produce enough carbon dioxide to cause a burp within 3-5 minutes, it is a clinical indicator of low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria)."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which lifestyle factor is most likely to disrupt the 'Clock Genes' in the gut, leading to impaired intestinal barrier function (leaky gut)?",
            "options": [
                "Drinking 2 liters of water daily",
                "Erratic sleep patterns and blue light exposure at night",
                "Walking 10,000 steps per day",
                "Eating 30 grams of fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Circadian disruption (Lesson 6) directly affects the gut's 'Clock Genes,' which regulate the expression of tight junction proteins; disruption can lead to increased intestinal permeability."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A client's 'Dietary Baseline' shows a high intake of 'Ultra-Processed Foods' (UPFs). What specific additive in these foods is most strongly linked to the degradation of the protective mucus layer?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Stevia",
                "Emulsifiers (like Carboxymethylcellulose)",
                "Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emulsifiers, common in UPFs, have been shown in clinical research to thin the gut's mucus layer, allowing bacteria to come into closer contact with the epithelial cells and triggering inflammation."
