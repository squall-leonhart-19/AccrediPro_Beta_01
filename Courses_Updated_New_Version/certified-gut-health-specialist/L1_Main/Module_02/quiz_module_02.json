            "question": "In the 'Identify' phase of the specialist protocol, what is the primary distinction between 'Detection' and 'Identification'?",
            "options": [
                "Detection focuses on presence/absence of pathogens, while Identification uncovers the systemic 'why' behind the dysfunction.",
                "Detection is performed by doctors, while Identification is only performed by health coaches.",
                "Detection involves blood work, while Identification only involves symptom tracking.",
                "There is no clinical distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in functional medicine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Detection is the simple observation of a state (e.g., 'you have dysbiosis'), whereas Identification involves synthesizing data to understand the root cause and systemic triggers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methanogens (specifically M. smithii) produce methane gas, which has been shown to inhibit intestinal transit, leading to constipation-dominant symptoms."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When interpreting a stool analysis, 'Alpha Diversity' refers to:",

                "The comparison of the client's microbiome to a healthy reference population.",
                "The specific ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes.",
                "The richness and evenness of microbial species within the client's individual sample.",
                "The presence of 'Keystone' species like Akkermansia muciniphila."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha diversity measures the variety of species within a single sample; high alpha diversity is generally a hallmark of a resilient and healthy gut ecosystem."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fecal Calprotectin levels above 120-150 μg/g indicate significant neutrophilic inflammation, necessitating a referral to rule out Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies have shown that up to 78% of IBS patients test positive for SIBO, suggesting that SIBO is a major contributor to IBS-labeled symptoms."
