            "question": "Which physiological marker is the primary modulator of intestinal permeability by triggering the disassembly of tight junction proteins?",
            "options": ["Occludin", "Zonulin", "Claudin-1", "Desmoglein"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; high levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In the context of Module 3, why is chronic activation of the NF-κB pathway considered a 'barrier to repair'?",
            "options": ["It stimulates the production of butyrate too quickly", "It promotes excessive collagen cross-linking", "It sustains the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that inhibit epithelial cell turnover", "It increases the absorption of L-Glutamine to toxic levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NF-κB is a master pro-inflammatory transcription factor. When chronically active, it maintains a cytokine environment (TNF-α, IL-6) that prevents the intestinal epithelium from entering the regenerative 'repair' phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "What is the recommended target Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio for a Phase 3 Anti-Inflammatory Nutrition Protocol to optimize mucosal healing?",
            "options": ["15:1 to 20:1", "10:1 to 12:1", "Between 2:1 and 4:1", "1:5 (Five times more Omega-3)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A ratio of 2:1 to 4:1 is considered ideal for reducing systemic inflammation and supporting the resolution phase of gut tissue repair, whereas the standard Western diet is often 15:1 or higher."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "L-Glutamine is the 'gold standard' for mucosal repair because it serves as the primary fuel source for which specific cells?",
            "options": ["Hepatocytes", "Enterocytes", "Colonocytes", "Adipocytes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Enterocytes (cells of the small intestine) use L-Glutamine as their preferred metabolic fuel to support rapid cell division and maintain barrier integrity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Which amino acid found in collagen and gelatin is critical for both the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione and the structural stabilization of the gut lining?",
            "options": ["Proline", "Hydroxyproline", "Glycine", "Arginine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycine makes up about one-third of collagen. It is essential for the synthesis of glutathione and helps protect the gastric mucosa against oxidative stress and chemical injury."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), butyrate provides approximately what percentage of the total energy requirements for healthy colonocytes?",
            "options": ["25%", "50%", "70%", "95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred energy source for colonocytes (cells of the large intestine), providing roughly 70% of their total energy needs via mitochondrial beta-oxidation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Which clinical observation best indicates that a client is ready to transition from 'Inflammation Management' to the active 'Tissue Repair' phase of the G-Protocol?",
            "options": ["A total absence of all gut bacteria", "Stabilization of symptoms and increased tolerance to a wider variety of low-inflammatory foods", "A 10lb weight loss within the first week", "The presence of high levels of fecal calprotectin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Healing Window' opens when acute inflammation subsides, evidenced by symptomatic stability and the ability to tolerate diverse nutrient-dense foods without flares."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In a healthy colon, the three primary SCFAs (Acetate, Propionate, and Butyrate) are typically produced by fermentation in which molar ratio?",
            "options": ["10:10:80", "60:20:20", "33:33:33", "80:10:10"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The physiological molar ratio of SCFAs in the colonic lumen is approximately 60% Acetate, 20% Propionate, and 20% Butyrate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When designing a Phase 3 (G) Protocol for a client with active SIBO, why might you delay the introduction of high-dose prebiotic fibers like Inulin?",
            "options": ["Inulin is toxic to the intestinal lining", "Rapid fermentation by overgrown bacteria can cause severe bloating and pain, stalling the healing process", "Inulin prevents the absorption of L-Glutamine", "Prebiotics only work in the stomach, not the small intestine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In SIBO, bacteria in the small intestine ferment prebiotics prematurely, causing gas and distension that can physically stress the delicate mucosal lining during the healing phase."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'leaky gut' and significant joint stiffness. Which therapeutic nutrient combination would be most effective for addressing both the intestinal basement membrane and connective tissue repair?",
            "options": ["High-dose Vitamin C and Magnesium Oxide", "Type II Collagen, Glucosamine, and Gelatin", "Psyllium husk and Apple Pectin", "Iron and Vitamin B12"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type II collagen and gelatin provide the specific amino acid profile (glycine, proline, hydroxyproline) and glycosaminoglycans necessary for both the structural repair of the gut's basement membrane and joint cartilage."
