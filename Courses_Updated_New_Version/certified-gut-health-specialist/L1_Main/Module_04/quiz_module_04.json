            "question": "Which metric of microbial diversity specifically measures the number of different species and their relative abundance (evenness) within a single individual's sample?",
            "options": [
                "Beta-diversity",
                "Alpha-diversity",
                "Gamma-diversity",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha-diversity refers to the diversity within a single ecosystem or sample, accounting for both richness (number of species) and evenness (distribution of those species)."

            "question": "When reading a probiotic label, which part of the name 'Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG' identifies the specific strain?",
            "options": [
                "Lactobacillus",
                "rhamnosus",
                "GG",
                "L. rhamnosus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In probiotic taxonomy, 'Lactobacillus' is the genus, 'rhamnosus' is the species, and 'GG' is the specific strain designation which identifies its unique clinical characteristics."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Why are spore-based probiotics (such as Bacillus coagulans) often preferred for clients with severe gastric acidity or those requiring shelf-stable supplements?",
            "options": [
                "They are derived from human breast milk and are more natural.",
                "They produce endospores that protect the bacteria from heat, light, and stomach acid.",
                "They are the only probiotics that can colonize the small intestine permanently.",
                "They contain prebiotic fibers within their cell walls."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spore-based probiotics form a protective endospore, allowing them to remain dormant and survive the harsh environment of the stomach and upper GI tract until they reach the colon."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "According to the ISAPP definition, which of the following is a mandatory criterion for a substance to be classified as a 'prebiotic'?",
            "options": [
                "It must be a type of soluble fiber found in grains.",
                "It must be digestible by human enzymes in the small intestine.",
                "It must be selectively fermented by beneficial host microorganisms.",
                "It must contain at least 5 grams of fiber per serving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A prebiotic must be resistant to host digestion and be 'selectively' fermented, meaning it specifically feeds beneficial bacteria rather than all microbes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A client is advised to eat 'cooked and cooled' potatoes to increase their intake of Resistant Starch (RS). Which specific type of RS are they consuming?",

                "RS1 (Physically inaccessible)",
                "RS2 (Granular amylose)",
                "RS3 (Retrograded starch)",
                "RS4 (Chemically modified)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RS3, or retrograded starch, is formed when starchy foods are cooked and then cooled, which changes the crystalline structure and makes it resistant to digestion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "The 2021 study by Wastyk et al. (Stanford University) found that a diet high in fermented foods (6 servings/day) led to which clinical outcome?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in microbial diversity due to competition.",
                "An increase in microbial diversity and a decrease in 19 inflammatory markers.",
                "Significant weight loss but no change in gut markers.",
                "Increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut) due to high acidity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stanford study demonstrated that high fermented food intake increased alpha-diversity and significantly lowered markers of systemic inflammation, including IL-6."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A 2-3 day (48-72 hour) window is recommended to allow for delayed immune or fermentative reactions before introducing another variable."

                "Akkermansia muciniphila"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Saccharomyces boulardii is a yeast, not a bacteria; therefore, it is naturally resistant to antibiotics and is highly effective at maintaining gut balance during antibiotic therapy."
