            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total immune cells are located within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "40-50%",

                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The GALT is the largest component of the immune system, containing approximately 70-80% of the body's immune cells, making the gut the primary interface between the host and the environment."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which Secretory IgA (sIgA) protects the intestinal mucosa?",
            "options": [
                "Direct lysis of bacterial cell walls through oxidative stress",
                "Immune exclusion by binding to pathogens and preventing their attachment to epithelial cells",
                "Inducing systemic inflammation to recruit neutrophils to the lumen",
                "Stimulating the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "sIgA functions through 'immune exclusion,' where it binds to bacteria, toxins, and viruses in the lumen, preventing them from adhering to and penetrating the intestinal epithelial layer."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Old Friends' Theory, why has the incidence of autoimmune and allergic diseases increased in industrialized nations?",
            "options": [
                "The excessive consumption of fermented foods has overstimulated the immune system",
                "The loss of ancestral microbes, such as helminths and commensal bacteria, has led to immune dysregulation",
                "Modern diets contain too many lectins which cause direct DNA damage to T-cells",
                "Increased exposure to pollen and natural allergens has overwhelmed the GALT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Old Friends' Theory posits that humans co-evolved with certain microbes and parasites (helminths) that play a vital role in 'training' the immune system; their absence in modern hygienic environments leads to an overreactive immune response."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which mechanism describes the process where the immune system attacks host tissues because they share structural similarities with a foreign antigen (like gluten or a virus)?",
            "options": [
                "Bystander Activation",
                "Epitope Spreading",

                "Autophagy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the amino acid sequence of a foreign antigen is similar to self-antigens, causing the immune system to cross-react and attack the body's own tissues."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "In the context of the Gut-Thyroid Axis, why is Celiac Disease frequently co-diagnosed with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis?",
            "options": [
                "Because the thyroid gland produces digestive enzymes for gluten",
                "Due to shared genetic susceptibility (HLA-DQ2/DQ8) and intestinal permeability leading to molecular mimicry",
                "Because iodine is primarily absorbed through the large intestine",
                "Hashimoto's is caused by a lack of dietary fiber, which also causes Celiac Disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Celiac and Hashimoto's share genetic markers and a common pathway where increased intestinal permeability allows for immune triggers to cause systemic cross-reactivity against thyroid tissue."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "How do Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), particularly Butyrate, influence immune tolerance?",
            "options": [
                "By inhibiting the production of all white blood cells",
                "By promoting the differentiation of Regulatory T cells (Tregs) via HDAC inhibition",
                "By increasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha",
                "By decreasing the thickness of the protective mucus layer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate acts as an epigenetic modulator that inhibits histone deacetylases (HDACs), which promotes the expansion of Treg cells, essential for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity."

            "options": [
                "A robust and overactive immune response",
                "Chronic stress or long-term immune exhaustion resulting in weakened mucosal defense",

                "Excessive intake of Vitamin A and Zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low sIgA levels typically reflect a depleted mucosal immune system, often caused by chronic stress, malnutrition, or chronic infections, leaving the client more susceptible to 'leaky gut' and pathogens."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Which nutrient is considered essential for the 'sealing' of the intestinal barrier and the modulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses in autoimmune protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D",
                "Iron",
                "Calcium",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D is a potent immune modulator that enhances the expression of tight junction proteins (like zonulin and occludin) and helps maintain the balance between Th1/Th17 and Treg cells."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "In advanced nutritional protocols for autoimmunity, which food group is excluded during the 'Elimination Phase' of the AIP due to its potential to increase intestinal permeability via glycoalkaloids?",
            "options": [
                "Cruciferous vegetables",
                "Nightshades (e.g., tomatoes, peppers, potatoes)",
                "Red meat",
                "Fermented foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nightshades contain glycoalkaloids (like solanine) and lectins that can irritate the intestinal lining and stimulate the immune system in sensitive individuals with autoimmune conditions."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A 35-year-old female with Hashimoto's and IBS reports that her symptoms flare after high-stress weeks. Which physiological connection best explains this?",
            "options": [
                "Stress increases sIgA production, which attacks the thyroid",
                "Cortisol inhibits the secretion of sIgA and increases intestinal permeability, allowing triggers to enter the bloodstream",
                "Stress causes the thyroid to migrate to the gut",
                "Stress increases stomach acid, which destroys the gut's immune cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HPA axis (stress response) directly impacts gut health; chronic cortisol elevation suppresses sIgA and weakens tight junctions, leading to the translocation of antigens that can flare autoimmune thyroiditis."
