            "question": "The Vagus Nerve (Cranial Nerve X) is a bidirectional pathway. What percentage of its fibers are 'afferent,' meaning they carry information from the gut up to the brain?",
            "options": ["Approximately 20%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 80%", "Approximately 95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus Nerve is primarily a sensory nerve, with roughly 80% of its fibers being afferent (sensing the gut environment and reporting to the brain), while only 20% are efferent (carrying commands from the brain to the gut)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which phase of the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is known as the 'housekeeping wave,' characterized by intense electrical activity and strong contractions that clear undigested food and bacteria?",
            "options": ["Phase I", "Phase II", "Phase III", "Phase IV"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III is the most active phase of the MMC, occurring every 90-120 minutes during fasting. It involves powerful contractions that sweep the small intestine clean, preventing bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Cephalic Phase' of digestion is triggered by the sight, smell, or thought of food. Approximately what percentage of total gastric acid secretion occurs during this phase, before food even reaches the stomach?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "30-40%", "60-70%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the Cephalic Phase accounts for 30-40% of the total gastric acid secretion, highlighting the critical importance of mindful eating and sensory engagement for optimal digestion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "In the context of stress and intestinal permeability, chronic elevations in cortisol have been shown to increase the release of which protein that disassembles tight junctions?",
            "options": ["Occludin", "Zonulin", "Claudin", "Mucin-2"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol triggers the release of Zonulin, a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the digestive tract wall, leading to 'leaky gut' or intestinal permeability."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "A client presents with low Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Based on the science of Vagal Tone Optimization, which of the following interventions is most likely to improve their HRV and parasympathetic response?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) late at night", "Restricting calories to under 1,000 per day", "Slow, diaphragmatic breathing at 5-6 breaths per minute", "Increasing caffeine intake to stimulate the nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonant frequency breathing (5-6 breaths per minute) stimulates the Vagus nerve and has been clinically shown to increase Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a key marker of vagal tone and stress resilience."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "How does the frequent consumption of small snacks throughout the day (grazing) impact the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)?",
            "options": ["It strengthens the MMC by providing constant work for the muscles", "It has no effect on the MMC as it only responds to large meals", "It inhibits the MMC, as the cycle only initiates in a fasted state", "It speeds up the MMC cycle from 90 minutes to 30 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MMC is an inter-digestive process that only occurs when the body is in a fasted state. Frequent snacking (grazing) repeatedly resets the cycle, preventing the 'housekeeping' Phase III from occurring and increasing the risk of dysbiosis."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "According to the principles of Circadian Biology and the 'Microbial Clock,' which of the following is true regarding gut bacteria?",
            "options": ["Bacteria are unaffected by light/dark cycles", "Microbial composition and function fluctuate in a rhythmic 24-hour pattern", "The gut microbiome only changes based on what we eat, not when we eat", "Melatonin is toxic to most beneficial probiotic strains"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut microbes exhibit circadian rhythms in both their biogeography (where they are in the gut) and their metabolic activity, which are influenced by the host's sleep-wake and feeding-fasting cycles."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "In the 'Sustain' phase of the protocol, what is the primary purpose of 'Habit Stacking' as defined by the lesson on behavioral change?",
            "options": ["To perform as many new habits as possible at once to see what works", "To replace all old habits with new ones immediately", "To anchor a new healthy behavior to an existing, well-established habit", "To use supplements to 'stack' the effects of a healthy diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking uses the formula 'After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit].' It leverages existing neural pathways to make new behaviors (like taking a probiotic or practicing mindful breathing) more automatic and sustainable."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Chronic stress and the 'Fight or Flight' response divert blood flow away from the digestive organs. This process is known as:",
            "options": ["Postprandial Somnolence", "Splanchnic Hypoperfusion", "Gastric Hyperemia", "Intestinal Angiogenesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Splanchnic hypoperfusion is the reduction in blood flow to the abdominal organs during stress, which can lead to impaired nutrient absorption and damage to the intestinal lining."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "When transitioning a client from the 'Healing Phase' to the 'Maintenance Phase,' what is the recommended approach for long-term dietary flexibility?",
            "options": ["Permanent avoidance of all 'trigger' foods to prevent relapse", "The 80/20 Rule: 80% whole, gut-supportive foods and 20% flexibility", "Monthly 3-day water fasts to 'reset' the system", "Returning to the client's original diet before they started the protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is built on flexibility. The 80/20 rule allows for social enjoyment and psychological well-being while ensuring that the vast majority of dietary choices continue to support the foundational gut health established during the healing phase."
