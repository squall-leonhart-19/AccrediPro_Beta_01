            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "According to dermatological research discussed in Lesson 1, patients with Rosacea are significantly more likely to also present with which digestive condition?",
            "options": ["Celiac Disease", "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)", "Low Stomach Acid (Hypochlorhydria)", "Pancreatic Insufficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown a high prevalence of SIBO in rosacea patients; in many cases, eradicating SIBO leads to a significant improvement or complete resolution of rosacea symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) are unique because they are not digestible by the infant. What is their primary therapeutic purpose in pediatric gut health?",
            "options": ["To provide a direct source of glucose for brain development", "To act as a selective prebiotic for Bifidobacterium infantis", "To thicken the stomach lining to prevent reflux", "To neutralize the pH of the small intestine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HMOs serve as a specialized food source for beneficial bacteria, specifically B. infantis, which helps establish the infant microbiome and educate the developing immune system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Aging Microbiome,' the reduction of which mucin-degrading bacterium is most closely linked to 'inflammaging' and a compromised gut barrier?",
            "options": ["Lactobacillus rhamnosus", "Escherichia coli", "Akkermansia muciniphila", "Staphylococcus aureus"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila levels often decline with age. Since this bacterium supports the mucus layer and gut barrier integrity, its loss contributes to systemic inflammation (inflammaging)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to a collection of gut bacteria capable of metabolizing estrogen. How does high beta-glucuronidase activity impact this process?",
            "options": ["It permanently destroys estrogen molecules", "It converts T4 into T3 thyroid hormone", "It deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation", "It prevents estrogen from binding to receptors in the liver"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-glues' estrogen that the liver has marked for excretion, allowing the hormone to be reabsorbed, which can lead to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Glyphosate is often claimed to be safe for humans because humans lack the Shikimate pathway. Why is this claim problematic for gut health?",
            "options": ["Glyphosate is converted into sugar in the gut", "The Shikimate pathway is present in the gut bacteria that support our health", "Glyphosate only affects the stomach, not the intestines", "Humans actually do have the Shikimate pathway in their muscle tissue"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While human cells lack the Shikimate pathway, our gut microbes use it to synthesize essential aromatic amino acids. Glyphosate can thus act as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, causing dysbiosis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which oral pathogen is specifically noted for its ability to translocate to the gut, where it can alter the microbiome and worsen conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis?",
            "options": ["Porphyromonas gingivalis", "Streptococcus mutans", "Lactobacillus reuteri", "Bifidobacterium breve"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "P. gingivalis, a key driver of periodontal disease, can travel to the gut and systemic circulation, driving inflammation and molecular mimicry associated with autoimmune joint issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism behind 'Molecular Mimicry' in gut-driven autoimmunity?",
            "options": ["Bacteria mimicking human cells to hide from the immune system", "The immune system attacking self-tissue because its protein sequence resembles a microbial antigen", "The gut lining turning into scar tissue", "The brain mimicking gut signals during periods of high stress"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system creates antibodies against a pathogen, but those antibodies also attack human tissues that look structurally similar to the pathogen's proteins."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In culinary medicine, why is it recommended to add 'raw mustard seed powder' to cooked broccoli or kale?",
            "options": ["To neutralize the bitter taste of oxalates", "To provide a source of the enzyme myrosinase, which activates sulforaphane", "To increase the sodium content for better mineral absorption", "To prevent the vegetables from losing their green color during cooking"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cooking destroys myrosinase, the enzyme needed to convert glucoraphanin into the therapeutic compound sulforaphane. Adding raw mustard seed (which contains myrosinase) restores this conversion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the conversion of inactive T4 to active T3 thyroid hormone occurs in the gut via the action of intestinal sulfatase?",
            "options": ["5%", "20%", "50%", "85%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Roughly 20% of T4 to T3 conversion happens in the gut, making gut health a critical factor in maintaining optimal thyroid function and metabolic rate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic skin flares and high levels of fecal Zonulin. Based on Lesson 7, what does a high Zonulin level indicate?",
            "options": ["Excessive production of stomach acid", "A robust and healthy mucosal barrier", "Increased intestinal permeability (breakdown of tight junctions)", "A deficiency in digestive enzymes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. High levels indicate the 'gates' are open, leading to increased intestinal permeability or 'leaky gut.'"
