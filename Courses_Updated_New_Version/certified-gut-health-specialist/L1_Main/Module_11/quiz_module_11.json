            "question": "The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) contains approximately 500 million neurons. Which specific plexus is primarily responsible for regulating gastrointestinal secretions and local blood flow?",
            "options": [
                "The Myenteric (Auerbach's) Plexus",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the Myenteric plexus primarily controls GI motility, the Submucosal (Meissner's) plexus is the primary regulator of secretion and local blood flow within the gut wall."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "The Vagus nerve is a bidirectional highway. What is the approximate distribution of afferent (gut-to-brain) versus efferent (brain-to-gut) fibers?",
            "options": [
                "20% afferent / 80% efferent",
                "50% afferent / 50% efferent",
                "80% afferent / 20% efferent",
                "95% afferent / 5% efferent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve is predominantly sensory; roughly 80% of its fibers are afferent, sending constant updates from the gut to the brain, while only 20% are efferent motor fibers."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Chronic 'leaky gut' can lead to neuro-inflammation. Which pro-inflammatory cytokine is most notorious for increasing the permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and activating microglia?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that can compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, leading to systemic-to-central inflammatory signaling."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Research on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) suggests that early life trauma 'programs' the HPA axis. This often results in which physiological state in adulthood?",

                "Total immunity to functional gastrointestinal disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ACEs are strongly correlated with a sensitized HPA axis, meaning the individual stays in a state of 'hyper-vigilance' where even minor stressors trigger a significant physiological stress response."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When implementing a neuro-centric protocol, why is it often recommended to prioritize 'Vagal Priming' before aggressive antimicrobial 'kill' phases?",
            "options": [
                "Because probiotics only work if the Vagus nerve is severed",
                "To ensure adequate motility and bile flow, which prevents 'die-off' (Herxheimer) reactions from stagnating",
                "To lower the pH of the stomach to kill the bacteria naturally",
                "To increase the patient's appetite for the upcoming restricted diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vagal priming ensures that the 'migrating motor complex' (MMC) is active and detoxification pathways are open, allowing the body to clear the metabolic waste of a 'kill' phase effectively."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "What percentage of the body's total serotonin is produced by the enterochromaffin (EC) cells within the gut lining?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vast majority of the body's serotonin (90-95%) is produced in the gut, where it regulates motility, secretion, and visceral sensitivity."

            "question": "A client presents with low Heart Rate Variability (HRV), chronic constipation, and high anxiety. Based on Module 11 principles, which intervention should be the FIRST priority?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose stimulant laxatives",
                "Aggressive SIBO antimicrobial herbs",

                "Elimination of all carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low HRV and chronic constipation suggest a 'freeze' or 'fight/flight' state (low vagal tone). Shifting the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) into a parasympathetic state is the foundational first step for restoring motility."
