            "question": "When transitioning from the 'Repair' phase to the 'Thrive' phase, what is the primary clinical objective?",
            "options": [
                "Strict elimination of all potential allergens to prevent any immune response.",
                "Shifting focus from symptom suppression to dietary diversity and microbiome resilience.",

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Which enzyme, often produced by dysbiotic bacteria, can deconjugate estrogen in the gut and lead to its reabsorption into the bloodstream?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-amylase",
                "Pancreatic lipase",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria (the estrobolome) that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing estrogen to be reabsorbed rather than excreted."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate supports metabolic health by stimulating the release of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and activating PPAR-gamma, which improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The microbiome has its own circadian rhythm. Jet lag disrupts the synchrony between the host's internal clock and the microbiome's rhythmic activities, leading to metabolic and digestive issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammaging is driven in part by age-related dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, which allows Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to enter systemic circulation and trigger chronic low-grade inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced personalization requires a systematic reintroduction (usually every 3 days) to accurately identify bio-individual triggers while the client is in a stable, 'thriving' state."
