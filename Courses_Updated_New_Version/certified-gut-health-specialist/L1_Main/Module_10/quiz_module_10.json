            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which enzyme, produced by certain gut bacteria, is responsible for deconjugating estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-amylase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the primary enzyme of the estrobolome that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, leading to the recirculation of active estrogen and potential estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Metabolic endotoxemia is defined by a 2-3 fold increase in circulating levels of which bacterial component after a high-fat meal?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LPS from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria can cross a leaky gut barrier, triggering systemic inflammation via TLR4 activation, a process known as metabolic endotoxemia."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vast majority of the body's serotonin (90-95%) is produced in the gut, where it regulates motility and communicates with the brain via the vagus nerve."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bifidobacterium infantis is the primary species capable of fully utilizing HMOs, which helps lower intestinal pH and prevents the growth of pathogens in infants."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "In the context of 'Inflammaging,' which change in the geriatric gut microbiota is most commonly associated with increased systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Increased microbial diversity",

                "Decreased intestinal permeability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aging is typically associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a reduction in butyrate-producing species, which weakens the gut barrier and contributes to chronic systemic inflammation (inflammaging)."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "How does the herbicide glyphosate primarily impact the human gut-barrier and microbiome?",
            "options": [
                "It directly kills human intestinal cells upon contact",
                "It inhibits the shikimate pathway in beneficial bacteria, leading to dysbiosis",
                "It increases the production of protective mucin",
                "It has no effect because humans do not have a shikimate pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While humans lack the shikimate pathway, many beneficial gut bacteria rely on it. Glyphosate can cause dysbiosis by inhibiting these bacteria and has been shown to upregulate zonulin, increasing permeability."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In PCOS, addressing the gut-hormone axis involves supporting the clearance of hormones (glucuronidation) and reducing the metabolic endotoxemia (LPS) that drives insulin resistance."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "In the Case Study Masterclass, what was the primary reason for addressing the 'Gut-Barrier' first in a multi-system case?",
            "options": [
                "Because the gut is the largest organ by weight",
                "To stop the 'influx' of systemic triggers like LPS and undigested proteins",
                "Because supplements work better on an empty stomach",
                "To ensure the client loses weight rapidly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the gut barrier is foundational because a 'leaky' gut allows for the constant entry of systemic triggers that drive inflammation across the skin, brain, and endocrine systems."
