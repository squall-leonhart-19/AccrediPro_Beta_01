            "question": "A client presents with low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and chronic digestive sluggishness. Based on Lesson 1, which physiological state does this most likely indicate?",
            "options": [
                "High vagal tone and parasympathetic dominance",
                "Low vagal tone and sympathetic dominance",
                "Excessive acetylcholine production at the enteric level",
                "Optimal communication between the SCN and the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low HRV is a clinical marker of low vagal tone, indicating that the body is stuck in a 'fight or flight' (sympathetic) state, which inhibits the 'rest and digest' functions of the vagus nerve."

            "question": "The landmark 2011 study by Messaoudi et al. demonstrated that a specific psychobiotic combination reduced cortisol and psychological distress. Which two strains were used?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of L. helveticus R0052 and B. longum R0175 is one of the most well-researched psychobiotic pairings for reducing anxiety-like symptoms and lowering systemic cortisol."

            "question": "According to the principles of Chrononutrition (Lesson 3), how does late-night eating primarily disrupt the microbiome?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of melatonin in the gut lining",
                "It forces the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) to reset every 2 hours",
                "It causes a phase-shift in peripheral clocks, leading to microbial dysbiosis and reduced diversity",
                "It eliminates the need for the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eating outside of the natural circadian window causes a 'mismatch' between the master clock (SCN) and peripheral clocks in the gut, which disrupts the rhythmic fluctuations of microbial populations."

                "The Gluconeogenesis pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Glyphosate targets the shikimate pathway, which is used by bacteria, fungi, and plants to synthesize essential amino acids. While humans lack this pathway, our gut bacteria use it, leading to potential dysbiosis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Substance P is a neuropeptide involved in the gut-brain-skin connection; emotional stress triggers its release, which can increase gut permeability and worsen systemic skin conditions like acne or eczema."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HMOs are the third most abundant solid component of breast milk. They are not digested by the infant but specifically nourish B. infantis, which helps program the developing immune system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the maintenance phase, lapses should be treated as learning opportunities. Using motivational interviewing techniques like reflective listening helps the client maintain self-efficacy without shame."
