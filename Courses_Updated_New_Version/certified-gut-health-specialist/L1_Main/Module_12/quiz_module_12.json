            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total immune cells are located within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "30-40%",
                "50-60%",
                "70-80%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The GALT is the largest component of the immune system, housing roughly 70-80% of the body's immune cells, making the gut the primary interface between the environment and systemic immunity."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Which microbial metabolite is primarily responsible for maintaining the skin's acidic pH and reinforcing the antimicrobial barrier via the gut-skin axis?",
            "options": [
                "LPS (Lipopolysaccharides)",
                "SCFAs (Short-Chain Fatty Acids)",
                "Bile Acids",
                "Hydrogen Sulfide"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate and acetate produced in the gut, enter systemic circulation and influence skin physiology by modulating inflammation and maintaining the skin's protective barrier."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "In the context of the Estrobolome, what is the clinical consequence of elevated bacterial β-glucuronidase activity?",
            "options": [
                "Deconjugation and reabsorption of estrogen into circulation",

                "Rapid breakdown of cortisol in the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The enzyme β-glucuronidase breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid (deconjugation), allowing the active estrogen to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than being excreted, potentially leading to estrogen dominance."

                "Akkermansia muciniphila"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila is frequently found in higher concentrations in athletes; it strengthens the mucin layer of the gut and is linked to better glucose metabolism and lower systemic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "During the 'First 1,000 Days' of life, which factor is considered the most significant driver of the initial microbial seeding in an infant?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The mode of delivery is the primary seeding event. Vaginal delivery exposes the infant to maternal vaginal and fecal microbes (Lactobacillus), while C-sections lead to colonization by skin-associated microbes (Staphylococcus)."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "The geriatric phenomenon of 'Inflammaging' is characterized by which specific shift in the gut microbiome?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aging is often associated with reduced microbial diversity and a shift toward a more pro-inflammatory profile, specifically an increase in pathobionts like Proteobacteria and a decrease in beneficial commensals."

        {
            "id": "q12_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phytic acid (phytate), found in grains and legumes, binds to minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium, forming insoluble complexes that the body cannot absorb, thus reducing their bioavailability."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the D.I.G.E.S.T. protocol, 'I' stands for Intestinal Permeability, focusing on the integrity of the tight junctions and the 'leaky gut' status of the client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Systemic LPS (endotoxemia) triggers low-grade inflammation that interferes with insulin receptors, leading to hyperinsulinemia, which stimulates the ovaries to produce excess androgens (hirsutism)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urolithin A is a postbiotic produced when specific gut microbes metabolize ellagitannins. It is highly valued in geriatric and athletic nutrition for its ability to clear damaged mitochondria."
