            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While clinical mastery is necessary, the transition to supervision requires 'meta-competence'—the ability to help practitioners think about their own thinking and facilitate reflective practice."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "During a D.I.G.E.S.T. process audit (Lesson 3), a supervisor finds a practitioner is consistently skipping the 'S' (Support) phase and moving directly to 'T' (Treat). Why is this considered a clinical error?",
            "options": [
                "The 'T' phase is only for medical doctors",
                "Skipping 'Support' (nervous system/lifestyle) often leads to protocol failure due to poor compliance or stress-induced dysbiosis",
                "The 'S' phase is the only phase that requires lab testing",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Support' phase focuses on the nervous system and lifestyle; neglecting this often results in a lack of sustainable results, even if the 'Treat' phase is technically correct."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term, unsupervised antimicrobial use carries risks to the liver and kidneys; pausing and referring for metabolic clearance is the ethical and safe course of action."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
