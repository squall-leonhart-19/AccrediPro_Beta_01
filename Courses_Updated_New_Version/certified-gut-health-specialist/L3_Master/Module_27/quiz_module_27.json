                "It becomes highly diverse to prevent infection",
                "It mimics a 'metabolic syndrome' profile with increased Proteobacteria to support energy storage",
                "It eliminates all Gram-negative bacteria to protect the placenta",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the third trimester, the maternal microbiome shifts toward lower diversity and higher Proteobacteria, which increases insulin resistance to ensure adequate glucose is available for fetal growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first 1,000 days are vital because the developing microbiome is highly responsive to environmental inputs, and its establishment during this time programs the immune system for life."
