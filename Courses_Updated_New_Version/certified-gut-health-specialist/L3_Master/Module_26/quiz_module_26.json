            "question": "In the DIGEST framework architecture, what is the primary clinical objective of the 'G' (Gut-Healing) Phase?",
            "options": [
                "To introduce high-dose multi-strain probiotics for microbiome colonization",
                "To repair mucosal integrity and reduce localized inflammatory markers",
                "To transition the client to a permanent restrictive elimination diet",
                "To focus exclusively on vagal nerve stimulation and stress management"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gut-Healing (G) Phase focuses on structural integrity, specifically the mucosal barrier and intestinal lining, to reduce 'leaky gut' and inflammation before moving into aggressive microbiome restoration."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "When utilizing the 'Detect & Identify' strategies in Lesson 2, which tool is considered the 'gold standard' for tracking systemic symptom burden change over time?",
            "options": [
                "The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS)",
                "The 3-Day Food & Mood Journal",
                "The Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ)",
                "The Basal Body Temperature Log"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MSQ provides a quantified score across multiple organ systems, allowing the specialist to measure the reduction in systemic symptom burden as the DIGEST protocol progresses."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During the 'Establish' (E) Phase, what is the recommended 'Diversity Goal' for plant-based foods to optimize microbiome richness?",
            "options": [
                "At least 10 different plants per month",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (such as the American Gut Project) indicates that individuals consuming 30+ different plant types per week have significantly higher microbiome diversity than those consuming fewer than 10."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Sustain phase focuses on the nervous system and the Vagus nerve's role in governing the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC), which is essential for preventing bacterial overgrowth and ensuring long-term resilience."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "According to the DIGEST timeline, when should the 'Thrive' (T) Phase typically begin?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately after the first 30 days of the protocol",
                "Once the client is 100% symptom-free regardless of diet",
                "When the client has achieved metabolic flexibility and can maintain results with 80/20 lifestyle adherence",
                "Only after a follow-up GI-MAP shows zero dysbiosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Thrive phase is the 'graduation' phase where the client moves from active intervention to maintenance, characterized by resilience and the ability to maintain health using the 80/20 rule."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "What is a primary advantage of the 'Group Delivery' model discussed in Lesson 7 for scaling the DIGEST method?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for more complex, bio-individual lab interpretations for every member",
                "It eliminates the need for any clinical documentation",
                "It leverages social contagion and peer support, which can increase protocol adherence",
                "It is the only way to treat clients with severe autoimmune conditions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Group models provide community support and 'social contagion,' where the success of peers motivates other members, often leading to better adherence to lifestyle changes compared to isolated individual work."

                "Gallbladder Drainage Activity score"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gut Dysfunction Assessment (GDA) is a proprietary or standardized metric used to quantify the severity of digestive-specific symptoms at various milestones in the program."

                "Cravings for sugar and processed carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unexplained weight loss and nocturnal diarrhea/bowel movements are clinical red flags for serious underlying pathology (like IBD or malignancy) and require medical clearance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "During the 'Protocol Design' (L3), why is it critical to 'Remove' before 'Repair'?",
            "options": [
                "Because supplements won't work if the client is still eating gluten",
                "To reduce the total antigenic load and allow the mucosal immune system to downregulate",
                "To ensure the client loses weight before starting the healing phase",
                "Because the law requires an elimination diet for all gut protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Removing triggers (antigens, pathogens, or inflammatory foods) reduces the 'fire' (inflammation), allowing the 'Repair' nutrients to effectively rebuild the mucosal barrier without constant interference."

        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "What is the primary risk of skipping the 'Sustain' (S) Phase and moving directly from 'Establish' to 'Thrive'?",
            "options": [
                "The client will experience immediate weight gain",
                "The microbiome will become too diverse and cause gas",
                "High risk of symptom relapse due to unaddressed HPA-axis dysfunction and stress triggers",
                "The client will forget how to cook healthy meals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Sustain phase integrates the nervous system. Without it, the client may have a healthy gut but remain in a 'fight or flight' state, which eventually degrades gut function and leads to relapse."
