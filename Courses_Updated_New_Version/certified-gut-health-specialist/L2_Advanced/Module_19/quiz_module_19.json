            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the hierarchy of evidence, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs sit at the top (Level 1), as they synthesize data from multiple high-quality studies to provide a definitive conclusion on efficacy."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Evidence-Based Detection,' a Fecal Calprotectin level of 350 μg/g is most statistically indicative of which clinical state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zinc Carnosine is unique because it adheres to gastric erosions and has been shown in clinical trials to stabilize mast cells and promote the migration of epithelial cells to repair the mucosal lining."

                "All strains within the same species (e.g., Lactobacillus acidophilus) have identical clinical effects.",
                "Different strains of the same species can have vastly different functional effects, such as one being anti-inflammatory and another being neutral.",
                "Strains only matter for manufacturing stability, not for human health outcomes.",
                "The FDA requires strain-level identification for all fermented foods."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence shows that probiotic benefits are strain-specific. For example, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 has specific evidence for IBS that other Bifidobacterium strains may not share."

            "options": [
                "It is significantly cheaper and faster to process.",
                "It can identify bacteria down to the strain level and provide functional gene profiling (what the bacteria can do).",
                "It only identifies the genus of the bacteria, making it easier for clients to read.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the fungal microbiome (the mycobiome)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike 16S sequencing which focuses on a specific marker gene, Shotgun Metagenomics sequences all the DNA in a sample, allowing for strain-level identification and functional analysis of metabolic pathways."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated Zonulin is a validated marker for the disassembly of tight junctions, and anti-occludin antibodies suggest the body is reacting to the breakdown of the proteins that maintain the gut barrier."
