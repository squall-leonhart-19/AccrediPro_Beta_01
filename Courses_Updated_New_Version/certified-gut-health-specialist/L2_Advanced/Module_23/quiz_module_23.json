            "question": "When interpreting a Comprehensive Functional Stool Analysis (CFSA), a significantly low level of fecal Secretory IgA (sIgA) in the presence of high commensal overgrowth most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "A robust and healthy immune response to the overgrowth",
                "Immune exhaustion or mucosal barrier depletion",
                "An acute allergic reaction to dietary proteins",
                "Successful eradication of pathogenic species"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low sIgA in the context of dysbiosis suggests that the mucosal immune system is overwhelmed or 'exhausted,' indicating a need for mucosal support rather than just antimicrobial therapy."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "Which of the following agents is considered a 'Phase-2' biofilm disruptor, specifically used for recalcitrant cases involving heavy metal sequestration within the biofilm matrix?",

                "Standard Oregano Oil"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bismuth-Thiol complexes are advanced 'Phase-2' disruptors designed to break down the mineral and metal scaffolding (lead, mercury, iron) that protects mature, recalcitrant biofilms."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), what is the primary biomarker used to clinically track improvements in autonomic nervous system (ANS) tone and gut-brain axis resilience?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV is the gold standard clinical proxy for measuring vagal tone; an increase in HRV typically correlates with improved parasympathetic activity and better Enteric Nervous System (ENS) function."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "A client with a 'Non-Secretor' status (FUT2 SNP) is genetically predisposed to have lower levels of which beneficial keystone species?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FUT2 gene dictates the secretion of ABO blood group antigens into the mucus; non-secretors lack these 'prebiotic' sugars, which often leads to lower levels of bifidobacteria and Akkermansia."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Therapeutic Fasting, what is the minimum duration of a fast typically required to trigger significant macro-autophagy for mucosal restoration in humans?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While metabolic shifts happen earlier, significant cellular autophagy and the associated 'cleaning' of the intestinal lining typically accelerate after the 16-24 hour mark."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Undecylenic acid is a potent fatty acid that prevents the conversion of Candida into its more pathogenic hyphal (branching) form, which is critical for biofilm formation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormesis involves exposing the body to low-level stressors (like phytochemicals) that trigger the body's own internal defense and repair mechanisms, such as Nrf2 activation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Recurrent SIBO is often a motility issue rather than an infection issue; if the MMC (the 'inter-digestive housekeeper') is not functioning, bacteria will continue to translocate back into the small intestine."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "Which SNP is most closely associated with an impaired ability to process histamine, potentially complicating the 'Thrive' phase when fermented foods are reintroduced?",
            "options": [
