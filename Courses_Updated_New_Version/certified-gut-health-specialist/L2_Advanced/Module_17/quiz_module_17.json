        {
            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 1 indicates that SIBO has a high relapse rate if the root cause is not addressed. What is the estimated relapse rate within 9 months for patients with impaired Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) function?",
            "options": ["12%", "28%", "44%", "76%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that without addressing the underlying MMC dysfunction (the 'cleansing wave'), SIBO relapse occurs in approximately 44% of patients within 9 months."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'pseudo-allergic' reactions including flushing, tachycardia, and headaches after consuming aged cheeses and wine. Which enzyme deficiency is most commonly associated with this Histamine Intolerance (HIT)?",
            "options": ["Pancreatic Elastase", "Diamine Oxidase (DAO)", "Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT)", "Cytochrome P450"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DAO is the primary enzyme responsible for breaking down ingested histamine in the extracellular space (the gut); a deficiency leads to the 'histamine bucket' overflowing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, Mycotoxins (such as Ochratoxin A) are described as particularly damaging to the gut. What is their primary mechanism of action regarding intestinal permeability?",
            "options": ["Increasing the production of beneficial SCFAs", "Stimulating the release of Gastrin", "Degrading tight junction proteins like Occludin and Claudin", "Neutralizing stomach acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mycotoxins are potent 'leaky gut' triggers that directly degrade the protein structures (Occludin, Claudin, and ZO-1) that hold the intestinal barrier together."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "When monitoring a client with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) for potential flares, which fecal biomarker is considered the most sensitive for detecting subclinical intestinal inflammation?",
            "options": ["Fecal Fat", "Fecal Calprotectin", "Secretory IgA", "Fecal Elastase"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fecal Calprotectin is a protein released by neutrophils during inflammation and is the 'gold standard' non-invasive marker for tracking IBD activity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "According to the Gut-Skin Axis lesson, which gastric pathogen has a statistically significant correlation with the development of papulopustular Rosacea?",
            "options": ["Helicobacter pylori", "Campylobacter jejuni", "Salmonella enterica", "Staphylococcus aureus"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Eradication of H. pylori has been shown in clinical trials to significantly improve or resolve symptoms of Rosacea in many patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In the context of 'Molecular Mimicry' discussed in Lesson 6, the protein Gliadin (found in gluten) shares structural similarities with which human tissue, potentially triggering an autoimmune attack?",
            "options": ["Myelin sheath", "Thyroid peroxidase/thyroid tissue", "Synovial fluid in joints", "Islet cells in the pancreas"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gliadin shares amino acid sequences with thyroid tissue; in susceptible individuals, the immune system may attack the thyroid after being 'primed' by gluten exposure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 highlights that geriatric clients often suffer from 'Anorexia of Aging' and malnutrition. Which physiological change in the aging gut most directly impairs the absorption of Vitamin B12 and Iron?",
            "options": ["Increased intestinal transit time", "Hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid)", "Hyper-production of bile", "Thickening of the mucosal layer"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypochlorhydria, common in older adults, prevents the cleavage of B12 from protein and the conversion of iron into its absorbable form."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "Using the D.I.G.E.S.T. framework for a multi-system case (Lesson 8), which step involves assessing the 'Inoculation' or the balance of the commensal microbiome?",
            "options": ["The 'D' step", "The 'I' step", "The 'G' step", "The 'S' step"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'I' in D.I.G.E.S.T. stands for Inoculation, focusing on the diversity and balance of the microbiome, including potential dysbiosis or overgrowths."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client with recalcitrant SIBO also presents with joint hypermobility, easy bruising, and POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome). Which underlying root cause should be investigated?",
            "options": ["Celiac Disease", "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)", "Lactose Intolerance", "Diverticulosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "EDS is a connective tissue disorder that frequently causes gut 'floppiness' and MMC dysfunction, leading to chronic, difficult-to-treat SIBO."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "Why is it often necessary to address Mycotoxin illness (Mold) before or alongside SIBO treatment in a complex case?",
            "options": ["Mycotoxins make the breath test inaccurate", "Mycotoxins are immunosuppressive and prevent the body from maintaining a healthy microbial balance", "Mold spores eat the antibiotics used for SIBO", "Mycotoxins turn into histamine in the gut"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mycotoxins suppress the immune system (specifically Secretory IgA and T-cell function), making it nearly impossible to clear SIBO or SIFO until the toxic burden is reduced."
