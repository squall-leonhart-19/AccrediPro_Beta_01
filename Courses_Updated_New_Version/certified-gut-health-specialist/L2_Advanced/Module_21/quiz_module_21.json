            "question": "According to the D.I.G.E.S.T. Framework, what is the primary objective of the 'D' (Detect & De-stress) phase before moving into active microbial clearing?",
            "options": [
                "Eradicating pathogenic biofilms using high-dose proteolytic enzymes",
                "Identifying systemic triggers and reducing the total allostatic load to improve healing capacity",
                "Introducing high-potency multi-strain probiotics to crowd out pathogens",
                "Strict adherence to a zero-fiber elemental diet to starve opportunistic bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'D' phase focuses on assessment and removing obstacles to healing (stress, poor sleep, inflammatory triggers) to ensure the body can handle the subsequent 'Inhibit' and 'Gut Repair' phases."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In Clinical Triage, if a client presents with both SIBO and a severely compromised Migrating Motor Complex (MMC), why is the structural/motility issue prioritized over microbial clearing?",
            "options": [
                "Microbial clearing is impossible without the use of pharmaceutical antibiotics",
                "The MMC only functions when the microbiome is in a state of perfect balance",
                "Addressing dysbiosis without fixing motility often leads to rapid relapse as bacteria migrate back into the small intestine",
                "Motility issues are easier to fix and provide a quick 'win' for client compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 emphasizes that structural and motility issues (the 'plumbing') must be addressed to prevent the 'stagnation' that allows microbial overgrowth to recur immediately after treatment."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When implementing 'Precision Supplementation' for antimicrobials, which strategy is recommended to minimize Jarisch-Herxheimer (die-off) reactions?",
            "options": [
                "Starting at the full therapeutic dose immediately to 'shock' the system",
                "A 'Low and Slow' titration, starting at 25% of the target dose and increasing every 3-5 days",
                "Administering antimicrobials only on an empty stomach with high-dose Vitamin C",
                "Using only one single herb at a time for a minimum of six months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration allows the liver and lymphatic system to process metabolic byproducts of dying microbes, reducing the systemic inflammatory response known as die-off."

                "Introduce 3 new foods every day for 3 weeks",
                "Wait 3 hours after eating a new food to check for immediate anaphylaxis",
                "Introduce one new food in a moderate portion, then wait 3 days to monitor for delayed IgG or symptomatic responses",
                "Eat the new food 3 times a day for 3 days to 'force' the microbiome to adapt"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 3-day window is critical because many gut-related sensitivities (non-IgE) are delayed, occurring 24-72 hours after ingestion."

            "id": "q21_5",

                "Respiratory Rate at rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV measures the variation in time between each heartbeat; higher variability indicates a dominant parasympathetic (vagal) state, which is essential for digestive function."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "During the 'Establish' phase (Lesson 6), which probiotic yeast is specifically highlighted for its ability to increase Secretory IgA (sIgA) and protect the mucosal barrier?",

                "Bacillus coagulans"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Saccharomyces boulardii is a transient yeast that has been shown in clinical trials to significantly boost sIgA, the primary immune defense of the gut lining."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "A client has been on a protocol for 12 weeks with zero symptomatic improvement. According to 'Troubleshooting the Non-Responder,' what is the first 'Pivot Point' to investigate?",

                "The client's lack of willpower and dietary 'cheating'",

                "Switching to a different brand of the same probiotic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-responders often have 'hidden' drivers such as protective biofilms that shield pathogens or systemic issues like mycotoxin illness that keep the immune system in a chronic inflammatory loop."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "What is the '90-minute rule' discussed in the Neuro-Digestive Integration lesson regarding the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)?",
            "options": [
                "It takes 90 minutes to digest a standard meal",
                "The MMC 'cleansing wave' only initiates after approximately 90-120 minutes of fasting between meals",
                "Clients should exercise for 90 minutes daily to stimulate bowel movements",
                "Vagal nerve exercises must be performed for 90 minutes to be effective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MMC is the 'interdigestive' housekeeper of the small intestine. It is inhibited by snacking, requiring clear 3-4 hour windows (and the overnight fast) to function properly."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "In the 'Thrive' phase, what is the primary goal of 'Metabolic Flexibility' in the context of gut health?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to eat only processed sugars without weight gain",
                "The capacity of the microbiome to utilize a wide variety of substrates (fibers/polyphenols) without triggering symptoms",
                "The ability to switch between a ketogenic and high-carb diet every 24 hours",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A resilient gut is one that is 'metabolically flexible,' meaning the microbial community is diverse enough to ferment various fibers and produce beneficial Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) without causing bloat or distress."
