            "question": "In the D.I.G.E.S.T. Method™ synthesis, if a practitioner identifies high fecal calprotectin and low secretory IgA, which two pillars are being primarily addressed?",
            "options": [
                "Digestion and Targeted Support",
                "Inflammation and Enteric Nervous System",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calprotectin is a marker of intestinal inflammation, while Secretory IgA represents the gut's immune 'first line of defense,' both falling under the Inflammation and Gut Microbiome/Immunity pillars of the D.I.G.E.S.T. framework."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that uncouples (deconjugates) estrogen from its 'package,' allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream instead of being excreted."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila lives in and regulates the mucus lining; its presence is associated with a thicker gut barrier and improved glucose metabolism through GLP-1 signaling."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low HRV is a marker of low vagal tone. Improving vagal tone activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which is essential for reducing neuroinflammation and systemic immune activation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxemia) acts as a constant systemic stressor, forcing the HPA axis to remain active to produce cortisol (an anti-inflammatory), eventually leading to HPA axis dysregulation or 'adrenal fatigue' symptoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Certain Gram-negative bacteria like Klebsiella have surface proteins that mimic human tissue (molecular mimicry), which can trigger or worsen autoimmune attacks on the thyroid in susceptible individuals."
