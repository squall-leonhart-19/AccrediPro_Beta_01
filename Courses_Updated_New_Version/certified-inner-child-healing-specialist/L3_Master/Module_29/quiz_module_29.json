            "question": "According to the neurobiology of permanent integration (L1), which brain region shows increased gray matter density and improved 'top-down' regulation after successful inner child integration?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)",

                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is characterized by the Prefrontal Cortex gaining the ability to regulate the emotional impulses of the limbic system, particularly the amygdala."

            "options": [
                "Interoception is about external balance, while proprioception is about internal organs.",
                "Interoception tracks internal sensations (emotions), while proprioception tracks the body's position in space (boundaries).",
                "They are identical terms for the same somatic process.",
                "Proprioception is only used for athletes, not in trauma recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioception helps the integrated adult feel the 'edges' of their physical self, which is critical for establishing somatic boundaries and distinguishing the adult self from the inner child's felt sense."

                "To force the parts to merge into one single personality immediately.",
                "To facilitate a dialogue that moves parts from 'adversarial' to 'collaborative' through Self-leadership.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master integration involves resolving the conflict between polarized parts (e.g., a Perfectionist and a Procrastinator) by helping them trust the 'Self' to lead."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master-level reparenting moves beyond active crisis repair into a consistent state of stewardship, where the adult self maintains a steady, nurturing environment for the inner child daily."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration involves 'honoring the burden' while somaticizing the fact that the ancestor's survival threat is not the client's current reality."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A key sign of relational integration is the 'Gap'—the ability to feel a trigger somatically but remain in the 'Adult Self' to choose a response rather than reacting."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Void' is the space left behind when the survival-based identity (driven by adrenaline and cortisol) collapses, requiring the client to build a new identity based on presence."

            "question": "A client presents with 'ancestral echoes'—feeling a deep sense of 'lack' despite having financial abundance. Which intervention from Module 29 is most appropriate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transgenerational integration involves the ritual and somatic process of acknowledging that the 'lack' belonged to ancestors (e.g., during war or famine) and does not belong in the client's current body."

                "Integration is purely psychological and has no measurable effect on the brain."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies on mindfulness and integration show that reducing DMN activity significantly lowers the 'background noise' of the inner critic, which is a hallmark of successful inner child work."
