            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limbic resonance occurs through mirror neuron systems, allowing the practitioner to somatically 'tune in' to the client's subcortical emotional states."

                "It manages the tasks of daily living and social roles",
                "It is always fully integrated with the adult personality",
                "It holds traumatic memories and remains 'stuck' in defensive survival states",
                "It is the part of the psyche responsible for logical reasoning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In structural dissociation, the EP (Emotional Part) sequestered traumatic energy and defensive responses (fight/flight/freeze), while the ANP (Apparently Normal Part) handles daily life."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rituals create a container for liminality, helping the psyche move from an old state of being (the wounded child) to a new state (the integrated adult)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary dissociation (often seen in C-PTSD) involves one 'Apparently Normal Part' and multiple 'Emotional Parts' that may hold different trauma responses (e.g., one Fight part, one Freeze part)."
