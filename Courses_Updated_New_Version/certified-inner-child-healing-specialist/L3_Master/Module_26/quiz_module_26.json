            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Integration phase (Weeks 5-8) is designed to move beyond intellectual understanding (Discovery) and begin the deep work of somatic integration and emotional processing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High ACE scores (6+) indicate significant developmental trauma, requiring a slower pace and careful titration to ensure the client remains within their window of tolerance."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During a 'Somatic Dialogue Protocol,' the client reports a 'tight, cold knot' in their solar plexus. Which response best facilitates the 'Dialogue' aspect of the protocol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Dialogue treats physical sensations as parts of the self (Internal Family Systems influence), inviting the sensation to communicate its needs directly."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective reframing externalizes the shame from the identity ('I am broken') to the experience/environment ('I experienced a situation...'), facilitating dissolution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Large, sudden changes can trigger the nervous system's resistance to the 'unknown.' Micro-habits bypass the amygdala's threat detection, allowing for sustainable neuroplasticity."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional play in inner child work must be non-competitive and non-goal-oriented to allow the authentic self to emerge without the pressure of the 'Perfectionist' archetype."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Witnessing within a safe group container allows for 'Co-regulation,' where the regulated nervous systems of the group help the individual process deep-seated shame."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healing is not the absence of triggers, but the development of the 'Self-Repair' capacity—the ability to recognize a trigger and return to a regulated state independently."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation (a key somatic technique) involves moving the focus between the area of tension/freeze and a place in the body that feels neutral or 'resourced' to prevent flooding."
