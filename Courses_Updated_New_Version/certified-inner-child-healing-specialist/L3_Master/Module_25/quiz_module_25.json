            "options": ["The Formative (Educational) Pillar", "The Normative (Administrative) Pillar", "The Restorative (Supportive) Pillar", "The Evaluative (Metric) Pillar"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Restorative pillar focuses on the emotional impact of the work on the practitioner, providing a space to process the 'heavy lifting' of inner child trauma."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "A practitioner notices they are feeling uncharacteristically angry at a client's 'critical parent' during a session. According to Lesson 2, this 'Objective Countertransference' is best used as:",
            "options": ["A reason to terminate the client relationship", "Diagnostic data reflecting the client's internal world", "Personal baggage that must be suppressed", "Evidence that the practitioner needs their own inner child healing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Objective countertransference refers to the practitioner's reaction to the client's actual behavior or internal objects, serving as a valuable diagnostic tool."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "During an Advanced Case Conceptualization (L3), what is the primary purpose of the 'Developmental Gap Analysis'?",
            "options": ["To determine the client's IQ versus emotional age", "To identify specific chronological windows where emotional needs went unmet", "To calculate the total number of sessions required for a full recovery", "To map the client's genetic predisposition to anxiety"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developmental Gap Analysis identifies the specific ages where maturation was arrested due to trauma, allowing for targeted reparenting interventions."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Somatic Resonance.' If a practitioner feels a sudden 'hollow' sensation in their stomach while a client is describing a happy memory, this likely indicates:",
            "options": ["The practitioner is hungry and should eat before sessions", "A 'discrepant communication' where the client's inner child feels empty despite the adult's narrative", "The practitioner is experiencing a sympathetic nervous system shutdown", "The client is intentionally lying to the practitioner"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic resonance often picks up on the 'unspoken' or 'discrepant' emotions of the inner child that the adult client's narrative may be masking."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "In Peer Supervision and Group Mentoring (L5), what is the primary risk of the 'Rescuer-Victim-Persecutor' triangle appearing within the group dynamic?",
            "options": ["It increases the speed of case reviews", "It leads to 'Parallel Process,' where the group reenacts the client's trauma patterns", "It ensures all members agree on the treatment plan", "It reduces the cost of professional liability insurance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel process occurs when the dynamics between the client and practitioner are unconsciously recreated within the supervisory or peer group relationship."

            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Ethical Boundaries, what is the 'Parentified Practitioner' trap?",
            "options": ["When a practitioner brings their own children to work", "When a practitioner takes on the literal responsibility for a client's life choices, mimicking a real parent", "When a practitioner charges 'parental rates' for sessions", "When a practitioner only works with clients who have children"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Parentified Practitioner trap occurs when the boundaries of 'symbolic reparenting' are blurred into literal, unhealthy caretaking of the adult client."

            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 cites that approximately what percentage of trauma-focused practitioners will experience 'Vicarious Trauma' symptoms if they do not engage in regular supervision?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "What is the defining characteristic of 'Master Mentorship' (L8) compared to standard clinical supervision?",
            "options": ["A focus on administrative paperwork and billing", "A shift from teaching techniques to facilitating the 'Self-as-Therapist' presence", "The mentor takes over the client's case entirely", "It is only available to practitioners with 30+ years of experience"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Mentorship focuses on the practitioner's internal state, presence, and 'Self' energy rather than just the technical application of tools."

            "question": "When a practitioner experiences 'Somatic Contagion' (L4)—absorbing the client's physical pain—what is the first recommended step for regulation?",
            "options": ["Tell the client to stop talking immediately", "Use 'Grounding and Differentiation' to separate personal sensations from the client's", "Prescribe the client pain medication", "Leave the room until the sensation passes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Differentiation is the key to somatic resonance; the practitioner must recognize the sensation belongs to the 'field' or the client, not themselves."

            "options": ["By critiquing the practitioner's mistakes harshly", "By speaking about the case as if the practitioner is not in the room, using 'I wonder' statements", "By voting on whether the practitioner should keep the client", "By providing a list of 20 new books the practitioner must read"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflecting teams use 'I wonder' statements and non-judgmental observations to offer new perspectives without triggering the practitioner's defenses."
