            "options": [
                "To force the client to stop all maladaptive behaviors immediately",
                "To create a temporary psychological 'container' for overwhelming emotions until the client is stabilized",
                "To confront the hostile protector part about its destructive impact",
                "To analyze the childhood origins of the current crisis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Containment in the RECLAIM protocol focuses on stabilizing the client by providing a safe, temporary boundary for intense emotions, preventing them from flooding the system before the client has the resources to process them."

                "The complete absence of an Apparently Normal Part"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Dissociation, often seen in CPTSD and OSDD, involves one ANP (handling daily life) and multiple EPs (carrying different traumatic memories or defensive responses)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In this modality, ideation is often the function of a 'Protector' or 'Escape Part' that sees death as the only way to end the 'Inner Child's' perceived infinite suffering."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While PTSD focuses on re-experiencing, avoidance, and threat perception, CPTSD adds the DSO triad: difficulty regulating emotions, persistent feelings of worthlessness/shame, and difficulty maintaining relationships."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hostile protectors usually react out of fear. Validating their role in 'saving' the client in the past reduces their need to attack in the present, allowing for negotiation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first step is cognitive recognition ('I am having a flashback') which helps the 'Adult Self' acknowledge that the current feeling of danger is a memory, not a present-day reality."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory grounding (5-4-3-2-1) is highly effective for acute dissociation as it forces the brain to re-engage with the external environment through the five senses."
