            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1's case study on C-PTSD, which symptom is most characteristic of an 'emotional flashback' compared to a standard PTSD flashback?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of vivid, cinematic visual hallucinations of the original trauma",
                "A sudden, intense experience of shame or despair without a clear narrative memory",
                "A complete loss of consciousness followed by amnesia of the event",
                "A physical sensation of pain in the exact location of a past injury"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional flashbacks in C-PTSD often lack a visual component; instead, the individual is 'hijacked' by the intense emotions (shame, fear, hopelessness) felt during the original developmental trauma."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, what is the primary function of the 'Narcissistic Mirror' when used by a caregiver on a scapegoated child?",
            "options": [
                "To reflect the child's true potential and encourage self-esteem",
                "To provide a neutral environment for the child to explore their identity",
                "To project the caregiver's own disowned 'shadow' qualities onto the child",
                "To teach the child empathy by showing them their own reflection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In narcissistic family dynamics, the scapegoated child acts as a 'mirror' reflecting the caregiver's own repressed shame and flaws, which the caregiver cannot accept in themselves."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the case study of High-Functioning Anxiety (Lesson 3), the 'Perfectionist' Inner Child typically views 'doing' as a survival strategy to avoid which core fear?",
            "options": [
                "The fear of physical punishment",
                "The fear of being 'seen' and exposed as fundamentally 'not enough'",
                "The fear of financial instability",
                "The fear of social isolation from peers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For the perfectionist inner child, high achievement is a shield used to prevent others (and themselves) from seeing the perceived 'defectiveness' or 'emptiness' at their core."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses Pre-Verbal Trauma. When conducting a 'Somatic Dialogue' with the Infant Self, what is the practitioner primarily looking for?",
            "options": [
                "The client's ability to describe their birth in chronological detail",
                "Logical explanations for why the client feels anxious in adulthood",
                "Subtle shifts in body temperature, muscle tension, and breath patterns",
                "A list of cognitive distortions the client learned before age two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pre-verbal trauma is stored in the implicit memory and the body. Healing occurs through somatic awareness—noticing the 'language' of the body through sensations and autonomic shifts."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "For the 'Orphaned Inner Child' (Lesson 5), what is the most critical component of the 're-parenting' phase of RECLAIM?",
            "options": [
                "Finding a new legal guardian for the adult client",
                "Establishing an internal 'Eternal Parent' figure that provides consistent existential safety",
                "Confronting the deceased or absent parent through a medium",
                "Ignoring the loss and focusing solely on future goals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Healing the orphaned inner child requires the adult self to develop a stable, internal 'archetypal parent' that can provide the safety and consistency that was lost during the early parental rupture."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 explores 'Ancestral Echoes.' Which concept explains how trauma can be passed down through generations even without direct contact with the ancestor?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)",
                "Epigenetic inheritance and family systems modeling",
                "Spontaneous genetic mutation",
                "The 'Blank Slate' theory of development"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generational wounding is transmitted both through environmental modeling (family systems) and epigenetics, where trauma-induced stress responses can influence gene expression across generations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "When navigating resistance in the RECLAIM process (Lesson 7), how should a practitioner view a 'Protector' part that refuses to let the client access a wounded memory?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign that the client is un-coachable and should be referred out",
                "As an obstacle that must be forcibly broken down using 'tough love'",
                "As a benevolent part that is currently keeping the client from being overwhelmed",
                "As a 'malicious' ego-construct that needs to be deleted"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In RECLAIM, protector parts are honored for their service. Resistance is seen as a protective mechanism that ensures the client's system isn't flooded with more than it can handle at once."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the transition from 'Recovery to Radiance' (Lesson 8), the 'Wonder Child' is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "A child who never experienced any trauma or pain",
                "The innate, uncorrupted essence of the individual that holds creativity and joy",
                "The part of the psyche that is responsible for critical thinking and logic",
                "A manifestation of the 'Perfectionist' part after it has been healed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Wonder Child represents the 'Original Self'—the part of the individual that remains pure, curious, and creative despite the layers of wounding that may have covered it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'unexplained' chronic fatigue and a feeling of 'heaviness' in their chest when they try to speak up. Based on Lesson 4, this is most likely a marker of:",
            "options": [
                "A cognitive refusal to follow the coach's instructions",
                "A pre-verbal somatic imprint of being silenced or neglected as an infant",
                "A simple lack of physical exercise and poor nutrition",
                "A 'Wonder Child' trying to express excitement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic, non-medical somatic sensations (like chest heaviness or 'frozen' fatigue) are often 'body memories' of pre-verbal periods where the infant's needs were not met or their voice was ignored."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "According to the Module 16 case studies, what is the 'Golden Rule' when working with deep-seated ancestral cycles?",
            "options": [
                "The client must forgive their ancestors before they can heal themselves",
                "The client must physically move away from their family to break the cycle",
                "Awareness is 50% of the battle, but somatic integration is the other 50%",
                "Ancestral trauma is permanent and can only be managed, not healed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While cognitive awareness of ancestral patterns is vital, true cycle-breaking requires 'somatic integration'—changing the nervous system's habitual response to those inherited patterns."
