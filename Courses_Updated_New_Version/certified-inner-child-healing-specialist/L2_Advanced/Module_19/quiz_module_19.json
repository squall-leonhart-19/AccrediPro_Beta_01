        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of trauma (Lesson 1), which brain structure is typically found to be hyper-reactive in individuals with unresolved inner child wounds, leading to an exaggerated 'alarm' response?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The amygdala acts as the brain's smoke detector; in trauma survivors, it becomes hyper-sensitized, triggering the fight-flight-freeze response even in the absence of an immediate threat."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "According to the longitudinal evidence in Attachment Theory (Lesson 2), what is the term for adults who experienced insecure childhood attachments but have processed their history to achieve a secure state of mind?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Earned Secure Attachment refers to individuals who, through therapy or self-reflection, have made sense of their difficult childhoods and can now provide secure attachment to others."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "The landmark ACE Study (Lesson 3) demonstrated a 'dose-response' relationship. Individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher were found to have a nearly ____% increased risk of attempted suicide compared to those with a score of 0.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The original ACE study found that individuals with 4 or more ACEs had a 1,220% (rounded to 1,200%) increase in the rate of attempted suicide."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yehuda's research focused on epigenetic markers, specifically how environmental stress changes gene expression (like DNA methylation) related to the HPA axis and cortisol levels."

            "id": "q19_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is the 'newer' myelinated branch of the vagus nerve that facilitates social connection, calmness, and the 'rest and digest' state."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Clinical trials on Imagery Rescripting (Lesson 6) have shown that the primary mechanism for its efficacy in healing inner child wounds is:",
            "options": [
                "Forgetting the original traumatic memory entirely",
                "Physical exercise performed during the visualization",
                "Cognitive restructuring of the 'Adult Self' only",
                "Updating the emotional meaning of the memory by meeting the child's unmet needs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Imagery Rescripting works by 'updating' the memory's emotional charge; by intervening in the visualization to protect the child, the brain processes the event with a new sense of mastery and safety."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) research (Lesson 7) indicates that growth occurs not as a direct result of the trauma, but as a result of:",

                "The 'seismic' struggle to find meaning and reconstruct one's world-view",

                "The passage of at least 20 years since the event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tedeschi and Calhoun emphasize that PTG is the result of the cognitive processing and 'struggle' to rebuild a life that has been shattered by trauma."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "When using the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II) in clinical assessment (Lesson 8), a score above which threshold typically indicates the need for further evaluation for a dissociative disorder?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A score of 30 or higher on the DES-II is generally considered the clinical cutoff where practitioners should investigate significant dissociative symptoms often tied to early childhood trauma."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Neuroimaging studies (Lesson 1) have shown that chronic childhood stress can lead to a measurable reduction in volume in which area of the brain, affecting memory and emotional regulation?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Prolonged exposure to cortisol (the stress hormone) during developmental windows can lead to atrophy or reduced volume in the hippocampus, which is vital for verbal memory and context."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "According to the ACE Study findings (Lesson 3), individuals with 6 or more ACEs had an average life expectancy that was ____ years shorter than those with no ACEs.",
