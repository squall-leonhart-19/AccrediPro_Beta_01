            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "In the context of the neurobiology of synthesis, which neural pathway is primarily strengthened when the 'Adult Self' successfully regulates a triggered 'Inner Child'?",
            "options": [
                "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to amygdala inhibitory pathway",
                "The HPA-axis to adrenal medulla sympathetic pathway",
                "The dorsal raphe nucleus to hippocampus pathway",
                "The occipital lobe to brainstem visual-motor pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is neurobiologically represented by 'top-down' regulation, where the mPFC provides inhibitory input to the amygdala, allowing the adult to soothe emotional reactivity."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "What is the primary hallmark of 'Advanced Reparenting' that distinguishes it from early-stage healing?",
            "options": [
                "The client relies on the practitioner to provide the 'Good Parent' voice",
                "The client has successfully eliminated all 'Protective Parts'",
                "The internalization of the nurturing parent, where the client provides their own consistent safety",
                "The complete erasure of traumatic memories from the childhood period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced reparenting is characterized by the internal synthesis of the nurturing parent, moving the client from external co-regulation to internal self-regulation."

        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Somatic Anchoring, which physiological state is the target for an 'Integrated Self' anchor?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The integrated self is anchored in the Ventral Vagal state, which allows for safety, connection, and the ability to process emotions without becoming overwhelmed."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "When a client experiences 'resistance' during synthesis, how does the practitioner view the 'Protective Part' according to the module's methodology?",
            "options": [
                "As a self-sabotaging mechanism that must be broken down",
                "As a sign that the client is not yet ready for deep healing",
                "As a part with 'positive intent' that is still operating on an outdated safety map",
                "As an ego-defense that should be ignored in favor of the 'Adult Self'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protective parts are viewed as having positive intent—usually the preservation of the system—and must be integrated through validation and negotiation rather than force."

        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "Which concept describes the process where an adult with a history of insecure attachment develops a secure internal state through healing and integration?",

            "explanation": "Earned Secure Attachment occurs when individuals process their past trauma and develop the coherent narrative and emotional regulation characteristic of security."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, reclaiming 'Play' is linked to the production of which neurotrophic factor that supports neuroplasticity?",

                "Cortisol",
                "BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)",

            ],

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sovereignty involves the synthesis of the self such that validation is primarily internal rather than dependent on external approval."

                "Strict adherence to scripts without deviation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The practitioner's presence serves as a regulated anchor (co-regulation), allowing the client's nervous system to find safety and begin its own synthesis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased HRV is a physiological marker of a flexible and resilient nervous system, indicating successful integration and the ability to move fluidly between states."
