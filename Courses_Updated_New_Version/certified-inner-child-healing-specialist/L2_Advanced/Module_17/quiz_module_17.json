            "question": "A client consistently uses psychological jargon to explain their trauma but remains disconnected from any felt emotion. According to Lesson 1, what is the 'Thinking Child' likely doing?",
            "options": [
                "Demonstrating advanced healing and self-awareness",
                "Using intellectualization as a defense mechanism to avoid the 'vulnerability of feeling'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intellectualization is a defense mechanism where the 'Thinking Child' stays in the realm of logic to avoid the overwhelming pain stored in the emotional and somatic body."

                "The client asks for a glass of water",
                "The client exhibits 'glazing over,' loss of time, or a flat affect (dissociation)",
                "The client becomes curious about the origins of their parts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dissociation, characterized by a flat affect or 'checking out,' indicates the client has entered a hypo-arousal state, moving outside their Window of Tolerance."

                "A sudden, intense feeling of smallness, helplessness, or toxic shame without a clear 'why'",
                "The ability to logically reason through the fear in the moment",
                "An immediate physical reaction to a specific smell"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional flashbacks in C-PTSD involve the sudden onset of the 'feeling' state of the original trauma (shame, terror, abandonment) without a corresponding visual memory."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Inner Child work, anger is often a 'Protector' part. Validating its role in keeping the client safe allows the 'Exile' (the vulnerable part) to eventually be reached."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatization occurs when psychological distress is expressed as physical symptoms, often because the inner child lacks the safety or language to express the pain verbally."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Loyalty to the wound is a cultural or generational script where the individual feels that letting go of pain is an act of disloyalty to family members who also suffered."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "During a session, a client becomes stiff, stops blinking, and their voice becomes monotone while discussing a childhood memory. What is the practitioner's first priority?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These are signs of dissociation. The practitioner must prioritize safety and stabilization by grounding the client in the 'here and now' before continuing."

            "question": "A 2021 study cited in the module found that integrating somatic awareness with inner child work increased recovery rates in C-PTSD by what percentage compared to talk-therapy alone?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "Over 40%",
