            "question": "During the Clinical Intake Foundations (L1), what is the primary objective of identifying 'Age-Regressive Triggers'?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the client with a specific personality disorder",
                "To determine the specific chronological age where developmental arrest or trauma most likely occurred",
                "To discourage the client from focusing on past memories",
                "To provide immediate cognitive reframing for adult problems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inner Child intake focuses on identifying the 'point of arrest'—the specific developmental window where the client's emotional responses became stuck due to unmet needs or trauma."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "The ACE-Plus Protocol (L2) expands upon the original CDC-Kaiser ACE Study by specifically adding assessments for which of the following?",

                "Dietary habits and exercise frequency in adulthood",
                "Peer victimization, community violence, and systemic discrimination",
                "Current income levels and career satisfaction",
                "Genetic predispositions to mental health disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ACE-Plus recognizes that trauma isn't limited to the household; community-level stressors and peer dynamics are critical 'Plus' factors in developmental mapping."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In Somatic Markers and Neurobiological Assessment (L3), what does a consistently low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reading typically indicate in an Inner Child context?",
            "options": [
                "A high state of emotional resilience and ego strength",
                "A dominant Parasympathetic 'Rest and Digest' state",

                "A physical fitness level that is above average for the client's age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low HRV is a somatic marker of poor autonomic nervous system flexibility, indicating the client may easily flip into 'Fight, Flight, or Freeze' when Inner Child wounds are triggered."

            "id": "q20_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment is characterized by the 'biological paradox' where the caregiver is both the source of fear and the only source of safety, leading to collapsed relational strategies."

            "id": "q20_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Internal Family Systems-influenced model, 'Managers' run the client's daily life and use proactive strategies like perfectionism to keep vulnerable Inner Child parts (Exiles) suppressed."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "The Inner Child Needs Assessment (ICNA) Framework (L6) identifies four primary domains. Which domain assesses the child's need for 'Self-Efficacy and the freedom to impact their environment'?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Agency & Autonomy domain measures how well the child's need for independence and 'will' was supported during the Toddler and Preschool developmental stages."

            "id": "q20_7",

            "options": [
                "To ensure the client can tolerate the emotional 'heat' of the work without dissociating or becoming destabilized",
                "To determine how much the client should be charged for the certification program",
                "To see if the client is 'smart' enough to understand the concepts",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ego strength is the psychological 'container.' Without sufficient ego strength, deep Inner Child work can lead to re-traumatization or a 'psychotic break' from reality."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in L2 suggests that individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher are approximately how many times more likely to struggle with chronic depression in adulthood?",

                "1.5 times",
                "4.5 times",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that an ACE score of 4+ correlates with a roughly 4.5x increase in the risk of depression, highlighting the importance of the ACE-Plus assessment."

            "options": [
                "How many hours the client sleeps per night",
                "The reduction in frequency and intensity of 'Internal Conflict' between the Adult Self and the Inner Child",
                "The total number of childhood memories the client can successfully recall",
                "The client's ability to never feel angry or sad again"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is defined by 'Internal Cohesion'—where the Adult Self and Inner Child work together harmoniously rather than being in a state of constant internal tug-of-war."

                "A cognitive IQ test",
                "Body Mapping to identify where the 'numbness' resides and the associated neurovegetative state",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Numbness is a somatic marker of dissociation or 'Freeze.' Body Mapping allows the specialist to track the physiological location of the defense before attempting cognitive interventions."
