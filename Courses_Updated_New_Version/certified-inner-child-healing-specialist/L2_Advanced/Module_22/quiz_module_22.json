            "question": "A client begins describing detailed symptoms of clinical depression and mentions a history of self-harm during an Inner Child session. According to the 'Scope of Practice' guidelines (L1), what is the most ethical course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the session but focus only on the Inner Child aspect of the depression.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed mental health professional while clarifying that coaching is not a substitute for clinical treatment.",
                "Diagnose the client with Major Depressive Disorder and adjust the coaching plan accordingly.",
                "Advise the client to stop their medication so the Inner Child work can be 'purer'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inner Child coaching is non-clinical. When a client presents with clinical pathology or self-harm risks, an immediate referral to a licensed therapist or psychiatrist is required to stay within the ethical scope of practice."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "In depth-oriented Inner Child work, why is 'Standard Informed Consent' often considered insufficient (L2)?",
            "options": [
                "Because clients are usually too regressed to understand standard forms.",
                "Because depth work can trigger unexpected emotional abreactions and temporary 'symptom worsening' that must be disclosed upfront.",
                "Because legal regulations require coaches to use 50-page contracts.",
                "Because informed consent is only necessary for licensed clinical psychologists."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Depth-oriented work carries the risk of 'emotional flooding' and temporary destabilization as suppressed memories surface. Ethical consent must explicitly cover these possibilities so the client can make a truly informed choice."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A client begins to view the practitioner as the 'perfect mother' they never had, exhibiting intense idealization. This is an example of (L3):",
            "options": [
                "Negative Transference.",
                "Parental Projection.",
                "Counter-transference.",
                "Systemic Wounding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parental Projection occurs when the client projects the unmet needs and attributes of a primary caregiver onto the practitioner. Managing this ethically is crucial to avoid creating unhealthy dependency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "During a guided imagery exercise, a client suddenly begins shaking, hyperventilating, and weeping uncontrollably. What is the first step in the 'Crisis Protocol' for managing an emotional abreaction (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "Push the client to go deeper into the memory to find the 'root cause'.",
                "Immediately end the session and ask the client to leave so they can calm down alone.",
                "Employ 'Grounding Techniques' to bring the client back to the present moment and their physical surroundings.",
                "Interpret the shaking as a sign of 'energy clearing' and continue the script."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety is the priority during an abreaction. Grounding techniques (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method) help stabilize the client's nervous system and bring them back to the 'here and now' from a regressed state."

        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical risk associated with the 'Reparenting Metaphor' in the practitioner-client relationship (L5)?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the sessions too expensive.",
                "It can lead to 'Infantilization,' where the practitioner inadvertently robs the client of their adult agency.",
                "It is a scientifically proven method with no known risks.",
                "It encourages the client to move out of their parents' house."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'reparenting' is a powerful metaphor for self-care, if the practitioner takes on the 'parent' role too literally, it can create a power imbalance that keeps the client in a regressed, dependent state rather than empowering their 'Healthy Adult' self."

        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "According to the principles of Cultural Humility (L6), how should a practitioner view 'Systemic Wounding'?",
            "options": [
                "As an excuse clients use to avoid doing their inner work.",
                "As irrelevant, because the Inner Child only cares about the biological parents.",
                "As a critical factor where societal oppression (racism, poverty, etc.) acts as a primary source of childhood trauma.",
                "As something that only affects clients from Western cultures."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility requires acknowledging that for many, 'The World' was a primary caregiver. Systemic wounding from marginalization can be just as impactful as familial wounding and must be validated ethically."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "To avoid the 'False Memory' debate and maintain ethical integrity during guided imagery, a practitioner should (L7):",
            "options": [
                "Ask leading questions like, 'Can you see your father hitting you?'",
                "Suggest specific details to help the client fill in 'blanks' in their memory.",
                "Use open-ended prompts that allow the client to generate their own internal imagery without practitioner suggestion.",
                "Tell the client that everything they 'see' in their mind is a 100% historically accurate fact."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical imagery work uses non-directive language. Suggestive or leading questions can inadvertently 'plant' memories, which is a significant ethical violation and can lead to legal complications."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "A 2021 study on practitioner burnout found that 'Compassion Fatigue' is most likely to occur when (L8):",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner sees too many clients in a day.",
                "The practitioner lacks a 'Healthy Adult' self-care routine and experiences 'empathic distress' without boundaries.",
                "The practitioner charges too little for their services.",
                "The practitioner uses too much guided imagery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue (or empathic distress) occurs when practitioners take on the client's pain as their own. Ethical sustainability requires the practitioner to maintain their own emotional boundaries and self-care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Hard Red Flag' that requires a practitioner to terminate the coaching relationship and refer to clinical care (L1/L4)?",
            "options": [
                "The client cries during every session.",
                "The client expresses a desire to stop talking to their mother.",
                "The client reveals active suicidal ideation with a specific plan.",
                "The client forgets to do their 'Inner Child' homework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active suicidal ideation with a plan is a psychiatric emergency. This is outside the scope of coaching and requires immediate referral to emergency services or clinical professionals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "The 'Power Dynamics' lesson (L5) suggests that the practitioner's primary goal is to eventually:",
            "options": [
                "Become the client's best friend.",
                "Make the client dependent on them for all emotional decisions.",
                "Work themselves out of a job by strengthening the client's 'Internal Healthy Adult'.",
                "Ensure the client signs up for a lifetime subscription to coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ultimate ethical goal of Inner Child work is the client's autonomy. The practitioner acts as a temporary scaffold until the client's own 'Healthy Adult' is strong enough to provide the necessary internal parenting."
