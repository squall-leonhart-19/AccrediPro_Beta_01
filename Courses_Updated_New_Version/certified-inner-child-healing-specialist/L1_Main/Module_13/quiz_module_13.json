            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Neurobiological Hijack' is described as a specific interaction between which two brain regions during an Inner Child trigger?",
            "options": [
                "The Hippocampus and the Occipital Lobe",
                "The Amygdala and the Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Cerebellum and the Thalamus",
                "The Basal Ganglia and the Parietal Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During a trigger, the Amygdala (emotional center) bypasses the Prefrontal Cortex (rational center), leading to an emotional reaction that is disproportionate to the current adult reality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the taxonomy in Lesson 3, which core wound is most strongly associated with 'Hyper-Independence' and a refusal to ask for help as a defense mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "The Wound of Betrayal",
                "The Wound of Rejection",
                "The Wound of Neglect",
                "The Wound of Injustice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Wound of Neglect often manifests as hyper-independence because the child learned that their needs would not be met by others, necessitating total self-reliance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'tightness in the solar plexus' and 'shallow breathing' when discussing a work deadline. Based on Lesson 2, what is the first step in decoding this somatic trigger?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive reframing of the work deadline",
                "Interoceptive awareness and naming the sensation without judgment",

                "Analyzing the childhood origin of the deadline stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 emphasizes that decoding begins with somatic interoception—identifying and staying with the physical sensation to allow the nervous system to process the 'stuck' energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 describes the 'Internal Sanctuary' not just as a visualization, but as a tool for neuroplasticity. What is its primary neurological goal?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress all negative memories of the past",
                "To stimulate the sympathetic nervous system for better focus",
                "To strengthen the neural pathways associated with safety and ventral vagal activation",
                "To induce a state of deep sleep for physical recovery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Sanctuary technique is designed to build 'safety pathways' in the brain, moving the client from a state of defense (dorsal/sympathetic) to a state of connection (ventral vagal)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The silenced voice represents the parts of the self that were ignored; it communicates through the body and emotions to signal needs that were never met during the developmental years."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 distinguishes 'Toxic Shame' from 'Healthy Guilt.' What is the defining characteristic of Toxic Shame?",
            "options": [
                "It is a temporary feeling after making a mistake",
                "It encourages the person to apologize and make amends",
                "It is an identity-based belief that 'I am bad' rather than 'I did something bad'",
                "It is only felt by individuals with clinical personality disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Toxic shame is global and internal; it shifts the focus from behavior (guilt) to the core identity (shame), making the individual feel fundamentally flawed."

            "id": "q13_7",

                "To criticize the Inner Child for being too emotional",
                "To provide the structure, limits, and nurturance that were missing in childhood",
                "To find a therapist to take over the healing process",
                "To ignore the past and focus exclusively on the future"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reparenting involves the client's Functional Adult taking responsibility for the 'holding environment,' providing the consistent care and boundaries the child self requires."

                "The total absence of any emotional triggers or pain",
                "Increased spontaneity, creativity, and 'Self-Leadership'",
                "A constant need for external validation from others"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Manifestation of the Authentic Self is characterized by the '8 Cs' of Self-Leadership (from IFS models discussed in L8), including curiosity, calm, and creativity."

            "id": "q13_9",

                "15%",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As noted in the research section of Lesson 7, studies on structural integration and reparenting protocols showed a 34% improvement in self-reported emotional regulation."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "During a session, a client (Case Study: 'Marcus') begins to dissociate when discussing his father. Based on the 'Deep Dive' protocols, what is the most appropriate immediate intervention?",

                "Pushing Marcus to describe the trauma in more detail",

                "Asking the Inner Child to go to the Sanctuary alone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation indicates the client has left the Window of Tolerance. Somatic grounding is required to bring the nervous system back to a state where processing can safely occur."
