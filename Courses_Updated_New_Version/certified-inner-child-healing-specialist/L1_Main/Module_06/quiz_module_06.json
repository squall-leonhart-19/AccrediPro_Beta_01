            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Integration,' what is the primary shift required to move from fragmentation to wholeness?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating the 'wounded' parts of the psyche to make room for the adult",
                "Moving from a state of internal 'dictatorship' to a model of compassionate self-leadership",
                "Focusing exclusively on cognitive reframing of past traumatic events",
                "Ignoring the Inner Child until the Healthy Adult is fully developed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is not about removing parts, but about establishing a compassionate leadership where the Healthy Adult coordinates and cares for all internal parts."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to the Reparenting Model, which characteristic is MOST essential for the 'Healthy Adult' to possess?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to remain perfectly calm and never experience emotion",
                "A strict adherence to rules and discipline to keep the child in line",
                "The capacity for 'Containment'—holding the child's big emotions without becoming overwhelmed",
                "The ability to explain away the child's pain using logic and statistics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Containment is the Healthy Adult's ability to provide a safe psychological space for the Inner Child's emotions without the Adult becoming dysregulated themselves."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "The concept of 'Somatic Bridging' involves 'regulating for two.' What does this specifically mean in a clinical context?",
            "options": [
                "The therapist and the client breathing in unison to achieve resonance",
                "The client's Healthy Adult using its regulated nervous system to co-regulate the Inner Child's dysregulated state",
                "Using two different somatic tools simultaneously to double the effectiveness",
                "Regulating both the physical body and the environment at the same time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Bridging mimics the parent-child co-regulation process, where the Adult's regulated nervous system helps soothe the 'Inner Child's' physiological arousal."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A 2022 study on relational safety found that 'predictability' reduces cortisol levels by 34%. How is this applied in Lesson 4's 'Consistent Reparenting'?",
            "options": [
                "By ensuring the client follows a strict 5:00 AM wake-up routine",
                "By the Healthy Adult providing consistent, predictable responses to the Inner Child's needs",
                "By predicting exactly when a trigger will occur in the future",
                "By only working with the Inner Child on scheduled therapy days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency and predictability build trust (relational safety). When the Inner Child knows how the Healthy Adult will respond, the nervous system can move out of a hyper-vigilant state."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "When working with 'Protective Parts' (Lesson 5), why is it counterproductive to try to 'get rid of' a protector like an Inner Critic?",
            "options": [
                "Protectors are actually the strongest part of the personality",
                "Protectors usually have a 'positive intent' (safety) and will fight harder if attacked",
                "The Inner Critic is actually the same thing as the Healthy Adult",
                "It is impossible to change any part of the internal family system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protectors arise to keep the system safe. Integration involves acknowledging their positive intent and updating their role rather than trying to exile them."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "In the 'Dialogue of Unity,' which technique is used to prevent the Healthy Adult from being 'blended' with a distressed part?",
            "options": [
                "Suppression of the distressed part's voice",
                "Externalization (e.g., placing the part in an empty chair or drawing it)",
                "Forcing the part to apologize for its behavior",
                "Ignoring the part until it stops talking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization creates 'differentiation,' allowing the Healthy Adult to observe and communicate with a part without being overwhelmed or 'blended' by that part's emotions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "A client struggles to set boundaries with their mother, often oscillating between 'people-pleasing' and 'explosive anger.' What does 'Relational Integration' suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The client should cut off all contact with the mother immediately",
                "The client is setting boundaries from 'Protective Parts' rather than the 'Integrated Self'",
                "The client needs to learn more aggressive communication tactics",
                "The client's Healthy Adult is too weak to ever set a boundary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrated boundaries are set from a place of calm self-protection (Healthy Adult), whereas people-pleasing and anger are typical reactive responses from wounded or protective parts."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "What is a primary indicator of 'Readiness for Manifestation' as discussed in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "The client has achieved all of their financial goals",
                "The Inner Child feels safe enough to express desire and play without fear of abandonment or shame",
                "The client no longer experiences any negative emotions",
                "The client has completed at least 50 hours of somatic tracking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Manifestation and external creation require a sense of 'deserve-ability' and safety. When the Inner Child is integrated, they can express desire without the 'Protector' parts sabotaging the process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah experiences a 'shame spiral' after failing a work project. Her 'Inner Critic' is screaming. What is the first step for her 'Healthy Adult'?",
            "options": [
                "Argue with the Inner Critic using logic to prove the failure wasn't that bad",
                "Somatic grounding to stabilize the nervous system and validating the 'Child's' fear of rejection",
                "Punishing the Inner Critic for being so mean",
                "Immediately starting the next project to prove her worth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first step in integration is always regulation and validation. The Healthy Adult must first stabilize the 'somatic' experience before any cognitive work can be effective."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Long-term integration is sustained through 'The Consistency Principle.' Which of the following best exemplifies this?",
            "options": [
                "A 10-minute daily 'check-in' between the Healthy Adult and Inner Child, regardless of how the client feels",
                "Only doing inner child work when a major crisis occurs",
                "Waiting for the therapist to initiate all internal dialogues",
                "Focusing on the Inner Child only when they are being 'good' or quiet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sustained integration requires daily, low-stakes engagement. This builds a 'secure attachment' bond that ensures the Inner Child feels seen and safe at all times, not just during crises."
