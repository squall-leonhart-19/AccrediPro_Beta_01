            "question": "Within the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. framework, what is the primary distinction between the 'Recognize' (R) and 'Explore' (E) phases?",
            "options": [
                "Recognize identifies the current physiological trigger, while Explore maps the historical core wound and unmet need.",
                "Recognize involves somatic breathing, while Explore involves verbal dialogue with the inner child.",
                "Recognize is for adult-state awareness, while Explore is only used for deep hypnotic regression.",
                "There is no distinction; they are used interchangeably to identify emotional flashbacks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Recognize (R) is about identifying the 'now'—the emotional flashback and physiological state—whereas Explore (E) involves 'mapping' the origin, such as the specific core wound (e.g., abandonment) and what the child needed but didn't receive."

            "question": "According to the teachings on emotional flashbacks (Lesson 2), what is a 'hallmark' characteristic that differentiates them from standard PTSD flashbacks?",
            "options": [
                "They always include vivid, high-definition visual imagery of the trauma.",
                "They are primarily 'amygdala hijacks' that lack a visual component, manifesting instead as intense childhood feelings.",
                "They only occur during REM sleep and never during waking hours.",
                "They are characterized by an immediate increase in prefrontal cortex activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As noted in the work of Pete Walker and Lesson 2, emotional flashbacks are often 'visual-less,' consisting of a sudden regression to the terrifying or hopeless emotional states of childhood."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3's mapping of core wounds, which wound is most frequently associated with the development of 'performance-based self-esteem' and chronic perfectionism?",

                "The Abandonment Wound",
                "The Betrayal Wound",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Inadequacy or Shame wound drives the belief that one is 'not enough' as they are, leading the inner child to adopt perfectionism as a survival strategy to earn love through achievement."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "What is the specific purpose of the 'Somatic Bridge' technique introduced in Lesson 4 (Connect)?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from painful emotions by focusing on external sounds.",
                "To use a current physical sensation as a 'conduit' to access the earliest memory associated with that feeling.",
                "To bridge the gap between the practitioner's energy and the client's energy.",
                "To strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor to release stored trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Bridge uses the 'felt sense' in the body (e.g., a knot in the stomach) as a physical anchor to travel back to the original event where that sensation first manifest."

            "question": "During the 'Listen' (L) phase, a client encounters a 'Protector' part that is angry and resistant. What is the most effective clinical intervention according to the framework?",

                "Command the Protector to leave the session so you can talk to the child.",
                "Ignore the Protector and focus only on the vulnerable 'Exile' part.",
                "Validate the Protector’s intent and ask, 'What are you afraid would happen if you stepped back?'",
                "Explain to the client that the Protector is a sign of lack of progress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Lesson 5, we learn that Protectors (like an inner critic or anger) must be honored and understood. Asking about their fears helps them relax and allows access to the inner child."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shame thrives in secrecy and judgment. Compassionate witnessing—affirming that the child's response was a valid survival strategy—dissolves the 'I am bad' identity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation requires the 'Inner Parent' to be in a Ventral Vagal state (calm, connected, and safe) to effectively soothe the inner child's dysregulated nervous system."

                "Cortisol",
                "BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF acts as 'Miracle-Gro' for the brain. Play stimulates BDNF, which facilitates the neuroplasticity required to 're-wire' old trauma patterns into new, healthy identities."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah experiences a 'tight throat' and 'fear of being fired' whenever her boss asks for a meeting. She identifies this as a 6-year-old part of her. Which R.E.C.L.A.I.M. step involves her saying, 'It makes total sense that you feel this way because you were blamed for things you didn't do'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Affirm' step involves validating the child's experience and removing shame by providing the validation that was missing during the original wounding."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'Reparenting Interventions' (referenced in Lesson 7) found that clients who practiced daily 'Self-Soothing' scripts for 8 weeks showed what change in their 'Window of Tolerance'?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% decrease in emotional resilience.",
                "A 40% expansion in the Window of Tolerance, leading to fewer dissociative episodes.",
