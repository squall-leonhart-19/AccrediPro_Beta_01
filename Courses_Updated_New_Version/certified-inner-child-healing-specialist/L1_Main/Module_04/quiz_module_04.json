            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Radical Attunement' is distinguished from standard active listening. What is the core differentiator of Radical Attunement?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner focuses solely on the literal words spoken by the client.",
                "The practitioner achieves a state of emotional and physiological resonance where they 'feel with' rather than just 'hear' the inner child.",
                "The practitioner interrupts frequently to ensure they have understood the timeline of events.",
                "The practitioner uses pre-written scripts to guide the inner child's responses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radical Attunement goes beyond cognitive understanding; it involves physiological resonance and emotional 'with-ness' to create a safe container for the inner child."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic listening treats physical sensations as a form of communication, especially for pre-verbal or repressed memories where the body speaks what the mind cannot yet name."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Symbolic language requires exploration of the client's personal meaning and the 'felt sense' of the imagery rather than external clinical imposition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Silence is not an absence of communication; it is a communication of its own, often signaling a need for safety, a boundary, or the presence of a pre-verbal trauma."
