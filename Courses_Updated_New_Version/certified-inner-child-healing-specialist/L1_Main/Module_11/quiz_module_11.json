            "question": "In Advanced Somatic Integration, what is the primary objective of 'Pendulation' between the Adult and Child nervous systems?",
            "options": [
                "To force the child state to remain in the past while the adult stays in the present",
                "To build the capacity to move between a state of activation and a state of resource/calm",
                "To ensure the client remains in a high-arousal state to process trauma faster",
                "To eliminate the 'Child' nervous system response entirely through logic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation allows the nervous system to 'swing' between a traumatic memory (activation) and a felt sense of safety (resource), preventing flooding and building resilience."

                "An adult manipulation tactic used to avoid taking responsibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spite and rebellion are often 'protest behaviors' from a child self that felt silenced or controlled; acknowledging this power reclamation is key to shadow integration."

            "question": "According to the 'Architecture of Play' (Lesson 3), which neurobiological shift occurs when an adult engages in 'Deep Play'?",
            "options": [
                "Suppression of the prefrontal cortex to allow for pure instinct",
                "Activation of the dorsal vagal complex to induce a freeze state",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Play reduces stress hormones (cortisol) and stimulates Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which supports the growth of new neural pathways."

                "A legal document outlining contact restrictions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal boundaries are set within the self, where the 'Healthy Adult' protects the 'Inner Child' from internal abuse, such as self-criticism or self-neglect."

            "explanation": "The 'Ghost in the Nursery' refers to the unprocessed, repressed trauma of previous generations that 're-appears' in the way parents treat their own children."

            "question": "In Lesson 7's Advanced Visualization, why is the inclusion of 'Olfactory' (smell) cues critical for the Inner Sanctuary?",
            "options": [
                "Smell is the only sense not processed by the thalamus, linking directly to the emotional brain",
                "It is the easiest sense for most clients to visualize without practice",
                "It helps the client stay in the logical 'Adult' brain during the session",
                "Smells are generally more pleasant than visual or auditory cues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Olfactory signals travel directly to the amygdala and hippocampus (the limbic system), making smell a powerful tool for triggering a deep sense of safety and memory."

                "Force the client to cry to break the emotional dam",
                "Acknowledge the 'Protector' part that is creating the numbness and thank it for its service",
                "Stop the sessions until the client is more motivated",
                "Tell the client they are failing at the visualization process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Numbness is a protective mechanism. Sustaining the connection requires honoring the protectors (the parts creating numbness) before the child can safely emerge."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client consistently 'over-shares' and 'over-explains' in relationships. This is a boundary manifestation of which Inner Child wound?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "The conscious decision to follow in a parent's footsteps",
                "An unconscious agreement to suffer or remain limited to stay 'loyal' to the family's trauma history",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
