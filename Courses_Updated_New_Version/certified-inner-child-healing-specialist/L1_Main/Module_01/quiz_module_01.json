                "A physical injury that reminds the client of a past accident"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike PTSD flashbacks which are often visual, emotional flashbacks are 'feeling-state' regressions where the individual feels the same terror or shame they felt as a child, often without a clear visual memory."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In adulthood, the Flight response often manifests as workaholism, perfectionism, and a 'rushed' internal state used to outrun painful underlying emotions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Observing Ego allows the client to move from 'being' the feeling to 'observing' the feeling, which is the foundational step of the Recognize phase."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Freeze response is a dorsal vagal state characterized by immobilization, which often presents somatically as numbness, dissociation, or a 'deadened' feeling in the body."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response is a survival strategy that seeks safety by appeasing others, abandoning one's own needs to stay in the good graces of a perceived 'authority' or partner."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Why is 'Somatic Recognition' considered a 'bottom-up' approach in Inner Child healing?",
            "options": [
                "Because it starts with the feet and moves up to the head",
                "Because it prioritizes physiological sensations and the nervous system before cognitive processing",
                "Because it is only used for children, not adults",
                "Because it focuses on the lowest levels of the family hierarchy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up approaches recognize that the body (nervous system) often reacts before the thinking brain (cortex) can process what is happening."

                "To interpret the symbolism of the client's emotional state",
                "To utilize grounding techniques to bring the client back to the 'Adult Self'",
                "To encourage the client to stay in the pain as long as possible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recognition requires a degree of safety. If a client is flooded, the practitioner must first use grounding to restore the 'Observing Ego' before any further recognition can occur."
