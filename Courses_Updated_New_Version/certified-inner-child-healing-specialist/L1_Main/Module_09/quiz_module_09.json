            "question": "In the architecture of the 'Healthy Adult' self, which psychological capacity is considered the 'Executive Director' of the internal system?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to suppress the Inner Child's emotions",
                "The capacity for non-judgmental observation and compassionate regulation",
                "The strict adherence to external societal rules",
                "The total elimination of the 'Inner Critic' voice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Healthy Adult self is characterized by the capacity to observe internal states without being consumed by them, providing a 'witness' perspective that can compassionately regulate the child parts."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of Somatic Regulation in Lesson 2, what is the 'Window of Tolerance'?",
            "options": [
                "The amount of time a client can spend in a session before getting tired",
                "The specific age range where inner child healing is most effective",
                "The optimal zone of arousal where a person can process emotions without becoming overwhelmed or shut down",
                "The period of time between a trigger and a reactive response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the zone where the nervous system is regulated enough to process information and emotions effectively, neither in hyper-arousal (fight/flight) nor hypo-arousal (freeze)."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the 'Affirm' stage focuses on dissolving core shame. What is the fundamental difference between 'Healthy Guilt' and 'Toxic Shame'?",
            "options": [
                "Guilt is about 'I am bad'; Shame is about 'I did something bad'",
                "Guilt is an emotion; Shame is a physical sensation",
                "Guilt is about behavior ('I did bad'); Shame is about identity ('I am bad')",
                "There is no functional difference in a therapeutic setting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healthy guilt focuses on an action that violated one's values, whereas toxic shame is an internalized belief that one's very self is flawed or unworthy."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "The 'Hero Archetype' (Over-Functioning Child) typically develops as a survival strategy in response to which family dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "A highly structured and supportive environment",
                "Parental emotional instability or neglect where the child takes on adult responsibilities",
                "A family that prioritizes play and creativity over achievement",
                "An only-child dynamic with excessive parental attention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Over-Functioning Child or 'Hero' often arises in chaotic or neglectful environments where the child feels they must be 'perfect' or 'helpful' to ensure family stability or receive crumbs of validation."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "In the 'Internal Safe Harbor' visualization protocol, why is 'Sensory Grounding' prioritized over 'Narrative Detail'?",
            "options": [
                "Because clients have poor imaginations",
                "Because the subcortical brain (limbic system) responds more effectively to felt-sense sensations than abstract stories",
                "Because it takes less time in a coaching session",
                "Because sensory details are easier for the coach to script"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To establish true safety, the nervous system needs a 'felt-sense' of security. Sensory grounding (sights, sounds, textures) bypasses the analytical mind to communicate safety directly to the limbic system."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Generational Loops.' Which of the following best describes the 'Inherited Burden'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inherited burdens are the emotional and psychological patterns—often trauma-based—that are passed down through generations until they are consciously processed and 'broken' by an individual."

            "options": [
                "It burns calories and improves physical health",
                "It increases Ventral Vagal tone and fosters neuroplasticity by signaling safety to the brain",
                "It helps the client forget their childhood trauma",
                "It makes the coaching process feel less like 'work'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Play is a high-level state of the Ventral Vagal system. It allows the brain to reorganize and form new neural pathways (neuroplasticity) in a state of safety and connection."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",

                "Merging the Inner Child's needs with the Healthy Adult's daily actions and boundaries",
                "Ignoring the child part to focus on the future",
                "Ending the relationship with the biological parents",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Integration is the process where the insights gained during healing are translated into the 'Healthy Adult's' daily life through consistent self-care, boundaries, and internal communication."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Hyper-Vigilance' and an inability to relax, even in safe environments. Which somatic intervention from Lesson 2 is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client to think more logically about their safety",
                "Using 'Orienting' exercises to help the nervous system scan the current environment for actual safety",
                "Encouraging a high-intensity workout to 'burn off' the energy",
                "Suggesting they watch a movie to distract themselves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orienting (slowly looking around the room and naming objects) helps the nervous system recognize that the current environment is safe, moving the client out of a sympathetic 'threat' response."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "According to Module 9 data, what percentage of clients with 'Hero Archetype' tendencies also report significant difficulty in setting boundaries with workplace authority figures?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Over 80% in clinical observation due to the 'people-pleasing' survival mechanism",
                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Hero' or Over-Functioning child typically carries a deep-seated need for external validation, which manifests as an inability to set boundaries with authority figures for fear of losing 'status' or safety."
