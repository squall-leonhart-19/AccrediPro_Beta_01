            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Manifestation of the Whole Self' is defined by which psychological state?",
            "options": [
                "The complete elimination of the Inner Child's past traumas",
                "The integration of the shadow, the adult ego, and the inner child into a cohesive identity",
                "The total dominance of the Adult Self over emotional impulses",
                "A state where the False Self is used strategically for social gain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Whole Self is achieved through integration—bringing together the shadow, adult ego, and inner child—rather than the elimination of parts or the dominance of one over the others."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Architecture of Play' (Lesson 2), what is the primary neurobiological benefit of 'low-stakes play' for a healing Inner Child?",
            "options": [
                "It increases cortisol to improve alertness",
                "It triggers Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in the prefrontal cortex specifically for logic",
                "It down-regulates the amygdala while stimulating the release of dopamine and endorphins",
                "It forces the False Self to remain active in social settings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Play is a neurobiological 'safety signal' that reduces amygdala activation (fear) and increases reward-based neurotransmitters, facilitating deeper healing."

                "Relational sovereignty is about controlling the behavior of others",
                "Standard boundaries are external; sovereignty is an internal state of self-governance and energetic autonomy",
                "Sovereignty requires cutting off all contact with childhood triggers",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms"
            ],

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Long-Term Depression (LTD) is the process by which synaptic connections weaken through disuse, effectively 'pruning' old, unhealthy neural pathways."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
