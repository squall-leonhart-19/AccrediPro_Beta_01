            "options": [
                "To immediately replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations",
                "To map the landscape of core wounds and identify the 'original scene' of the trauma",
                "To confront the biological parents about their past mistakes",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Explore' phase focuses on mapping the core wounds (such as abandonment or betrayal) and understanding the historical context/landscape where these wounds were formed."

            "question": "Which neurobiological change is typically observed in the brain of an individual with chronic developmental trauma during an emotional flashback?",
            "options": [
                "Increased activity in the Prefrontal Cortex and decreased Amygdala response",
                "Hyper-activation of the Hippocampus leading to vivid, chronological memory recall",
                "Hypo-activation of the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and hyper-activation of the Amygdala",
                "A significant increase in Gray Matter volume in the Broca’s area"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During a flashback, the 'thinking brain' (PFC) often goes offline, while the 'alarm center' (Amygdala) becomes hyper-active, causing the individual to feel the past as if it is happening in the present."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to Pete Walker’s framework discussed in Lesson 3, what is the defining characteristic of an 'Emotional Flashback'?",
            "options": [
                "A clear, visual 'movie-like' replay of a specific traumatic event",
                "An intense feeling state (shame, dread, or abandonment) without a clear visual memory",
                "A physical rash that appears during times of high stress",
                "The ability to logically analyze the situation while feeling calm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional flashbacks are primarily 'feeling-toned' rather than visual; the survivor is transported into the emotional atmosphere of the original trauma without necessarily remembering the specific details."

            "question": "A client presents with a persistent 'Core Wound' where they feel they must achieve high levels of success to be worthy of love. Which wound does this most likely represent?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Inadequacy or Performance wound is characterized by the belief that one's value is tied to their output or perfection, often stemming from conditional love in childhood."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "In the 'Connect' phase, what is the 'Internal Sanctuary' technique designed to achieve?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Internal Sanctuary is a visualization and somatic tool used to create a sense of 'neurobiological safety,' allowing the inner child to feel secure enough to begin the healing process."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 emphasizes 'Non-Judgmental Witnessing' during the Listen phase. Why is 'fixing' the child's pain immediately considered counterproductive?",
            "options": [
                "Fixing is too expensive for most clients",
                "It bypasses the child's need for attunement and can feel like another form of dismissal",
                "The practitioner should never help a client feel better",
                "Fixing only works if the client is over the age of 50"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attunement requires 'being with' the emotion. Jumping to a 'fix' often signals to the inner child that their current feelings are unacceptable, which can reinforce shame."

                "Asking the client to write a letter of apology to their younger self",
                "Using hypnosis to delete memories of shameful events"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Historical validation dissolves shame by showing the client that their reactions (like freezing or people-pleasing) were actually brilliant survival adaptations given the environment they were in."

            "id": "q14_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is the stage where the practitioner moves from simply witnessing the inner child's pain to actively stepping into the role of the 'Functional Adult' who can provide reparenting."

                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex",

                "The HPA Axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is associated with social engagement and safety, which is the physiological foundation required for inner child work."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah feels a sudden, overwhelming sense of 'smallness' and terror when her boss gives her constructive feedback. According to the RECLAIM Method™, what is the very first step Sarah should take?",

                "Analyze why her boss is being unfair (Explore)",
                "Recognize that she is in an emotional flashback (Recognize)",

                "Quit her job to avoid the trigger (Master)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first step of RECLAIM is 'Recognize.' Without identifying that a flashback is occurring, the client remains merged with the wounded child and cannot apply the other healing steps."
