            "options": [
                "To intellectually analyze the childhood origin of a current conflict.",
                "To identify the immediate somatic signature and physiological shift occurring in the body.",
                "To immediately replace a negative thought with a positive affirmation.",
                "To confront the person who triggered the emotional response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Recognize' phase is a bottom-up approach focused on decoding somatic triggers—identifying heart rate changes, muscle tension, or temperature shifts before cognitive analysis begins."

                "The Humiliation Wound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Injustice wound manifests through the 'Rigid' mask, where the individual seeks perfection, blocks feelings, and prioritizes being 'right' or 'efficient' to avoid the pain of unfairness."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "When implementing 'Somatic Safe Space Anchoring' (Connect phase), what is the physiological purpose of the 'Ventral Vagal Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate the sympathetic nervous system for increased alertness.",
                "To trigger the 'freeze' response to numb emotional pain.",
                "To signal the brain's safety centers and down-regulate the amygdala's alarm response.",
                "To increase cortisol production to help the client 'fight' through the memory."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ventral Vagal anchoring uses somatic cues to signal safety to the brain, effectively down-regulating the amygdala and allowing the client to remain present rather than becoming flooded."

                "Offer immediate solutions to stop the child's crying.",
                "Explain to the Inner Child why their perspective is factually incorrect.",
                "Provide a non-judgmental, 'bottom-up' presence that validates the emotion without needing to fix it.",
                "Redirect the client to a happy memory to avoid re-traumatization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Radical Attunement requires 'witnessing'—a state of being fully present with the emotion without judgment or the urge to 'fix' it, which facilitates true somatic release."

            "id": "q12_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introjected shame occurs when the 'outer critic' (caregiver/society) becomes an 'inner critic.' The Affirm phase works to externalize this voice and recognize it as 'not mine.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Betrayal wound leads to the 'Controller' mask, characterized by a need for power, skepticism of others' motives, and a drive to ensure they are never vulnerable to deceit again."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "During the 'Manifest' phase, why is 'Embodied Play' considered a critical metric for successful Inner Child integration?",
            "options": [
                "It proves the client has enough free time for hobbies.",
                "It signifies the nervous system is in a state of 'Social Engagement' and safety, moving beyond survival mode.",
                "It is a way to distract the client from remaining trauma.",
                "It is used primarily to improve the client's physical fitness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Play is a high-level nervous system state. The ability to engage in spontaneous, non-performative play indicates that the client has moved out of chronic 'fight/flight' into a regulated state of authenticity."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study referenced in Lesson 2 found that practitioners who utilized 'Somatic Decoding' saw what percentage increase in client emotional regulation compared to talk-therapy alone?",

                "15%",
                "32%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As noted in the research highlights, somatic-first interventions (like the Recognize phase) often yield significantly higher regulation results (approx. 64%) than purely cognitive approaches."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Architecture' of the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™ as a whole?",
            "options": [
                "A linear checklist where steps are never repeated.",
                "A cognitive-behavioral framework focused exclusively on thought records.",
