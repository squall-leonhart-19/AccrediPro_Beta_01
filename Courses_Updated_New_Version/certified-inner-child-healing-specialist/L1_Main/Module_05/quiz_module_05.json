            "question": "According to the neurobiology of validation (Lesson 1), what is the primary effect of consistent affirmation on the Autonomic Nervous System?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the Sympathetic Nervous System to increase focus.",
                "It activates the Ventral Vagal complex, promoting a state of social engagement and safety.",
                "It suppresses the Prefrontal Cortex to allow for emotional release.",
                "It triggers a mild 'freeze' response to allow the body to rest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validation acts as a 'safety signal' to the brain, activating the Ventral Vagal branch of the Vagus nerve, which downregulates the 'fight-or-flight' response and fosters a sense of internal security."

            "id": "q5_2",

            "options": [
                "A healthy self-assessment.",
                "A Core Shame Script.",
                "A temporary emotional state.",
                "An externalized conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Core Shame Scripts are deeply internalized 'I am' statements that equate a person's entire identity with a perceived flaw or failure, often formed during early childhood development."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "When working with a 'Wounded Toddler' (ages 1-3) archetype, which affirmation is most developmentally appropriate for addressing the need for autonomy and belonging?",
            "options": [
                "'Your intellectual contributions are highly valued.'",
                "'You are allowed to have your own feelings and still be loved.'",
                "'You should focus on your career goals.'",
                "'Your mistakes are learning opportunities for your future self.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Toddlers are in the developmental stage of 'Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt.' Affirming that they can have their own feelings while remaining connected/loved addresses their core developmental need."

            "id": "q5_4",

            "options": [
                "To distract the mind from painful thoughts.",
                "To replace physical exercise in the healing process.",
                "To bridge the gap between cognitive understanding and a 'felt sense' of safety in the body.",
                "To increase the heart rate to mimic excitement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive affirmations often fail if the body still feels 'under threat.' Somatic affirmation uses touch, breath, and posture to ensure the body 'believes' the words being spoken."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Dismantling Inherited Shame,' what is the significance of 'Intergenerational Mapping'?",
            "options": [
                "It tracks the physical location of ancestors.",
                "It helps the client identify which shame scripts were 'passed down' rather than being their own original thoughts.",
                "It is used to blame parents for current failures.",
                "It is a method for predicting future genetic illnesses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intergenerational mapping allows clients to externalize shame by recognizing it as a 'generational burden' they inherited, which helps reduce the personal weight of that shame."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 describes 'Grief as Affirmation.' Why is validating 'What Ifs' (e.g., 'What if I had been protected?') considered therapeutic?",
            "options": [
                "It encourages the client to live in the past.",
                "It creates a sense of victimhood that prevents progress.",
                "It honors the reality of the loss and validates that the child deserved better.",
                "It is used to build a legal case against perpetrators."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validating the 'What Ifs' is an act of radical truth-telling. It affirms that the child’s needs were legitimate and that the absence of those needs being met is a valid cause for grief."

                "'I am here now, and I am not leaving you.'",

                "'People always leave eventually.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Abandonment Wound fears isolation. The most healing affirmation is the promise of 'presence'—specifically, the adult self promising to stay with the inner child."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what characterizes the 'Transition Phase' from Affirmation to Integration?",
            "options": [
                "The client no longer needs to do any healing work.",
                "The affirmations begin to feel like 'facts' rather than 'exercises.'",
                "The client becomes dependent on the coach for daily affirmations.",
                "The client experiences an increase in shame scripts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration occurs when the new, affirming beliefs become the default neural pathway. The client moves from 'doing' affirmations to 'being' the affirmed self."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that self-affirmation specifically reduces activity in which brain region during social rejection?",
            "options": [
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)",
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Medulla Oblongata"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dACC is associated with the 'social pain' of rejection. Self-affirmation has been shown to dampen activity in this region, making social threats feel less catastrophic."

            "id": "q5_10",

                "The intervention failing.",
                "The client becoming over-emotional.",
                "The nervous system shifting from a state of high arousal to a state of completion and safety.",
                "A need to immediately stop the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These physiological signs indicate that the body is processing stored tension and accepting the affirmation, signaling a shift in the autonomic nervous system toward regulation."
