            "question": "When transitioning from 1:1 sessions to a Group Healing Model (L1), what is the most significant shift required in the practitioner’s role?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from a direct interventionist to a facilitator of collective safety and group resonance",
                "Increasing the number of hours spent on direct client communication each week",
                "Decreasing the depth of the healing work to accommodate more people",
                "Focusing exclusively on administrative tasks while the group self-regulates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Scaling to groups requires the practitioner to master 'holding the container' for multiple nervous systems simultaneously, shifting from individual repair to facilitating collective resonance."

            "id": "q35_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, High-Ticket Inner Child Retreats are distinguished from standard workshops primarily by which factor?",
            "options": [
                "The luxury level of the physical accommodation provided",
                "The inclusion of a 12-month follow-up program",
                "The 'Compressed Transformation' model and high-proximity access to the specialist",
                "The requirement for participants to have completed 50 hours of 1:1 therapy first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket retreats and intensives rely on 'compressed transformation,' where the value is found in the depth of work achieved in a short window through high-proximity guidance."

            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "During the digital productization of the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™ (L3), why is the 'Containment' phase considered the most difficult to automate?",
            "options": [
                "Because it requires the highest amount of video storage space",
                "Because it often requires real-time nervous system co-regulation that static content cannot provide",
                "Because clients typically skip this phase if it is not a live session",
                "Because the legal trademarks on the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™ prohibit digital recording"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital products must include 'safety rails' because the co-regulation provided in 1:1 settings is harder to replicate in a self-paced digital environment."

            "id": "q35_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4, a 'Referral Ecosystem' is most effective for a specialist when it includes:",

                "A reciprocal network of non-competing professionals (e.g., nutritionists, somatic workers) who serve the same avatar",
                "Cold-calling other therapists to ask for their overflow clients",
                "Exclusively using automated Facebook ads to find new leads"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A referral ecosystem is built on trust and alignment with other practitioners who support different aspects of the same client's holistic healing journey."

                "Generic clinical descriptions that avoid emotional language entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Agitating trauma-based pain points can trigger the Inner Child's 'freeze' response; ethical marketing focuses on the safety and possibility of the transformation."

            "id": "q35_6",
            "question": "In Operational Excellence (L6), what is the primary purpose of implementing an 'Automated Onboarding Sequence'?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate the need for any human contact during the first month",
                "To ensure the client feels held, informed, and safe during the vulnerable period between payment and the first session",
                "To maximize the amount of upsell offers the client receives",
                "To reduce the practitioner's tax liability through software deductions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Automation in a healing business should serve the client's nervous system by providing immediate clarity and 'holding' after they make the vulnerable investment to heal."

                "To ensure that other practitioners are delivering the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™ with fidelity to its core safety principles",
                "To calculate the monthly royalty fees owed to the founder",
                "To prevent other healers from using the same colors in their branding",
                "To ensure the specialist never has to work with clients again"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The primary risk of a certification model is 'dilution' of the method; integrity checks ensure that the brand's promise of healing remains consistent across all certified practitioners."

            "id": "q35_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 identifies 'Empathy Bypass' as a symptom of compassion fatigue. How does this manifest in a scaling healer?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empathy bypass is a defensive mechanism where the healer detaches emotionally because their own 'cup' is empty, often due to scaling without proper self-care systems."

            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "What is the 'Hybrid Scaling Model' mentioned in the productization of the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid Model allows for scale (via digital content) while maintaining the high-impact results of the specialist's presence (via live group elements)."

            "id": "q35_10",
            "question": "Sustainable Growth (L8) suggests that for every 20% increase in client volume, the practitioner should:",
            "options": [
                "Increase their personal therapy or supervision hours to process the increased energetic load",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As the energetic container expands to hold more clients, the practitioner requires more 'containment' for themselves through supervision or personal healing to prevent burnout."
