            "question": "According to the 'Niche Dominance' framework, why is a specific sub-niche (e.g., Inner Child Healing for Executives) more profitable than a generalist approach?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for lower pricing due to higher volume.",
                "It reduces the need for specialized training.",
                "It increases perceived authority and allows for premium 'specialist' pricing.",
                "It limits the number of competitors to zero."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specialization creates 'perceived expertise.' When a client sees a specialist for their specific problem, they are willing to pay a premium because the solution feels tailor-made for their unique pain points."

                "The educational gap between the practitioner and the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective marketing highlights the distance between where the client is now (pain) and where they want to be (transformation), positioning your Inner Child framework as the bridge."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A short, experiential lead magnet (like an audio meditation) allows the lead to experience your voice and methodology immediately, building trust through a small transformation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In trauma-informed work, the discovery call is about safety and alignment. Pressuring a client can trigger their 'fight-or-flight' response, which is counterproductive to healing."

                "It is always illegal in every country.",
                "It triggers the client's survival brain (scarcity wound), forcing a decision from a place of fear rather than alignment.",
                "It makes the practitioner look too busy.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed marketing avoids triggering the client's nervous system. False scarcity exploits survival fears, which is the opposite of providing a safe healing environment."
