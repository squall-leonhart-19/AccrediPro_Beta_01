            "question": "According to the Psychology of Collective Healing (L1), what is the primary benefit of 'Universalization' in an Inner Child group setting?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the facilitator to step back and let the group lead itself entirely.",
                "It reduces the shame-load by showing participants that their 'secret' wounds are shared by others.",
                "It ensures that every participant reaches the same level of healing at the same time.",
                "It eliminates the need for individual somatic processing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universalization is a core therapeutic factor where participants realize they are not alone in their suffering, which significantly decreases the toxic shame associated with childhood trauma."

            "question": "In the R.E.C.L.A.I.M.™ Group Curriculum (L2), which phase is specifically designed to transition the group from individual reflection to interpersonal safety?",
            "options": [
                "Recognize",
                "Explore",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Connect' phase focuses on building bridges between the participants' inner children and the group collective, fostering the safety required for deeper 'Listen' and 'Accept' work."

            "id": "q34_3",

            "options": [
                "Only 20% of the group should speak during a single session.",
                "The facilitator should only spend 20% of the time on somatic exercises.",
                "A facilitator should aim to keep the group's collective arousal within 20% of their 'Window of Tolerance' to avoid mass dysregulation.",
                "20% of participants will likely experience a 'healing crisis' during the workshop."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 20% rule is a guideline to ensure the group stays regulated; pushing the collective intensity too far beyond the window of tolerance can lead to 'contagious' dysregulation."

                "One member is blamed for all the group's problems.",
                "The group begins to treat the facilitator as a collective 'parental figure' who must provide perfect care.",
                "Participants only interact with the facilitator and ignore other members.",
                "The facilitator projects their own inner child wounds onto the loudest member."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group-as-a-whole transference occurs when the collective group projects parental expectations or authority-related wounds onto the facilitator."

            "options": [
                "To provide a space for the facilitator to critique the participants' progress.",
                "To allow one participant to speak while others provide silent, somatic presence, validating the 'Little One' without interruption.",
                "To force participants to confront their 'Inner Critic' in front of a crowd.",
                "To practice cognitive behavioral reframing of childhood memories."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Witnessing Circle is about 'holding space'; it provides the inner child with the experience of being seen and heard without judgment or the need to be 'fixed' by others."

            "options": [
                "The time spent on lunch breaks.",
                "The sleep cycle between days, where the subconscious processes the day's emotional labor.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In multi-day workshops, the sleep cycle allows for subconscious integration. Facilitators must check in on the 'morning after' to address dreams or emotional residue from the previous day's work."

                "To remove the participant from the room immediately to protect the others.",
                "To use a 'Grounding Anchor' to bring the individual back to the present moment while maintaining the group's safety.",
                "To ignore the behavior so the participant doesn't feel singled out.",
                "To ask the group to vote on whether the participant should stay."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The facilitator must provide immediate somatic grounding for the flooded individual while simultaneously 'containing' the group energy to prevent a chain reaction of dysregulation."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, 'Launching & Scaling,' why is a 'Beta Pilot' recommended before a full public launch?",
            "options": [
                "To charge the highest possible price to a small group.",
                "To test the 'flow' of the R.E.C.L.A.I.M.™ curriculum and gather testimonials for social proof.",
                "To avoid having to use a legal contract with participants.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Beta Pilot allows the specialist to refine the timing, exercises, and group dynamics of their specific program while building the credibility needed for a larger launch."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "A participant in your group, 'Sarah,' consistently interrupts others to talk about her own trauma. Based on L4 (Group Dynamics), this 'Monopolizing' behavior is often:",
            "options": [
                "A sign that Sarah is the most advanced person in the group.",
                "A defense mechanism of the 'Inner Child' seeking the exclusive attention of the 'parent' (facilitator).",
                "A reason to terminate Sarah's participation immediately.",
                "Purely a personality trait that cannot be addressed in healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monopolizing is frequently a manifestation of an inner child who felt invisible or had to compete for resources in their family of origin, projecting that need onto the group."

        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "Statistically, research into group trauma work (L1) suggests that peer-to-peer 'Resonance' accounts for approximately what percentage of the perceived healing value by participants?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 10%",
                "Exactly 25%",

                "100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies on group dynamics consistently show that 60-70% of participants cite the 'resonance' and 'shared experience' with peers as the most transformative element of the program, often more so than the facilitator's direct interventions."
