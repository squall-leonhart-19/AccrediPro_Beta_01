            "question": "In Lesson 1, what is the primary ethical reason for defining a narrow 'Niche' in trauma recovery?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize profit margins by charging premium rates for specialty services.",
                "To ensure the specialist operates within their specific scope of competency and prevents accidental re-traumatization.",
                "To make it easier for search engines like Google to index the website.",
                "To reduce the number of discovery calls the specialist has to perform."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical niching is about competency and safety. By specializing, the practitioner ensures they have the specific tools and knowledge required for a particular type of trauma, thereby protecting the client from inadequate care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "Traditional marketing often uses the 'PAS' (Problem, Agitation, Solution) formula. Why is 'Agitation' considered problematic in trauma-informed copywriting?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive to write agitation-based copy.",
                "It requires too much word count for modern social media algorithms.",
                "It intentionally dysregulates the prospect's nervous system to bypass cognitive filters, which violates the principle of safety.",
                "It focuses too much on the solution rather than the client's current experience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed messaging avoids 'agitation' because survivors may already be in a state of hyperarousal. Intentionally triggering their pain points to force a sale is predatory and can cause a 'vulnerability hangover' or immediate shutdown."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "Which design element is a hallmark of a 'Trauma-Informed Digital Presence' mentioned in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "Auto-playing video testimonials to build immediate social proof.",
                "High-contrast neon colors to grab attention in a busy feed.",
                "A 'Quick Exit' button and predictable navigation that enhances the user's sense of agency and safety.",
                "Pop-up windows that offer discounts if the user tries to leave the page."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety and Agency are core pillars. A 'Quick Exit' button allows users in unsafe environments to leave quickly, and predictable navigation prevents the cognitive overwhelm that can trigger a survival response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Content Strategy: Education as Acquisition' lesson, what is the goal of providing psychoeducational content?",
            "options": [
                "To prove the specialist is smarter than the client.",
                "To reduce the 'Trust Gap' by demonstrating value and helping the prospect understand their own symptoms before they buy.",
                "To replace the need for actual recovery sessions.",
                "To increase the specialist's academic citations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For trauma survivors, trust is difficult to establish. Psychoeducational content acts as a 'low-stakes' way for the prospect to vet the specialist's approach and feel empowered by understanding their own nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_5",
            "question": "When building a 'Strategic Referral Ecosystem' (Lesson 5), what is a 'Warm Handoff'?",
            "options": [
                "Giving a client a physical brochure of another provider.",
                "Sending a mass email to all practitioners in the area.",
                "A collaborative process where the specialist introduces the client to a vetted partner, ensuring continuity of safety and trust.",
                "Paying a commission to anyone who refers a client to the practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A warm handoff involves active communication between the specialist, the client, and the new provider to ensure the client doesn't feel 'dropped' or forced to retell their trauma story to a stranger without preparation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "During a Trauma-Informed Discovery Call, what should a specialist do if a prospect begins to 'flood' (over-disclose deep trauma details) early in the call?",
            "options": [
                "Take detailed notes to save time during the first official session.",
                "Gently interrupt and use grounding techniques to bring the prospect back to the 'here and now' to prevent dysregulation.",
                "Encourage them to continue so they feel heard and validated.",
                "Immediately end the call as they are clearly not ready for recovery work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allowing a prospect to 'flood' on a discovery call often leads to a 'vulnerability hangover,' where they feel overexposed and ashamed, leading them to ghost the specialist. The specialist must maintain the 'Window of Tolerance' even during the sales process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_7",
            "question": "Which advertising tactic is considered 'Ethical' under the AccrediPro standards for trauma specialists?",
            "options": [
                "Using 'False Scarcity' (e.g., 'Only 1 spot left!') to trigger a FFF response.",
                "Retargeting ads that follow a user around the internet for 90 days after they visit a sensitive page.",
                "Value-based ads that offer a free, helpful resource (like a grounding guide) to build rapport.",
                "Using 'Fear-Based' headlines like 'If you don't heal now, your kids will suffer.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical advertising focuses on 'Value-First.' It invites the prospect into a relationship by being helpful rather than using psychological pressure, fear, or intrusive tracking."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, what is the 'Safety-First' requirement for scaling to group recovery programs?",
            "options": [
                "The group must have at least 20 people to be profitable.",
                "Participants must be pre-screened for emotional regulation skills and current stability to ensure group safety.",
                "The program must be the cheapest option available in the market.",
                "All participants must have the exact same trauma history."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling trauma work requires careful curation. One dysregulated participant can trigger the entire group, so pre-screening for 'stability and regulation' is essential to maintain a therapeutic environment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "What does the 'Rule of 10-12' refer to in trauma-informed client acquisition?",
            "options": [
                "The number of sessions a client must commit to upfront.",
                "The average number of touchpoints a trauma survivor may need before feeling safe enough to book a call.",
                "The maximum number of clients a specialist should see in a week.",
                "The percentage of revenue that should be spent on marketing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While general marketing suggests 7 touchpoints, trauma recovery often requires more (10-12) because the 'buying' decision involves a significant assessment of safety and trust, which takes time to build."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "A specialist's website uses 'Empowerment Language' instead of 'Savior Language.' Which of these is an example of Empowerment Language?",
            "options": [
                "'I am the only one who can fix your broken past.'",
                "'Stop suffering today and let me save your marriage.'",
                "'You have the innate capacity to heal; I provide the tools and safe container to support your journey.'",
                "'Follow my 3-step system to be cured of PTSD forever.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowerment language restores agency to the client, positioning the specialist as a guide or facilitator rather than a 'savior.' Savior language creates an unhealthy power dynamic that can hinder true recovery."
