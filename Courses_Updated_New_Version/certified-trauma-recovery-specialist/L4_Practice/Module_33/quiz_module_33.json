            "question": "A Certified Trauma Recovery Specialist (CTRS) is working with a client who begins to experience active, command-type auditory hallucinations. What is the legally and ethically required action regarding Scope of Practice?",
            "options": [
                "Utilize advanced somatic grounding techniques to stabilize the client.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed psychiatrist or clinical psychologist as this falls outside the CTRS scope.",
                "Increase the frequency of sessions to daily check-ins until the hallucinations subside.",
                "Consult with a peer supervisor but continue the trauma recovery plan as hallucinations are a common trauma response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active psychosis or command hallucinations fall outside the scope of recovery coaching and require immediate clinical intervention. Continuing to treat without a clinical referral creates significant professional liability."

            "question": "In high-acuity trauma work, why is 'Process-Oriented Informed Consent' considered superior to a single signed document at intake?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to charge for 'consent sessions' separately.",
                "It serves as a legal loophole to avoid HIPAA compliance.",
                "Trauma often impairs cognitive processing and memory, meaning the client may not fully grasp the risks while in a dysregulated state.",
                "It is a requirement of the 2023 Federal Trauma Recovery Act."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma impacts the prefrontal cortex, often making it difficult for clients to process complex legal risks during initial sessions. Revisiting consent ensures the client remains an active, informed participant in their recovery."

        {
            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "The 'Duty to Warn' (Tarasoff v. Regents) principle requires a specialist to break confidentiality under which specific condition?",
            "options": [
                "When a client admits to past illegal drug use.",
                "When a client expresses a vague desire to 'see the world burn.'",
                "When a client identifies a specific target and expresses a clear intent to cause physical harm.",
                "When a client's spouse requests access to the session notes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Tarasoff ruling established that mental health professionals (and by extension, recovery specialists in many jurisdictions) must warn third parties when a specific, identifiable threat is made against them."

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Defensible Documentation' in a trauma recovery context?",
            "options": [
                "Writing as little as possible to avoid being subpoenaed.",
                "Recording every word the client says verbatim to ensure accuracy.",
                "Notes that clearly demonstrate the 'Standard of Care' was met through objective observations and interventions.",
                "Storing all client notes on a personal, unencrypted mobile device for quick access."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Defensible documentation protects the practitioner by showing that their actions were consistent with professional standards, used objective data, and followed a logical recovery plan."

            "options": [
                "Oregon (where the specialist is located).",
                "New York (where the client is located).",
                "Both jurisdictions simultaneously.",
                "The jurisdiction is determined by the specialist's business registration state only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In telehealth, the 'site of service' is generally considered to be the physical location of the client at the time of the session. The specialist must adhere to the laws of the client's state."

            "id": "q33_6",

                "Stating the number of years of experience in the field."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using titles like 'Therapist' or 'Counselor' when not licensed by a state board is a legal violation (Title Protection) and misleads the public regarding the practitioner's credentials."

            "question": "What is the primary legal risk of 'Commingling Funds' in an LLC business structure?",
            "options": [
                "It results in an automatic IRS audit.",
                "It allows a plaintiff to 'pierce the corporate veil,' making the specialist's personal assets vulnerable in a lawsuit.",
                "It increases the cost of professional liability insurance.",
                "It prevents the specialist from accepting credit card payments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Commingling personal and business finances suggests the LLC is not a separate legal entity, which can lead a court to ignore the liability protection of the LLC (piercing the veil)."

            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "According to HIPAA standards, how should 'Psychotherapy Notes' (or sensitive session observations) be handled compared to the general 'Personal Health Information' (PHI) record?",
            "options": [
                "They must be kept in the same file to ensure continuity of care.",
                "They should be destroyed immediately after the session.",
                "They must be maintained separately from the rest of the individual's medical record for increased privacy.",
                "They are not recognized as a legal category under HIPAA."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HIPAA provides extra protections for psychotherapy/process notes, requiring them to be kept separate from the general medical/billing record to prevent unnecessary disclosure of sensitive details."

            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "A client presents with suicidal ideation but no plan or immediate intent. What is the most appropriate 'Risk Management' step?",
            "options": [
                "Call 911 immediately to initiate an involuntary hold.",
                "Ignore it, as ideation is common in trauma and usually harmless.",
                "Conduct a formal lethality assessment and document a collaborative safety plan.",
                "Terminate the relationship immediately to avoid liability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A formal assessment and a safety plan demonstrate the specialist followed the 'Standard of Care.' Over-reacting (calling 911 without cause) can damage the therapeutic alliance, while under-reacting creates liability."

        {
            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Statute of Limitations' relevance to record-keeping in trauma recovery?",
            "options": [
                "It dictates how much a specialist can charge for records.",
                "It determines the minimum period (often 7-10 years) that records must be retained before destruction.",
                "It limits the number of sessions a client can have in a year.",
                "It prevents clients from seeing their own records after 2 years."
