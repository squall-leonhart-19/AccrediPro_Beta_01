            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An LLC or S-Corp provides a 'corporate veil' that protects personal assets from business liabilities, which is critical in high-risk fields like trauma recovery."

                "It can trigger the sympathetic nervous system and coerce a survival-based 'fawn' or 'flight' response in trauma survivors.",
                "It is illegal under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines for all businesses.",
                "It makes the practitioner look less professional to referral partners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed marketing prioritizes felt safety; high-pressure tactics can bypass a survivor's frontal lobe and trigger a dysregulated decision-making process."

                "It incentivizes the practitioner to work slower to make more money.",
                "It creates a 'ceiling' on income and ties the practitioner's value to time spent rather than the transformation achieved.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing creates an income ceiling and can lead to burnout. Value-based pricing focuses on the profound impact of recovery, allowing for higher margins and better sustainability."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
