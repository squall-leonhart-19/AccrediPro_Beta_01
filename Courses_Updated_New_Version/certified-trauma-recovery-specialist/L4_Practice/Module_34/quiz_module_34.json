            "question": "According to Irvin Yalom’s therapeutic factors, which concept is most critical in trauma groups for reducing the 'shame-isolation' cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Universality",
                "Altruism",
                "Catharsis",
                "Imitative Behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Universality allows trauma survivors to recognize that they are not alone in their experiences or symptoms, which is the primary antidote to the isolation and shame often associated with PTSD."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When designing a 12-week trauma recovery curriculum, what is the recommended distribution of content according to the 'Three-Phase Model'?",
            "options": [
                "4 weeks Processing, 4 weeks Stabilization, 4 weeks Integration",
                "6 weeks Stabilization, 4 weeks Processing, 2 weeks Integration",
                "2 weeks Stabilization, 8 weeks Processing, 2 weeks Integration",
                "10 weeks Processing, 2 weeks Stabilization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In trauma-informed design, the majority of the early curriculum (Phase 1) must focus on stabilization and resource building before moving into processing (Phase 2) and integration (Phase 3)."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "A group member begins to experience a dissociative flashback during a session. Which facilitation technique is the priority for 'containment'?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the member to 'lean into' the memory to process it",
                "Asking other members to share similar experiences to build empathy",
                "Directing the member through external sensory grounding (e.g., the 5-4-3-2-1 technique)",
                "Silently holding space until the flashback passes naturally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Containment requires immediate grounding to the 'here and now' through sensory engagement to pull the client out of a dissociative state and ensure safety."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered an absolute contraindication (exclusion criterion) during the screening and intake process for a trauma recovery group?",

                "History of Complex PTSD",
                "High levels of social anxiety",
                "Active, untreated substance use disorder that prevents attendance or sobriety during sessions",
                "Occasional intrusive thoughts about the trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active substance use that interferes with a member's ability to remain present or sober is a contraindication as it compromises both their safety and the group's therapeutic container."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "In a somatic-based workshop, what is the primary purpose of 'titration'?",
            "options": [
                "Exposing the client to the full intensity of their trauma to build resilience",
                "Breaking down traumatic activation into small, manageable 'drops' to avoid overwhelming the nervous system",

                "Ensuring that every participant shares their story in equal time increments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a somatic technique used to process trauma in very small amounts, preventing the participant from being re-traumatized by an over-activated nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "During Lesson 6, 'subgrouping' was discussed. Why is the formation of secret subgroups outside of the main group sessions considered a threat to recovery?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the facilitator's workload",
                "It prevents the facilitator from charging extra fees",
                "It creates 'in-groups' and 'out-groups,' which triggers abandonment wounds and inhibits group-wide cohesion",
                "It is only a problem if the subgroup members are of different genders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Subgrouping creates a fragmented group dynamic where information is withheld from the whole, often mirroring dysfunctional family systems and triggering trauma-related fears of exclusion."

        {
            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "When delivering a virtual trauma program, which 'tech-safety' protocol is mandatory for ethical practice?",
            "options": [
                "Requiring all participants to use a specific brand of laptop",
                "Ensuring the facilitator has the physical address and local emergency contact for every participant in case of a crisis",
                "Recording every session and posting it to a public YouTube channel",
                "Allowing participants to keep their cameras off and remain anonymous"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because the facilitator is not physically present, they must have the participant's location and local emergency resources on hand to provide help if a participant becomes acutely suicidal or dysregulated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "A 2022 study on trauma group outcomes indicated that 'Outcome Informed Facilitation' (OIF) improved success rates by what percentage compared to non-monitored groups?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "12%",
                "28%",
                "Over 40%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data-driven facilitation, which uses regular assessment tools like the PCL-5, has been shown to improve outcomes by approximately 28% through iterative adjustments to the program."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah,' a facilitator noticed she was 'scapegoated' by the group after she expressed anger. What is the recommended facilitator response to manage this dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "Removing Sarah from the group immediately",
                "Identifying the scapegoating as a collective defense mechanism and bringing the focus back to the group's shared anxiety",
                "Telling the group they are being 'mean' and demanding an apology",
                "Ignoring the behavior to see if the group can resolve it themselves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scapegoating is usually a sign of group-level anxiety; the facilitator must address it as a group process issue rather than an individual conflict to maintain the safety of the container."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "Which metric is most effective for measuring the 'Iterative Design' success of a trauma workshop over multiple cohorts?",
            "options": [
                "The number of 'likes' on the program's social media page",
                "The total revenue generated per workshop",
                "Pre- and post-program scores on the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale",
                "The 'Delta' (change) in standardized symptom scores (e.g., GAD-7 or PHQ-9) across subsequent cohorts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Iterative design relies on measuring the rate of improvement (the Delta) between cohorts to determine if curriculum or facilitation changes are actually increasing the program's efficacy."
