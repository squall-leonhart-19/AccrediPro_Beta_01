            "options": [
                "Providing psychoeducation on the nervous system",
                "Diagnosing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or other DSM-5 conditions",
                "Teaching grounding and stabilization techniques",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma Recovery Specialists focus on recovery and coaching; clinical diagnosis is reserved for licensed mental health professionals (LCSW, LPC, Psychologists, etc.)."

            "question": "In ethical branding, why is the use of 'trauma porn' (graphic imagery or descriptions of traumatic events) discouraged in marketing materials?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive to produce high-quality graphic content",
                "It violates copyright laws regarding survivor stories",
                "It can cause vicarious trauma or triggers in potential clients before they have established safety",
                "It makes the brand look unprofessional and cluttered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed marketing prioritizes the safety of the audience. Graphic content can dysregulate potential clients, contradicting the 'safety-first' principle of trauma recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visual clutter and high contrast can be overstimulating. A neutral, calm, and stable background helps the client maintain focus and stay within their window of tolerance."

                "To receive kickbacks and finders' fees for every client referred",
                "To ensure clients have access to higher levels of care (e.g., psychiatry) when their needs exceed your scope",
                "To eliminate the need for any marketing or branding efforts",
                "To create a monopoly on trauma services in your local area"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "To convince the client to sign up for the most expensive package"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "Digital products are generally less profitable than 1-on-1 sessions",
                "The lack of real-time support means the content must be exceptionally 'safe' and low-trigger",
                "It is illegal to sell digital recovery products in most jurisdictions",
                "Digital products require a medical license to sell"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-paced products lack the 'co-regulation' of a live session, meaning practitioners must be extremely careful to avoid triggering content that a client cannot navigate alone."

                "Burnout is only physical, while VT is only emotional",
                "VT specifically involves a shift in the practitioner’s worldview and cognitive schemas due to exposure to client trauma",
                "Burnout only happens to new practitioners, while VT only happens to veterans",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable in trauma work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout is related to workload and stress, Vicarious Trauma specifically alters how the practitioner perceives the world (e.g., loss of a sense of safety or trust)."

                "The client's right to pause or stop a session at any time for any reason",
                "A guarantee that the client will be fully healed within 10 sessions",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowerment and choice are core pillars of trauma-informed care. Explicitly stating the right to stop ensures the client feels in control of the process."
