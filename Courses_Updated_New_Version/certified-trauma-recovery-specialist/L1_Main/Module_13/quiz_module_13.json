            "question": "Within the ANCHOR Framework™, the 'N' refers to 'Neural Regulation.' What is the primary neurobiological goal during this phase of the recovery process?",
            "options": [
                "Suppression of the amygdala's response through cognitive suppression",
                "Modulating the HPA axis to reduce cortisol flooding and return to homeostasis",
                "Increasing the speed of the 'low road' processing in the thalamus",
                "Inducing a state of dorsal vagal shutdown for physical rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural Regulation focuses on stabilizing the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis to manage the body's stress response and reduce the toxic effects of prolonged cortisol exposure."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the Advanced Somatic Calibration lesson, which Polyvagal state must be 'co-regulated' to facilitate safe trauma processing?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' system. Recovery work is most effective when the client is calibrated within this state, often facilitated by the specialist's own regulated nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is the practice of breaking down traumatic content into manageable pieces, ensuring the client stays within their Window of Tolerance and avoids re-traumatization."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive flexibility allows survivors to move away from rigid, trauma-based 'all-or-nothing' thinking and adapt their perspectives to the present reality."

            "options": [
                "Trauma is only passed down through verbal storytelling and behavior",
                "Trauma can leave chemical marks on genes that alter the stress response (HPA axis) in offspring",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic research shows that environmental stressors like trauma can cause DNA methylation, which influences how genes are expressed in future generations, particularly regarding stress reactivity."
