            "question": "According to the Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) framework developed by Calhoun and Tedeschi (2006), which domain involves a significant shift in life priorities and the pursuit of new paths that were previously unconsidered?",
            "options": [
                "Personal Strength",
                "New Possibilities",
                "Spiritual Change",
                "Relational Depth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'New Possibilities' domain specifically refers to the survivor's realization that new paths and interests are available, often leading to career changes or new life directions after the 'seismic shake' of trauma."

            "question": "In the context of Narrative Reconstruction (Lesson 3), what is the primary difference between a 'Survivor's Path' and 'The Hero's Journey'?",
            "options": [
                "The Hero's Journey focuses on the trauma event, while the Survivor's Path ignores it.",
                "The Survivor's Path is about returning to the pre-trauma self, while the Hero's Journey is about fundamental transformation.",
                "Narrative Reconstruction aims to move from fragmented traumatic memory to a coherent autobiographical narrative that integrates the trauma as a chapter, not the whole book.",
                "There is no difference; they are used interchangeably in the ANCHOR framework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal of narrative reconstruction is coherence—transforming fragmented, intrusive memories into an integrated story where the trauma is a significant but contained part of the person's identity."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Lesson 6 emphasizes 'Embodied Sovereignty.' Which somatic capacity is defined as the ability to perceive internal bodily sensations like heartbeat, breath, and hunger, which is often dampened in trauma survivors?",
            "options": [
                "Proprioception",
                "Exteroception",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Developing interoceptive awareness is critical for sovereignty, as it allows survivors to recognize and trust their own physiological signals."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Porous Boundaries' in their relationships, often feeling responsible for their partner's emotional regulation and unable to say no. According to Lesson 5, what is the primary goal of Relational Reclamation for this client?",
            "options": [
                "Moving toward Rigid Boundaries to ensure total safety.",
                "Developing 'Functional Autonomy' and the ability to differentiate self from other.",
                "Ending all current relationships to start fresh with a 'clean slate.'",
                "Learning to ignore the partner's emotions entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relational Reclamation involves moving from porous or rigid boundaries to healthy, flexible ones where 'Functional Autonomy' allows the survivor to be intimate without losing their sense of self."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'C' in ANCHOR stands for Connection. Sustaining growth requires ongoing connection to one's internal values and a supportive external community to prevent isolation-induced relapse."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frankl proposed that the 'Search for Meaning' is the primary human drive. In trauma recovery, finding meaning in the aftermath of suffering is a core component of existential re-anchoring."

            "options": [
                "Less than 10% of survivors ever experience PTG.",

                "PTG is only possible in survivors of childhood trauma, not adult-onset trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that PTG is surprisingly common, with 50-70% of survivors reporting growth in areas like personal strength or appreciation of life following a traumatic event."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Reclamation' (Lesson 1), what is the defining characteristic of 'Sovereignty' as opposed to 'Survival'?",
            "options": [
                "Sovereignty is the total absence of any trauma triggers.",
                "Survival is reactive and fear-based; Sovereignty is proactive and values-based.",
                "Sovereignty means the survivor no longer needs any social support.",
                "Survival is a physiological state, while Sovereignty is purely a mental state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reclamation is the transition from a life dictated by trauma responses (Survival) to a life directed by internal values and conscious choice (Sovereignty)."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "When applying the ANCHOR framework to professional mastery (Lesson 8), why is 'Nurturing Self-Regulation' (the N) prioritized before Narrative Reconstruction?",
            "options": [
                "Because the narrative doesn't actually matter in the long run.",
                "To ensure the client has the physiological stability to process the trauma story without becoming re-traumatized.",
                "Because self-regulation is easier to teach than narrative work.",
                "Narrative reconstruction is actually the first step, not the last."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-regulation (the 'N' in ANCHOR) provides the 'window of tolerance' necessary for the client to engage in the cognitive and emotional work of narrative reconstruction without flooding their nervous system."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A client who has reached the 'Sustaining Growth' phase (Lesson 7) experiences a minor relapse into old avoidant behaviors. How does the ANCHOR framework suggest the specialist handle this?",
            "options": [
                "Treat it as a failure and return to Module 1.",
                "Ignore it to avoid giving the behavior power.",
                "Use the 'O' (Observation) and 'R' (Resilience) to view the lapse as data rather than defeat.",
                "Immediately increase the frequency of somatic sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ANCHOR framework teaches that lapses are opportunities for 'Observation' (understanding the trigger) and 'Resilience' (practicing the return to sovereignty), rather than signs of failure."
