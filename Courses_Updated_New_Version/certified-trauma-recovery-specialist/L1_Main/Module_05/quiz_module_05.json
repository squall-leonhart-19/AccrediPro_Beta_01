            "question": "Which neurobiological marker is most closely associated with the brain's ability to undergo neuroplasticity and recover from the structural changes caused by chronic trauma?",
            "options": [
                "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)",
                "Cortisol",
                "Adrenaline",
                "Glutamate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a protein that acts as 'brain fertilizer,' facilitating the growth of new neurons and synapses, which is essential for the neuroplasticity required in resilience and recovery."

        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A client transitions from saying 'This happened to me and I am broken' to 'I have the tools to navigate my reactions to what happened.' This represents a shift toward which psychological concept?",
            "options": [
                "External Locus of Control",
                "Internal Locus of Agency",
                "Spiritual Bypassing",
                "Cognitive Dissonance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal Locus of Agency involves the belief that one has the power to influence their own recovery and emotional state, moving away from a passive victim identity."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "In the context of sustainable coping mechanisms, why is emotional 'suppression' considered maladaptive compared to 'reappraisal'?",
            "options": [
                "Suppression is too difficult for most clients to master.",
                "Suppression leads to immediate emotional outbursts.",
                "Suppression increases physiological sympathetic arousal despite the outward appearance of calm.",
                "Reappraisal requires a higher IQ than suppression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that suppressing emotions actually increases autonomic nervous system activity (heart rate, blood pressure), whereas cognitive reappraisal reduces both the emotional experience and the physiological response."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "According to Dan Siegel's 'Window of Tolerance' model, a client experiencing 'hypo-arousal' is likely to exhibit which of the following symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Panic, rage, and hyper-vigilance",
                "Numbness, dissociation, and 'shut down' responses",
                "Optimal social engagement and curiosity",
                "Rapid heartbeat and racing thoughts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is the 'low' end of the window, characterized by the parasympathetic dorsal vagal response, leading to numbness, emptiness, and immobilization."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Kristin Neff’s model of Self-Compassion consists of three core components. Which of the following is NOT one of those components?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Self-compassion is distinct from self-esteem; self-esteem is based on evaluation and comparison, while self-compassion is a way of relating to oneself with kindness during failure."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "The concept of 'Co-Regulation' in social resilience suggests that:",
            "options": [
                "Clients must learn to regulate entirely on their own before seeking social support.",
                "The presence of a regulated, calm person can help stabilize the nervous system of a traumatized individual.",
                "Group therapy is only effective if all members are at the same stage of recovery.",
                "Social support is a secondary concern compared to individual CBT."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation is a biological process where one person's autonomic nervous system influences another's, providing a 'safety signal' that helps the traumatized person return to their Window of Tolerance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Which somatic technique involves moving the client's attention back and forth between a place of safety/resource and a place of traumatic tension?",

                "Titration",

                "Cognitive Restructuring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is the process of swinging the attention between a resource (safety) and the trauma (stress) to help the nervous system process small amounts of 'charge' without becoming overwhelmed."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "In Relapse Prevention Planning, what is the primary difference between an 'Early Warning Sign' and a 'Trigger'?",
            "options": [
                "Triggers are internal; Early Warning Signs are external.",
                "Triggers are immediate stimuli; Early Warning Signs are subtle internal shifts indicating a decline in stability.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably.",
                "Early Warning Signs only occur after a full relapse has happened."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triggers are specific events that cause an immediate reaction, while Early Warning Signs (like sleep changes or increased irritability) indicate the client is moving toward a state of vulnerability."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) found that which factor was the strongest predictor of positive long-term outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "The severity of the initial trauma",
                "The age of the individual at the time of trauma",
                "The quality of perceived social support",
                "The use of pharmacological interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perceived social support is consistently identified as the most significant moderator of trauma recovery and the primary catalyst for Post-Traumatic Growth."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "When building a 'Resilience Toolkit,' why is it important to include 'Bottom-Up' interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Because they focus on changing thoughts first.",
                "Because they address the physiological 'charge' in the body that the thinking brain cannot always access.",
                "Because they are faster than 'Top-Down' interventions like talk therapy.",
                "Because 'Top-Down' interventions have been proven ineffective for trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up interventions (somatic, breathwork, grounding) address the survival brain and autonomic nervous system, which are often 'hijacked' during trauma and unresponsive to logic-based 'top-down' talk therapy alone."
