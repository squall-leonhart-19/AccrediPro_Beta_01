                "To provide a corrective emotional experience through the therapist’s non-judgmental presence",
                "To force the client to admit they were at fault for the traumatic event",
                "To immediately eliminate all somatic symptoms through cognitive reframing",
                "To create a detailed chronological timeline for legal testimony purposes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Witnessing serves as a corrective emotional experience where the specialist validates the client's reality, countering the isolation and gaslighting often associated with trauma."

                "The belief that physical exercise can cure psychological distress",
                "The belief that trauma only happens to people with specific genetic markers",
                "The belief that memory is a perfect recording of past events"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Trauma shatters the three fundamental assumptions: the world is benevolent, the world is meaningful, and the self is worthy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 explains that the body stores trauma as 'somatic echoes,' where physiological dysregulation manifests as physical symptoms even when the mind tries to suppress the memory."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Betrayal trauma is unique because it involves a violation of trust by a person or entity necessary for the victim's survival or well-being, often leading to 'betrayal blindness.'"

                "Shame is always healthy, whereas guilt is always toxic",
                "Guilt is felt in the body, whereas shame is only a cognitive thought",
                "Trauma survivors never experience guilt, only shame"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As discussed in Lesson 5, shame is global and attacks the person's identity, making it a more significant barrier to recovery than guilt, which focuses on specific actions."
