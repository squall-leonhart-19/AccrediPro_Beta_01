            "question": "The ANCHOR Framework™ begins with 'A - Acknowledge Impact.' According to Lesson 2, why is this step prioritized before any cognitive reframing?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner can diagnose the client with a specific DSM-V disorder immediately",
                "To validate the survivor's neurobiological reality and establish a foundation of safety and trust",
                "To force the survivor to relive the traumatic event in detail to desensitize the amygdala",
                "To determine the legal liability of the perpetrator before beginning recovery work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging impact focuses on validating the neurobiological reality of trauma, which builds the safety and trust necessary for all subsequent recovery work."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of trauma (Lesson 2), which brain structure is often referred to as the 'smoke detector' that remains hyper-sensitive in survivors?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The amygdala functions as the brain's 'smoke detector,' identifying threats; in trauma survivors, it often becomes hyper-responsive, triggering the survival response even in safe environments."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 (Normalize Response) emphasizes shifting from 'What is wrong with you?' to 'What happened to you?' This shift primarily serves to:",

                "De-stigmatize survival adaptations by viewing them as functional responses to abnormal stress",
                "Excuse harmful behaviors so the survivor does not have to take responsibility for their actions",
                "Identify which family members are to blame for the survivor's current condition",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Normalizing responses involves re-framing symptoms (like dissociation or hypervigilance) as brilliant survival adaptations that were necessary at the time of the trauma."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory discussed in Lesson 4 (Calibrate System), which state is characterized by immobilization, 'fainting,' or 'playing dead'?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal complex is responsible for the immobilization response, often manifesting as numbness, dissociation, or 'freezing' when the system is overwhelmed."

                "Coaching requires the client to write a 50-page autobiography",
                "Coaching prioritizes survivor agency, allowing the client to choose what, when, and how much to share",
                "Coaching focuses exclusively on the perpetrator's motives rather than the survivor's experience",
                "There is no distinction; both require the survivor to relive the trauma repeatedly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Honoring Narrative in a trauma-informed context means the survivor has full agency and control over their story, preventing re-traumatization by avoiding forced disclosure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Optimizing resilience involves identifying 'trauma-logic'—the distorted beliefs formed during trauma—and gently reframing them to support the survivor's current reality and agency."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'New Possibilities' domain of PTG involves a survivor developing new interests or a new life path that was not present before the trauma, such as a new career or mission."

            "options": [
                "Burnout is caused by the content of the client's stories, while Vicarious Trauma is caused by paperwork",
                "Vicarious Trauma involves a shift in the practitioner's world-view; Burnout is general exhaustion from work stress",
                "Burnout only happens to new practitioners, while Vicarious Trauma only happens to veterans",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical settings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious Trauma is a specific transformation of the practitioner's inner experience resulting from empathetic engagement with trauma material, whereas burnout is general job-related stress."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that survivors who feel 'high levels of agency' during the recovery process are how much more likely to report Post-Traumatic Growth?",

                "1.5 times more likely",
                "2.2 times more likely",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that survivor agency—the feeling of being in control of one's recovery—is a massive predictor of PTG, with studies showing up to a 3.8x increase in growth outcomes."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "During a session, a client begins to breathe rapidly and look around the room frantically (Hyperarousal). Using the ANCHOR Framework, which immediate action is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Ask the client to describe the traumatic event in more detail to 'get it out'",
                "Ignore the behavior and continue with the cognitive reframing exercise",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is dysregulated (outside their Window of Tolerance), the 'Calibrate' phase must be used immediately to bring the nervous system back to a state of safety before any other work can continue."
