            "options": [
                "To analyze the client's childhood narrative in detail",
                "To regulate the nervous system and expand the window of tolerance",
                "To confront the perpetrator of the trauma directly",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Calibrate' phase focuses on somatic stabilization and polyvagal regulation to help the client manage physiological arousal and stay within their window of tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic trauma is associated with hippocampal atrophy (affecting memory context) and a hyper-responsive amygdala (heightened threat detection)."

                "Type II refers to a single, unexpected event like a car accident",
                "Type II involves prolonged, repeated exposure to traumatic events, often relational in nature",
                "Type I only occurs in adulthood, while Type II only occurs in childhood",
                "Type II trauma does not result in physiological symptoms"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type I trauma is a single-incident event, whereas Type II (Complex) trauma involves repetitive, chronic exposure, often within an interpersonal context."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response involves 'people-pleasing' and the abandonment of personal boundaries to appease a perceived threat or maintain a sense of safety."

                "Titration is for physical pain, while Pendulation is for emotional pain",
                "Titration breaks trauma into tiny, manageable pieces; Pendulation moves focus between distress and a resource",
                "Pendulation is used only in the 'Acknowledge' phase, while Titration is used in 'Optimize'",
                "There is no difference; the terms are synonymous"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down and 'slicing' the experience thin, while Pendulation is the rhythmic shifting between a 'hot' spot (distress) and a 'cool' spot (resource/safety)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the body's 'surveillance system' that scans the environment for cues of safety or danger below the level of conscious thought."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PTG involves Personal Strength, New Possibilities, Spiritual Change, Improved Relationships, and Appreciation of Life. It does not involve forgetting the trauma."

            "question": "During a session, a client becomes 'flooded'—they are shaking, hyperventilating, and unable to speak. What is the immediate priority according to the ANCHOR framework?",

                "Ask the client to describe the trauma in detail to 'get it out'",
                "Interpret the client's body language to find the root cause",
                "Utilize grounding techniques to bring the client back into their Window of Tolerance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is outside their window of tolerance (flooded/hyperaroused), the priority is stabilization and grounding to return to a state of safety."
