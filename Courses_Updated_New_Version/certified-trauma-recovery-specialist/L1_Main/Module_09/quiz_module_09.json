            "options": [
                "To begin immediate cognitive restructuring of maladaptive thoughts.",
                "To name the traumatic experience and its multifaceted impacts without the pressure to 'fix' or resolve them.",
                "To ensure the client can recount the entire trauma narrative in chronological order.",
                "To desensitize the client to the emotional triggers of their past."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Acknowledge phase is about validation and naming the reality of the experience. It focuses on 'what happened' and its impact, creating a foundation of truth before moving into normalization or resolution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma often results in a 'bottom-up' hijacking where the Amygdala (the alarm system) is hyper-reactive, while the PFC (the rational brake) is under-active, making emotional regulation difficult."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma impacts the Prefrontal Cortex, leading to deficits in executive functions such as inhibitory control, working memory, and the ability to switch tasks or regulate emotions from the 'top-down'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ANCHOR™ intake is trauma-informed, meaning it prioritizes the client's current window of tolerance and safety over the specialist's need for a complete data set in the first encounter."
