            "question": "In the ANCHOR Framework™, what is the primary objective of the 'Normalize Response' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the client with a specific DSM-5 disorder",
                "To shift the perspective from 'What is wrong with you?' to 'What happened to you?' and de-stigmatize survival adaptations",
                "To force the client to relive the traumatic event until they are desensitized",
                "To provide immediate cognitive reframing of the traumatic event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Normalizing the response involves validating that symptoms like hypervigilance or dissociation were 'brilliant adaptations' for survival, removing the shame of 'pathology.'"

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Which neurobiological structure is often referred to as the 'Smoke Detector' of the brain, becoming hyper-responsive in trauma survivors?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala identifies threats; in trauma survivors, it remains in a state of high alert, often bypassing the 'Top-Down' logic of the Prefrontal Cortex."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "During the 'Calibrate System' phase, a specialist uses somatic grounding. What is the physiological goal of 'Extended Exhalation' breathing?",
            "options": [
                "To increase cortisol production for better focus",
                "To stimulate the Vagus nerve and activate the Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)",
                "To trigger the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) for an energy boost",
                "To decrease the amount of oxygen reaching the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations (where the out-breath is longer than the in-breath) signal the Vagus nerve to initiate the 'rest and digest' response, lowering the heart rate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'emotional numbing' and a sense of being 'spaced out' during sessions. According to the Window of Tolerance model, this client is likely in which state?",

                "Hyper-arousal",
                "The Optimal Zone",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by numbness, dissociation, and a 'shut down' of the nervous system (the dorsal vagal response)."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "The 'Honor Narrative' phase emphasizes 'Agency.' How does this differ from traditional exposure-based therapies?",
            "options": [
                "The specialist decides which parts of the story are most important to tell",
                "The client is required to tell the story in chronological order to receive credit",
                "The client retains full control over the pacing, depth, and timing of their story to prevent re-traumatization",
                "The narrative is ignored in favor of purely somatic exercises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Agency means the survivor is the expert of their own experience and controls the narrative process, which is essential for reclaiming power lost during trauma."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In the 'Acknowledge Impact' phase, why is 'Naming the Wound' considered a critical step?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the specialist to bill insurance more effectively",
                "It provides a sense of 'linguistic mastery' over the experience, moving it from the chaotic right brain to the logical left brain",
                "It proves the client is telling the truth",
                "It focuses exclusively on the physical injuries sustained"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Giving language to trauma helps integrate the experience and reduces the power of the 'unspoken' or 'invisible' wounds."

                "Telling the client to 'think positive' and ignore the past",
                "Identifying and shifting 'Traumatic Beliefs' (e.g., 'I am unsafe') into 'Adaptive Beliefs' (e.g., 'I was in danger, but I am safe now')",
                "Memorizing a list of affirmations",
                "Correcting the client's memory of the event to make it less scary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing targets the core beliefs formed during trauma and helps the client adopt a more nuanced, survival-based perspective."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "Tedeschi and Calhoun's (2004) research on Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) suggests that growth occurs in which of the following domains?",

                "Personal strength, New possibilities, and Spiritual change",
                "Complete erasure of the traumatic memory",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PTG involves positive psychological changes experienced as a result of struggling with highly challenging life circumstances, including personal strength and new life directions."

            "id": "q10_9",

                "Silent meditation for 20 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory grounding (5-4-3-2-1) pulls the client out of an internal 'flashback' or panic state and back into the safety of the present environment."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "What defines the 'Specialist Path' compared to a traditional clinical approach?",
            "options": [
                "The Specialist focuses on 'what is right' and 'what is next' (recovery coaching), while maintaining a trauma-informed lens",
                "The Specialist is allowed to prescribe medication",
                "The Specialist does not need to worry about ethical boundaries",
                "The Specialist focuses exclusively on the past and ignores future goals"

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Trauma Recovery Specialists focus on stabilization, regulation, and post-traumatic growth, moving beyond the 'deficit-based' model of traditional pathology."
