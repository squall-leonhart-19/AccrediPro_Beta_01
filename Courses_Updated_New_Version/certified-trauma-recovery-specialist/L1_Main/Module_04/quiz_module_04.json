            "question": "Which statement best describes the difference between traumatic memory and narrative memory as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Traumatic memory is linear and chronological, while narrative memory is fragmented.",
                "Traumatic memory is stored as sensory fragments without a 'timestamp,' whereas narrative memory is organized into a cohesive story.",
                "Narrative memory is stored in the amygdala, while traumatic memory is stored in the hippocampus.",
                "Traumatic memory is easily verbalized, while narrative memory is purely somatic."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traumatic memories are often 'timeless' and sensory-based because the high-stress response inhibits the hippocampus from organizing the event into a chronological narrative."

            "question": "In the context of pacing a client's story, what is the primary objective of 'Titration'?",
            "options": [
                "Moving back and forth between a resource of safety and a point of distress.",
                "Breaking down traumatic content into the smallest, most manageable 'drops' to prevent nervous system flooding.",
                "Encouraging the client to tell the entire story from beginning to end in one sitting.",
                "Identifying the specific cognitive distortions present in the narrative."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the work and processing trauma in tiny increments to ensure the client stays within their Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A practitioner asks a client, 'How long has the Guilt been following you around?' This is an example of which narrative technique?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Externalization involves linguistic shifts that separate the person from the problem, treating the issue (like Guilt) as an outside entity rather than an inherent character flaw."

            "id": "q4_4",

                "Times when the trauma was at its absolute worst.",
                "Moments where the client demonstrated agency, resistance, or resilience that contradict the 'victim' narrative.",
                "The specific sensory triggers that lead to a flashback.",
                "The final goals a client sets at the beginning of the recovery process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unique outcomes are instances that don't fit the dominant problem-saturated story, providing the foundation for a new narrative of survival and agency."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "When a client is 'stuck for words' or becomes non-verbal during narrative work, which 'bottom-up' intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client to think more logically about the event.",

                "Correcting the client's grammar to help them structure their thoughts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-verbal narratives are held in the body; focusing on somatic sensations allows the nervous system to process information that the Broca's area (speech center) cannot yet articulate."

            "id": "q4_6",

            "options": [
                "A physical location where the trauma occurred.",
                "A conflicting belief or 'bottleneck' in thinking that prevents the natural processing of the trauma.",
                "A period of time where the client refuses to attend sessions.",
                "The moment a client begins to cry during a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stuck points are often assimilated or over-generalized beliefs (e.g., 'It was my fault') that block the integration of the traumatic event."

                "To suppress emotions indefinitely so the client never feels them again.",
                "To provide a mental 'vault' or space to safely store distressing imagery between sessions.",
                "To force a client to face their fears through prolonged exposure.",
                "To ensure the client does not speak about their trauma to anyone else."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Containment is a stabilization tool used to help clients 'put away' intense material at the end of a session so they can function in their daily lives."

            "id": "q4_8",

            "options": [
                "The client completely forgets that the trauma ever happened.",
                "The client can tell the story with a clear beginning, middle, and end without being overwhelmed by physiological arousal.",
                "The client views the trauma as the only defining characteristic of their life.",
                "The client chooses to never speak of the event again."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration means the trauma has been moved from 'fragmented sensory experience' to 'autobiographical narrative memory,' where it is a part of the past, not an ever-present threat."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "During a session, a client begins to breathe rapidly and their eyes glaze over while describing a memory. Using the principle of 'Pendulation,' the specialist should:",

                "Encourage them to push through and finish the story.",
                "Immediately stop the session and refer them to a psychiatrist.",
                "Guide the client's attention away from the distress toward a 'resource' or neutral body sensation to recalibrate.",
                "Ask the client to describe the trauma in even more vivid detail to achieve catharsis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation involves shifting focus from the 'vortex of trauma' to the 'vortex of healing/resource' to help the nervous system regain equilibrium."

                "Magnification",
                "Emotional Reasoning",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional reasoning occurs when a person believes that because they feel a certain way (e.g., 'I feel guilty'), it must be a reflection of objective reality (e.g., 'I am guilty')."
