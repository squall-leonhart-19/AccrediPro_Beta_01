            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which state is characterized by social engagement, a steady heart rate, and the ability to feel 'safe and connected'?",
            "options": ["Dorsal Vagal Shutdown", "Sympathetic Activation", "Ventral Vagal Stabilization", "Functional Freeze"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal complex is responsible for the 'Social Engagement System,' allowing for safety, connection, and homeostasis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a racing heart, shallow breathing, and racing thoughts. According to the Window of Tolerance model, which state are they likely experiencing?",
            "options": ["Hypo-arousal", "Hyper-arousal", "Optimal Arousal", "Dorsal Collapse"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal is characterized by 'too much' energy in the system, leading to anxiety, panic, and sympathetic dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which grounding technique specifically utilizes 'proprioceptive input' to help a client feel the physical boundaries of their body?",
            "options": ["5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Scan", "Diaphragmatic breathing", "Self-hugging or pushing against a wall", "Aromatherapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioception is the sense of self-movement and body position; deep pressure or resistance (like pushing a wall) provides the brain with clear data about the body's boundaries."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the context of sensory-based regulation, 'vestibular input' refers to which of the following?",
            "options": ["The sense of smell and its link to the limbic system", "The sense of balance and spatial orientation", "The ability to track internal organ sensations", "The perception of temperature on the skin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vestibular system, located in the inner ear, processes movement and balance, which can be used to either calm or alert the nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Research on the 'Physiological Sigh' (two quick inhales followed by a long, slow exhale) suggests it is one of the fastest ways to:",
            "options": ["Increase cortisol levels for morning alertness", "Offload carbon dioxide and trigger the parasympathetic nervous system", "Induce a state of hyperventilation to clear the lungs", "Stimulate the sympathetic 'fight' response"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The physiological sigh rapidly re-inflates the alveoli and offloads CO2, signaling the Vagus nerve to slow the heart rate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "When a client experiences 'interoceptive' triggers, they are reacting to which of the following?",
            "options": ["External loud noises or bright lights", "Specific visual reminders of a past event", "Internal bodily sensations, such as a localized tightening or heart rate increase", "The facial expressions of the coach"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the perception of sensations from inside the body. Trauma survivors often misinterpret these normal physiological shifts as signs of impending danger."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "The concept of 'Co-regulation' relies on the coach's ability to maintain a regulated presence. This is biologically mediated through:",
            "options": ["The Prefrontal Cortex's logical reasoning", "Mirror Neurons and the process of Neuroception", "The Endocrine system's release of adrenaline", "The client's ability to follow verbal instructions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Through neuroception, a client's nervous system 'scans' the coach's nervous system. Mirror neurons allow the client to 'catch' the coach's state of calm."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "When designing a Daily Calibration Routine, the principle of 'Titration' refers to:",
            "options": ["Completing 60 minutes of intensive trauma processing daily", "Introducing small, manageable amounts of somatic awareness to avoid system overwhelm", "Moving rapidly between a traumatic memory and a safe resource", "Tracking heart rate variability (HRV) every hour"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the work and breaking it into small, 'digestible' pieces so the nervous system can integrate the experience without re-traumatization."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Stephen Porges (2011) emphasizes that the 'Social Engagement System' is biologically inhibited when the heart rate exceeds approximately:",
            "options": ["60 beats per minute", "80 beats per minute", "100 beats per minute", "140 beats per minute"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When the heart rate rises above 100 bpm, the 'vagal brake' is typically released, and the system shifts into sympathetic defense, making social connection difficult."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah feels 'numb, cold, and foggy' during a session. She is likely in a Dorsal Vagal state. Which intervention is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Deep, silent meditation and stillness", "Gentle, rhythmic movement or a cold water splash to the face", "A 10-minute 4-7-8 breathing exercise", "Discussing the details of her childhood trauma"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dorsal Vagal (hypo-arousal) requires 'up-regulating' interventions like movement or sensory shocks (cold) to gently bring the system back into the Window of Tolerance."
