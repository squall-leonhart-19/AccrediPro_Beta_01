            "question": "In the context of 'The Architecture of the Post-Traumatic Self,' what is the primary difference between a 'Trauma-Centric Identity' and a 'Reclaimed Identity'?",
            "options": [
                "A trauma-centric identity forgets the past, while a reclaimed identity remembers it.",
                "A trauma-centric identity views the self as fundamentally broken by the event, whereas a reclaimed identity views the trauma as a chapter in a larger narrative.",
                "A trauma-centric identity is always associated with high self-esteem, while reclaimed identity is more modest.",
                "There is no functional difference; they are different terms for the same psychological state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A trauma-centric identity involves the 'colonization' of the self where the person defines their entire existence by their wounding. Reclaiming identity involves integrating the trauma as a significant part of the story without letting it define the whole person."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Language and Agency, shifting from 'I was made to feel worthless' to 'I am currently experiencing a sense of worthlessness' represents which psychological shift?",
            "options": [
                "From an internal locus of control to an external one.",
                "From active voice to passive voice to reduce responsibility.",
                "From a passive, victim-based narrative to an active, observer-based agency.",
                "A regression into emotional reasoning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shifting language from being the 'object' of an action to the 'subject' of an experience increases agency. It moves the client from a passive recipient of trauma to an active participant in their own recovery and observation."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "In Values-Based Living (Lesson 3), what is the metaphorical distinction between 'Values' and 'Goals'?",
            "options": [
                "Values are the destination; goals are the vehicle.",
                "Values are the compass (direction); goals are the landmarks (milestones).",
                "Goals are internal; values are external requirements.",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Values are ongoing directions (e.g., 'being a kind person') that are never 'completed,' acting like a compass. Goals are specific, achievable milestones (e.g., 'volunteering once a week') that align with those values."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The five domains of PTG are: New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Personal Strength, Spiritual Change, and Appreciation of Life. PTG does not mean the absence of distress or symptoms; in fact, PTG and PTSD symptoms often coexist."

            "id": "q6_5",

            "options": [
                "The client refuses to speak to anyone and remains isolated.",
                "The client has a clear sense of where they end and others begin.",
                "The client's emotions and sense of self are overly dependent on the reactions and moods of others.",
                "The client is aggressive and dominates every conversation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Enmeshed boundaries involve a blurring of the self-other distinction, often a survival strategy where the survivor hyper-tunes to others' emotions to ensure safety, leading to a loss of personal identity."

                "The goal of recovery is to return the client to exactly who they were before the trauma.",
                "The 'gold' (repair) makes the vessel stronger and more beautiful for having been broken.",
                "Scars should be hidden with cosmetic surgery or makeup to improve self-esteem.",
                "The past should be discarded to make room for a completely new, unrelated self."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold. In trauma recovery, it represents the idea that the 'repair'—the wisdom and strength gained through recovery—is valuable and should be honored, not hidden."

                "Forget the lessons of the past."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High 'future-self continuity' means the individual feels a strong connection to the person they will become. This connection acts as a motivator for delayed gratification and health-promoting behaviors."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, 'Mastery' is defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The complete absence of any trauma triggers for the rest of one's life.",
                "The ability to control every person in one's environment.",
                "The capacity to navigate triggers and life challenges using a robust set of internal tools and a stable sense of self.",
                "Becoming a certified therapist."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery is not the absence of challenge, but the development of self-efficacy—the belief and demonstrated ability to handle emotional states and external challenges without losing one's reclaimed identity."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "According to meta-analyses on Post-Traumatic Growth, approximately what percentage of trauma survivors report at least one domain of PTG?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 10%",
                "Exactly 100%",
                "Between 30% and 70%",
                "Only those who did not have severe PTSD"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that between 30% and 70% of survivors report some form of PTG. It is a common phenomenon, though it is not universal and should not be forced upon clients."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "When a client experiences a 'lapse' in their reclaimed identity (e.g., falling back into old survival patterns), the 'Maintenance' phase (Lesson 8) suggests the Specialist should:",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client they have failed the program.",
                "Reframe the lapse as 'data' for further growth rather than a 'relapse' into the old self.",
                "Start the entire ARC protocol over from Module 1.",
                "Ignore the lapse to avoid discouraging the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the maintenance and mastery phase, lapses are treated as 'clinical data.' They provide insight into remaining triggers or areas where boundaries need strengthening, reinforcing the 'Kintsugi' idea of ongoing integration."
