            "question": "During a 'Survival Brain' hijack (L1), which neurobiological shift occurs that most significantly impairs a client's ability to engage in traditional talk therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Increased activation of the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)",
                "Decreased activity in the Amygdala",
                "Decreased activity in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and Broca's Area",
                "Increased connectivity between the Hippocampus and the Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-induced 'speechless terror' is caused by decreased activity in the PFC (executive function) and Broca's Area (speech), while the Amygdala becomes hyper-responsive, prioritizing survival over logic."

                "Strict Behavioral Modification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ANCHOR Framework™ rejects the pathology-focused medical model in favor of a non-pathologizing approach that views symptoms as adaptive survival strategies."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In the 'Acknowledge Impact' phase (L3), what is the primary purpose of 'Trauma Mapping'?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to relive the trauma in chronological order",
                "To identify and blame the individuals responsible for the trauma",
                "To visualize the somatic, emotional, and cognitive landscape of the client's current nervous system state",
                "To provide a diagnosis for insurance billing purposes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma Mapping is an assessment tool used to help clients and practitioners visualize the holistic impact of trauma on the body and mind without requiring a detailed narrative of the event."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 (Normalize Response), why is it critical to reframe 'symptoms' as 'survival strategies'?",
            "options": [
                "To minimize the severity of the client's pain",
                "To reduce shame and align the client with their innate biological wisdom",
                "To avoid legal liability for the trauma",
                "To convince the client they no longer need therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing symptoms as survival strategies reduces the 'second-hand shame' clients feel about their reactions, fostering the self-compassion necessary for recovery."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "During the 'Calibrate System' phase (L5), a client experiencing 'Dorsal Vagal Shutdown' (hypoarousal) would most benefit from which intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Deep, slow diaphragmatic breathing with long exhales",
                "Gentle sensory input and 'up-regulating' somatic movement",

                "A dark, quiet room with no sensory stimulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypoarousal requires gentle 'up-regulation' to bring the client back into the Window of Tolerance, whereas long exhales are typically used for 'down-regulating' hyperarousal."

            "id": "q15_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration ensures that trauma processing happens in small, manageable pieces, keeping the client within their Window of Tolerance and preventing system flooding."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Scaffolding provides the temporary mental frameworks needed for a client to practice new ways of thinking until those patterns become autonomous."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "According to the 'Reclaim Identity' phase (L8), what is a key distinction between 'Resilience' and 'Post-Traumatic Growth' (PTG)?",
            "options": [
                "Resilience is better than PTG",
                "Resilience is bouncing back to baseline; PTG is 'bouncing forward' into a new, more integrated version of self",
                "PTG only happens to people who did not experience severe trauma",
                "Resilience is psychological, while PTG is purely biological"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While resilience involves returning to a previous state of functioning, PTG involves a transformative shift where the individual finds new meaning and strength through the integration of their experience."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis mentioned in the module (n=8,234) demonstrated that somatic stabilization (Calibrate) prior to narrative work reduced dropout rates by:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that establishing somatic safety (the 'C' in ANCHOR) significantly increases treatment retention and efficacy, with studies showing an average 42% reduction in dropout rates."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client is struggling to find words to describe their experience but is highly aware of a 'tightness in the chest.' Which ANCHOR phase should the practitioner focus on first?",
            "options": [
                "Honor Narrative (L6)",
                "Optimize Resilience (L7)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is experiencing high somatic distress ('tightness in the chest'), the practitioner must prioritize 'Calibrate System' to stabilize the Autonomic Nervous System before attempting narrative or cognitive work."
