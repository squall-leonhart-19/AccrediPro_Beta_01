            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Normalize Response' module, how is a post-traumatic symptom like hypervigilance accurately reframed?",
            "options": [
                "As a clinical disorder that requires immediate suppression",
                "As a biological adaptation designed to ensure survival in a dangerous environment",
                "As a sign of permanent neurological damage that cannot be reversed",
                "As a cognitive failure to process environmental cues correctly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Normalizing focuses on viewing symptoms not as 'brokenness,' but as adaptive survival mechanisms that were successful in a previous high-threat environment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the Evolutionary Biology of Survival (L1), which brain structure acts as the 'smoke detector,' prioritizing speed over accuracy when detecting threat?",
            "options": [
                "Prefrontal Cortex",
                "Hippocampus",
                "Amygdala",
                "Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The amygdala is responsible for the rapid detection of threat, often bypassing the 'thinking' brain (prefrontal cortex) to initiate immediate survival responses."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (L4), which state is characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and a drop in heart rate and blood pressure?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal Stabilization",
                "Sympathetic Mobilization",

                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the most primitive survival response, involving 'freeze' or 'faint' behaviors when active fight or flight is perceived as impossible."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Which shift in language best represents the transition from a pathological to a trauma-informed perspective (L5)?",

                "Moving from 'What is wrong with you?' to 'What happened to you?'",
                "Moving from 'Patient' to 'Victim'",
                "Moving from 'Behavioral issues' to 'Lack of discipline'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The core shift in trauma-informed care is moving away from judging the person's current state ('what is wrong') to understanding their history ('what happened')."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client feels intense shame because they 'froze' during an assault rather than fighting back. Using the Polyvagal Perspective (L4), how should a specialist explain this?",
            "options": [
                "The client lacked the physical training to respond appropriately",
                "The body made an involuntary, 'bottom-up' decision that immobilization was the safest survival strategy",
                "The client's prefrontal cortex failed to analyze the situation fast enough",
                "The freeze response is a sign of psychological weakness that can be overcome with logic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Freezing is an involuntary biological response (Dorsal Vagal) that occurs when the nervous system determines that mobilization (fight/flight) is not a viable survival option."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, what is identified as the primary difference between 'Guilt' and 'Shame' in trauma recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Guilt is about the self; Shame is about the behavior",
                "Guilt is helpful for recovery; Shame is always harmful",
                "Guilt says 'I did something bad'; Shame says 'I am bad'",
                "Shame is a social emotion; Guilt is an individual emotion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shame is an internal, globalized attribution where the individual views their entire self as fundamentally flawed or 'broken' due to the trauma."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "The concept of 'Neuroplasticity' (L2) suggests that the traumatized brain is not permanently damaged, but rather:",
            "options": [
                "In a state of 'functional fixedness' that requires medication",
                "Highly efficient at detecting threat due to the strengthening of specific neural pathways",
                "Lacking the ability to form new memories",
                "Permanently rewired after the age of 25"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity means the brain has adapted its structure (like a muscle) to be better at detecting threat; recovery involves using that same plasticity to strengthen safety pathways."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When integrating 'Normalization' into the ANCHOR Framework (L8), what is the primary goal of this specific step?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the client with a specific DSM-5 disorder",
                "To eliminate all symptoms within the first three sessions",
                "To reduce the 'secondary injury' caused by self-blame and the 'broken' narrative",
                "To provide a detailed medical report for insurance purposes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Normalization aims to remove the secondary layer of suffering—the shame and self-judgment a client feels about having trauma symptoms in the first place."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'Top-Down' regulation strategy mentioned in Module 2?",
            "options": [
                "Deep diaphragmatic breathing",
                "Cognitive reframing of a symptom as a survival skill",
                "Cold water immersion to stimulate the vagus nerve",
                "Rhythmic movement or drumming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Top-down strategies involve using the higher-order 'thinking' brain (Prefrontal Cortex) to influence the lower-order 'survival' brain, such as through reframing and education."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A 2021 study on trauma-informed education showed that when survivors understand the biological basis of their symptoms, they experience:",
            "options": [
                "An increase in symptom intensity due to over-focusing",
                "No significant change in recovery outcomes",
                "A significant decrease in self-stigma and an increase in treatment adherence",
                "A dependency on biological explanations to avoid personal responsibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychoeducation and normalization are statistically linked to reduced shame (self-stigma), which is one of the greatest barriers to consistent trauma recovery work."
