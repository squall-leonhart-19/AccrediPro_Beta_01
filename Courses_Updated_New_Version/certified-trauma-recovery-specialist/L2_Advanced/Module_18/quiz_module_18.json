            "options": [
                "Linking the brainstem to the prefrontal cortex for better autonomic control.",
                "Connecting the right hemisphere's emotional and holistic processing with the left hemisphere's logical and linguistic processing.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Horizontal integration involves the communication between the right and left hemispheres via the corpus callosum, allowing a client to put words (left) to their emotional experiences (right)."

            "options": [
                "To erase the memory of the trauma entirely so the client no longer recalls it.",
                "To ensure the client can recite the events in chronological order for legal testimony.",
                "To move 'hot' implicit memories into 'cool' explicit, declarative memory systems, reducing their intrusive power.",
                "To prove to the practitioner that the client is no longer in denial."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative synthesis aims to move fragmented, sensorimotor (implicit) memories into a structured, time-stamped (explicit) narrative, which reduces the 're-living' aspect of PTSD."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The insula is the primary hub for interoception, acting as a bridge between the body's physiological state and the prefrontal cortex's conscious awareness."

            "options": [
                "To eliminate the 'weak' parts of the self to ensure they never return.",
                "To achieve 'co-consciousness' and functional collaboration between different internal states or 'parts'.",
                "To convince the client that their 'parts' are merely imaginary constructs with no value.",
                "To keep the parts separated so they do not overwhelm the client's daily functioning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is not about elimination; it is about integration, where the client acknowledges all parts of the self and fosters internal communication and collaboration."

                "The biological 'void' left in the brain after the loss of neurons during trauma.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frankl described the existential vacuum as a condition of meaninglessness, which he argued was a central challenge in psychological recovery and existential synthesis."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) identified five domains of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG). Which of the following is NOT one of those domains?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "PTG does not require the absence of symptoms; in fact, growth often coexists with ongoing distress. The five domains focus on positive psychological shifts, not the elimination of pain."

            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis mentioned in Lesson 6 found that approximately what percentage of trauma survivors report at least one domain of Post-Traumatic Growth?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that a majority of survivors (50-70%) report growth in at least one domain, highlighting the human capacity for transformation despite suffering."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "In the ANCHOR framework for long-term stability (L7), why is 'Habituation' (the 'H') critical for the client?",
            "options": [
                "It helps the client become 'bored' with their trauma story so they stop talking about it.",
                "It refers to the consistent practice of regulation skills until they become automatic 'default' responses.",
                "It encourages the client to return to their old habits from before the trauma occurred.",
                "It is a technique used to induce a hypnotic state for memory retrieval."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habituation in this context refers to the neuroplastic process of turning recovery skills into automatic habits through consistent, long-term repetition."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses the 'Integrated Practitioner.' What is a hallmark of a practitioner who has mastered 'Synthesis' in their own professional identity?",
            "options": [
                "They strictly follow one single modality and never deviate from its manual.",
                "They view themselves as an expert who 'fixes' the client's broken parts.",
                "They balance clinical expertise with a 'regulated presence,' using their own nervous system as a co-regulatory tool.",
                "They avoid all emotional connection with the client to maintain perfect objectivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery in synthesis involves the practitioner integrating their knowledge with their presence, allowing for a 'limbic resonance' that facilitates the client's integration."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah can describe her childhood abuse with clinical detachment (Left-brain dominant) but feels 'numb' and 'empty' (Right-brain deficit). Which intervention from Module 18 is most appropriate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is showing a lack of horizontal integration. Somatic-cognitive bridging helps connect her detached narrative (left brain) with her felt bodily experience (right brain/somatic) to achieve synthesis."
