            "question": "According to the neurobiological research discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary functional relationship observed in the 'traumatized brain' during a flashback?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperactivity in the prefrontal cortex and hypoactivity in the amygdala",
                "Hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex and hyperactivity in the amygdala",
                "Increased activation of Broca's area and the hippocampus",
                "Complete suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that trauma results in a 'top-down' failure where the prefrontal cortex (rational center) is unable to inhibit the hyperactive amygdala (fear center)."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory suggests that the 'Social Engagement System' is mediated by which specific neural pathway?",

                "The HPA axis negative feedback loop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the myelinated portion of the vagus nerve that supports social bonding, facial expression, and vocalization, facilitating a state of safety."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In the context of Memory Reconsolidation research (Lesson 3), how long is the typical 'reconsolidation window' during which a memory is labial and susceptible to modification?",
            "options": [
                "10 to 30 minutes",
                "2 to 6 hours",

                "72 hours to one week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empirical studies indicate that once a memory is retrieved (reactivated), it enters a labile state for approximately 2 to 6 hours before it is re-stored in long-term memory."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "PTG can coexist with PTSD symptoms; the five domains are New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Personal Strength, Spiritual Change, and Appreciation of Life."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Meta-analyses comparing EMDR and Trauma-Focused CBT (TF-CBT) generally conclude that:",
            "options": [
                "TF-CBT is significantly more effective for childhood trauma than EMDR",
                "EMDR is ineffective for survivors with dissociative features",
                "Both demonstrate comparable efficacy, though EMDR may achieve results in fewer sessions without required homework",
                "Neither modality outperforms a placebo control group in long-term follow-ups"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates both are 'Gold Standard' treatments with similar effect sizes, though EMDR is often noted for efficiency and high client retention."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment (Type D), characterized by a 'fright without solution' dynamic with caregivers, is the most significant longitudinal predictor of later dissociation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While many factors contribute, perceived social support consistently shows the strongest correlation with resilience and recovery across diverse populations."

            "question": "What is the primary benefit of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) according to emerging research in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for a trained clinician",
                "It allows for precise, graduated control over the intensity of the traumatic stimulus",
                "It is the only evidence-based treatment for complex trauma (C-PTSD)",
                "It works by permanently erasing the amygdala's fear response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VRET allows clinicians to create a controlled environment where the 'dosage' of exposure can be precisely measured and adjusted based on client physiological feedback."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Why do 'Bottom-Up' interventions (Somatic Experiencing, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy) prioritize the body over cognitive narrative in early-stage trauma recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Because trauma survivors usually have higher-than-average verbal intelligence",
                "Because the 'Broca's Area' (speech center) often shuts down during trauma, making verbal processing difficult",
                "Because cognitive interventions have been proven to cause brain damage",
                "Because the prefrontal cortex is the only area of the brain affected by trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroimaging (specifically by van der Kolk) shows decreased activation in Broca's area during trauma recall, suggesting that 'talking' may be less accessible than 'sensing' in early recovery."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "In a clinical case study regarding 'Narrative Integration,' what is the primary indicator that a traumatic memory has been successfully integrated?",
            "options": [
                "The client can no longer remember the event occurred",
                "The client experiences a 'Ventral Vagal' state while recounting the event as a past-tense story",
                "The client exhibits a 'Freeze' response every time the memory is mentioned",
                "The client can recount the event only while under the influence of sedatives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is characterized by the ability to narrate the trauma as a cohesive, past-tense story without the autonomic nervous system being hijacked into hyper- or hypo-arousal."
