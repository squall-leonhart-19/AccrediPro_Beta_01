            "question": "According to the Theory of Structural Dissociation (Van der Hart et al.), which part of the personality is responsible for managing daily life and typically 'ignores' traumatic memories to maintain functioning?",
            "options": [
                "The Apparently Normal Part (ANP)",
                "The Emotional Part (EP)",
                "The Fragmented Ego State",
                "The Defensive Subsystem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Apparently Normal Part (ANP) is the aspect of the personality that handles daily tasks (work, social roles) and often uses avoidance or numbing to keep traumatic memories at bay."

            "question": "Research indicates that individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher are approximately how many times more likely to engage in intravenous drug use compared to those with a score of 0?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The original ACE Study found that individuals with 4 or more adverse childhood experiences were 1,000% (10 times) more likely to have injected drugs."

            "options": [
                "Stabilizing the SUD for 90 days before addressing any trauma history.",
                "Addressing both the trauma and the SUD concurrently within the same clinical framework.",
                "Treating the trauma first to eliminate the 'need' for the substance.",
                "Referring the client to separate specialists for each condition to avoid boundary blurring."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrated treatment, such as the 'Seeking Safety' model, treats both conditions concurrently, recognizing that the SUD often serves as a maladaptive coping mechanism for trauma symptoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NSSI is most often used as a desperate physiological 'reset' to manage overwhelming affect or to break out of a dissociative/numb state."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "For neurodivergent clients (Autism/ADHD), why might traditional '5-4-3-2-1' sensory grounding techniques sometimes increase distress?",
            "options": [
                "Neurodivergent clients lack the cognitive capacity for grounding.",
                "The technique may trigger sensory overstimulation or 'sensory defensiveness'.",
                "The technique requires too much executive function to remember the steps.",
                "Grounding is contraindicated for all neurodivergent individuals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic or ADHD clients may have sensory processing sensitivities; forcing them to focus on external stimuli (like loud noises or bright colors) can exacerbate overstimulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yehuda's research highlighted that trauma can leave epigenetic 'marks' on the FKBP5 gene, leading to altered cortisol sensitivity in subsequent generations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "DID requires both the presence of two or more distinct personality states AND recurrent amnesia. OSDD-1 may feature distinct parts without amnesia, or amnesia without fully distinct parts."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client in a 'Functional Freeze' state appears compliant and calm but makes no progress in recovery and feels 'dead inside.' This state is dominated by which branch of the nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (High-Tone Parasympathetic)",
                "Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional freeze is a Dorsal Vagal state where the body is immobilized but 'tuned out' or dissociated to survive, often mistaken for compliance by inexperienced practitioners."

                "The client has too much empathy for their abuser.",
                "The specialist has too much empathy, leading to burnout.",
                "A breakdown in communication occurs because the specialist and client have different ways of experiencing and expressing emotions.",
                "The client lacks the ability to feel empathy for themselves."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coined by Damian Milton, this theory suggests that communication difficulties between autistic and non-autistic people are a two-way street of misunderstanding, not a deficit solely in the autistic person."

                "Feeling tired due to long working hours.",
