            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative Integration is the phase where the specialist helps the client weave fragmented, sensorimotor traumatic memories into a coherent chronological and emotional life story."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A combat veteran presents with intense guilt, social isolation, and a feeling that their 'soul is stained' after an event that violated their personal ethics, but lacks typical startle responses. What is the most likely clinical focus?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Moral injury is characterized by the psychological and spiritual impact of transgressing deeply held moral beliefs, focusing more on shame and guilt than the fear-based symptoms of traditional PTSD."

                "It is purely socialized and has no biological component"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic changes allow environmental factors like trauma to influence how genes are turned on or off without changing the underlying DNA sequence, which can be passed to offspring."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In the recovery process for survivors of sexual violence, why is 'restoring agency' prioritized over immediate narrative processing?",
            "options": [
                "Narrative processing is not effective for sexual violence",
                "To minimize the specialist's liability",
                "To counteract the fundamental loss of power and autonomy experienced during the assault",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Since sexual violence involves a total violation of bodily autonomy and power, restoring the survivor's sense of agency (the ability to make choices and control their environment) is essential for safety and stabilization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traumatic bereavement involves deaths that are sudden, violent, or preventable, which often causes the survivor to experience PTSD symptoms (like flashbacks of the death) alongside grief."

            "options": [
                "Intensive aerobic exercise",
                "Cognitive reframing of the doctor's intentions",
                "Orienting to the environment and slow 'titrated' exposure to medical tools",
                "General anesthesia for all future appointments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orienting to the present environment and using titration (breaking the experience into small, manageable pieces) helps the nervous system stay out of a freeze state during medical triggers."
