            "options": [
                "Shifting from 'What is wrong with you?' to 'What happened to you?'",
                "Prioritizing diagnostic labeling over symptomatic relief",
                "Moving from qualitative interviews to strictly quantitative psychometrics",
                "Focusing exclusively on the client's current coping mechanisms regardless of history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The core of trauma-informed care is shifting the perspective from pathology ('What is wrong') to the history of trauma and its impact ('What happened')."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "When differentiating between PTSD and CPTSD using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) as discussed in L2, which 'Disturbances in Self-Organization' (DSO) cluster is specifically assessed?",
            "options": [

                "Hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CPTSD is distinguished from PTSD in the ICD-11 by the addition of three DSO clusters: Affect Dysregulation, Negative Self-Concept, and Interpersonal Disturbances."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Somatic and Autonomic Assessment, which physiological metric is considered the 'gold standard' for measuring vagal tone and the capacity for self-regulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reflects the activity of the Vagus nerve and the Autonomic Nervous System's ability to transition between states of arousal and calm."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "A client scores a 35 on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II). Based on L4, what is the most appropriate next step for the specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately diagnose the client with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)",
                "Disregard the score as it is likely due to 'imagination'",
                "Refer for a structured clinical interview, such as the SCID-D or MID, for diagnostic clarification",
                "Stop all trauma processing until the score drops below 10"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A score above 30 on the DES-II is a clinical 'red flag' suggesting significant dissociation; it is a screening tool that requires follow-up with a diagnostic instrument like the SCID-D."

            "id": "q20_5",

                "The ability to remember dates perfectly",
                "The inability to sequence trauma memories into a logical beginning, middle, and end",

                "Over-detailing every event in a chronological list"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Temporal disintegration refers to the fragmented, non-linear way trauma is often stored and recounted, lacking a cohesive narrative flow."

            "id": "q20_6",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) does not imply the absence of distress or symptoms; it focuses on positive psychological changes resulting from the struggle with trauma."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "When conducting an attachment-based assessment (L7), an adult client who minimizes the impact of past trauma and provides very brief, non-descriptive accounts of childhood likely displays which attachment style?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dismissing-Avoidant individuals often devalue the importance of attachment relationships and provide 'idealized' or very sparse narratives during assessment."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Under the ANCHOR Roadmap integration (L8), why is the 'Assessment' phase placed before 'Normalization' and 'Co-Regulation'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the specialist can charge for more sessions",
                "To identify dissociative barriers and autonomic instability that could make normalization unsafe",
                "Because assessment data is only useful at the beginning of the process",
                "To establish a rigid hierarchy between specialist and client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessment identifies the 'terrain' of the client's nervous system, ensuring that interventions like normalization don't inadvertently trigger further dissociation or overwhelm."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that clients with high 'Narrative Fragmentation' had a higher correlation with which of the following?",

                "Higher IQ scores",
                "Lower rates of physical illness",

                "Faster recovery from acute stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative fragmentation is often a marker of severe trauma that may require specialized trauma-focused interventions rather than standard top-down CBT."

            "options": [
                "A change of 1-2 points",
                "A change of 5-10 points",

                "Any decrease, regardless of the amount"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a 5-10 point reduction on the PCL-5 represents a reliable and clinically significant improvement in PTSD symptoms."
