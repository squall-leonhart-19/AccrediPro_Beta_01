            "question": "In the ANCHOR framework of treatment planning, which phase must be established and stabilized before moving into 'Honoring the Story' (H)?",
            "options": [
                "Identity Reconstruction (R)",
                "Somatic Calibration (C)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Calibration (C) focuses on stabilization and regulation. According to phase-oriented treatment models, a client must have the capacity to regulate their nervous system before engaging in the processing of traumatic narratives to avoid re-traumatization."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When mapping the 'N' (Neurobiological Impact) in Advanced Case Conceptualization, a specialist identifies a client frequently stuck in a 'Dorsal Vagal' state. What is the primary clinical presentation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is associated with the 'freeze' or 'faint' response, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and a drop in physiological arousal, unlike the Sympathetic state which drives 'fight or flight'."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of 'Titration' within the Narrative Integration (H) phase of the ANCHOR framework?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client remembers every detail of the trauma in one session",
                "To keep the client in a state of high arousal to facilitate purging",
                "To slow down the processing of traumatic material into small, manageable 'drops'",
                "To skip the emotional aspects and focus only on the facts of the event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is a safety protocol that involves breaking down traumatic memories into small pieces so the client's nervous system can process the information without becoming overwhelmed or flooded."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that premature exposure to traumatic memories without sufficient somatic stabilization (Calibration) leads to significantly higher dropout rates, often cited between 35-40%, due to autonomic flooding."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal zone of arousal where a person is able to function and process information effectively without becoming hyper-aroused or hypo-aroused."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resilience Engineering is a proactive approach that builds internal and external architecture to help the client navigate future stressors with flexibility, rather than just reacting to symptoms."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client moves outside their Window of Tolerance (hyperarousal), the specialist must pause narrative work and return to Somatic Calibration (C) to re-establish safety and physiological regulation."
