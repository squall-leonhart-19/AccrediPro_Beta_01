            "options": [
                "Specialists focus on diagnosing PTSD, while clinicians focus on prescribing medication.",
                "Specialists support functional recovery and nervous system regulation, while clinicians diagnose and treat clinical mental health disorders.",
                "There is no functional difference; the titles are interchangeable in a trauma-informed setting.",
                "Specialists are permitted to process deep-seated childhood trauma, while clinicians focus only on current symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The specialist's scope is focused on recovery support, stabilization, and functional goals. Diagnosis and the treatment of DSM-5 clinical disorders remain the exclusive domain of licensed mental health clinicians."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "In the context of Trauma-Informed Informed Consent, what does the 'Right to Pause' signify?",
            "options": [
                "The specialist can stop a session if the client is not making progress.",
                "The client must give 24 hours notice before pausing a recovery program.",
                "An explicit agreement that the client can halt any exercise or conversation at any moment without justification.",
                "The legal requirement to pause sessions if a mandatory reporting event occurs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Right to Pause' is a cornerstone of client agency, ensuring the client feels in control of their own nervous system and the pace of the session."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "When practicing somatic-based recovery, what is the ethical 'Gold Standard' for physical touch?",
            "options": [
                "Touch is never permitted under any circumstances in trauma recovery.",
                "Touch is allowed as long as the specialist has signed a general liability waiver.",
                "Touch should only be used if the specialist senses the client is 'dissociating'.",
                "Explicit, verbal, and 'retractable' consent must be obtained before any physical contact, even if previously permitted."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Somatic ethics require ongoing, explicit consent. Because trauma survivors may have 'fawn' responses, consent must be reaffirmed and the client must know they can retract it at any time."

        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A specialist is working with a client from a marginalized community. Which action best demonstrates 'Cultural Humility'?",

                "Researching the client's culture and assuming all members of that culture share the same trauma responses.",
                "Engaging in continuous self-critique and acknowledging the power imbalance inherent in the practitioner-client relationship.",
                "Telling the client that 'trauma is universal' to minimize the impact of systemic oppression.",
                "Referring the client to a different specialist solely based on their race or ethnicity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility involves a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and fixing power imbalances, rather than just achieving a finished state of 'competence'."

        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "Why is addressing Vicarious Trauma (VT) considered an *ethical* duty rather than just a personal wellness choice?",
            "options": [
                "Because VT is a billable condition in most insurance frameworks.",
                "Because specialists with VT are more likely to experience 'Empathy Fatigue,' which can lead to clinical errors and client harm.",
                "Because the law requires specialists to take at least 4 weeks of vacation per year.",
                "Because VT is contagious and can be passed to the client during somatic work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unaddressed vicarious trauma impairs the specialist's judgment, reduces their ability to hold space safely, and increases the risk of ethical violations or boundary blurring."
        },

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical risk of 'Narrative Flooding' in the early stages of trauma recovery?",
            "options": [
                "The client might run out of things to talk about in future sessions.",
                "The specialist might get bored with the details of the story.",
                "It can cause 'retraumatization' by over-activating the nervous system before the client has adequate stabilization skills.",
                "It violates the client's privacy by forcing them to share secrets."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pacing is an ethical requirement. Pushing for a full narrative before a client is stabilized can lead to flooding, which reinforces the trauma rather than resolving it."

            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "To avoid 'Dependency' during the termination phase, what should a specialist emphasize?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of ethical trauma recovery is to empower the client's agency and self-efficacy, ensuring they do not become dependent on the specialist for emotional regulation."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Under the 'Duty to Warn' (Tarasoff) principle, when is a specialist legally mandated to breach confidentiality?",
            "options": [
                "When a client admits to using illegal substances.",
                "When a client expresses vague frustration with a family member.",

                "Immediately refer and facilitate a transition to emergency services or a clinical crisis team.",
                "Ask the client to sign a 'no-harm' contract and continue the recovery session.",
                "Keep the information confidential to maintain the 'safe container' of the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active suicidality is outside the scope of a recovery specialist and requires immediate clinical intervention to ensure the client's safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "Which statistic regarding Vicarious Trauma (VT) highlights the importance of the 'Ethical Duty to Self-Care'?",
            "options": [
                "Studies show that up to 50% of trauma professionals experience high levels of secondary traumatic stress.",
                "Only 5% of specialists ever experience burnout.",
                "Self-care has been proven to have no impact on client outcomes.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High rates of secondary traumatic stress (STS) among practitioners (often cited between 40-70% in various studies) make self-care a professional necessity to maintain the standard of care."
