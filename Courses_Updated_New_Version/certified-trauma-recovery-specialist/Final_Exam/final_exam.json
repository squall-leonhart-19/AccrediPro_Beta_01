            "question": "In the A.N.C.H.O.R. Framework™, which phase specifically focuses on utilizing psychoeducation to de-stigmatize symptoms as adaptive survival responses rather than pathological defects?",
            "options": [
                "Acknowledge Impact",
                "Normalize Response",
                "Calibrate System",
                "Optimize Resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Normalize Response' phase (N) is designed to reframe trauma symptoms—such as hypervigilance or dissociation—as natural, adaptive survival responses to unnatural events, reducing client shame and self-stigma."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic hyperarousal, a high resting heart rate, and frequent 'flash-forwards' to potential threats. According to the 'Calibrate System' phase, what is the primary physiological objective?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive restructuring of the threat narrative",
                "Cathartic emotional release of stored trauma",
                "Stabilization of the autonomic nervous system via somatic grounding",
                "Integration of the traumatic memory into a coherent timeline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Calibrate System' phase (C) prioritizes somatic grounding and regulation techniques to stabilize the autonomic nervous system (ANS), moving the client out of a state of sympathetic dominance before deeper processing occurs."

        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "When facilitating the 'Honor Narrative' (H) phase, what is the most critical safety consideration to prevent re-traumatization?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pacing is essential in the 'Honor Narrative' phase. Working within the 'Window of Tolerance' ensures the client can process the trauma without becoming overwhelmed (hyperarousal) or shutting down (hypoarousal)."

        {
            "id": "final_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma often involves a total loss of power. Collaborative goal setting is a therapeutic intervention that restores agency and empowers the client as the 'expert' of their own life."
