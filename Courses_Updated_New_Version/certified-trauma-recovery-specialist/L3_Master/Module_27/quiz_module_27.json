                "Moral injury involves a threat to life, while PTSD involves a threat to ego",
                "Moral injury stems from a transgression of deeply held beliefs or expectations, rather than just fear-based trauma",

                "It prevents the transmission of trauma from mother to child",
                "It is only found in individuals who have experienced direct physical abuse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FKBP5 gene is involved in the regulation of the body's stress response system (HPA axis); epigenetic changes to this gene can be passed down, making offspring more susceptible to stress disorders."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Birth trauma often involves the loss of the expected bonding experience; when medical necessity forces separation during the 'Golden Hour,' it can lead to feelings of failure, grief, and disrupted attachment."

                "The high cost of internet access",
                "The 'permanence' and 24/7 accessibility of the digital footprint and the abuse",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike physical events that have a clear beginning and end, digital trauma (like doxing or non-consensual image sharing) can feel 'evergreen' and inescapable, preventing the nervous system from reaching a state of safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because high-performers are often rewarded for their 'workaholic' or 'perfectionist' trauma responses, coaches may miss the depth of their suffering, assuming that professional success equals psychological health."
