                "The shift from symptom management to the integration of trauma into a cohesive, empowered identity.",
                "The complete elimination of all physiological triggers and flashbacks.",
                "The strict adherence to cognitive reframing techniques without somatic involvement.",
                "The transition from professional support to total self-reliance without a social network."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mastery-level synthesis involves moving beyond mere stabilization (symptom management) to integrating the traumatic experience into a new, empowered sense of self."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced somatic calibration is marked by high HRV and 'vagal flexibility'—the ability of the nervous system to move fluidly between states and recover quickly from stressors."

            "options": [
                "Narrative Mastery focuses on forgetting the details of the trauma.",
                "It involves the client becoming the 'Author' of their story, transforming the trauma into a catalyst for meaning and purpose.",
                "It requires the practitioner to write the client's new story to ensure it is positive.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative Mastery is an existential process where the survivor moves from being a character in a tragedy to the author of a story characterized by agency and post-traumatic growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced integration focuses on 'Self-Leadership,' where the core Self coordinates and harmonizes various internal parts (or 'sub-personalities') rather than exiling or silencing them."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners use their own regulated SES to provide co-regulation, acting as a safe anchor that helps the client's nervous system learn to feel safe in connection."

                "As a lack of motivation or compliance from the client.",
                "As a protective mechanism signaling that the current intervention exceeds the system's capacity for safety.",

                "As a personality flaw that needs to be challenged aggressively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In master-level practice, resistance is seen as a 'protective self' mechanism. It is data that indicates the client's nervous system does not yet feel safe enough to proceed with the current approach."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious Resilience is the 'flip side' of vicarious trauma; it is the inspiration and personal growth practitioners gain from witnessing the strength and recovery of their clients."
