            "question": "According to the ICD-11, what specific triad of symptoms distinguishes Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) from standard PTSD, collectively known as Disturbances in Self-Organization (DSO)?",
            "options": [
                "Flashbacks, avoidance, and hypervigilance",
                "Affect dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal disturbances",
                "Amnesia, depersonalization, and derealization",
                "Substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidal ideation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While C-PTSD includes the core PTSD symptoms, it is defined by the DSO triad: difficulties regulating emotions, persistent feelings of worthlessness or shame, and sustained difficulties in maintaining relationships."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the Theory of Structural Dissociation, what is the primary characteristic of the 'Emotional Personality' (EP) part of the personality?",
            "options": [
                "It handles the tasks of daily life such as work and social interaction",
                "It is usually avoidant of traumatic memories to maintain functionality",
                "It holds the traumatic memories and remains 'stuck' in defensive survival sub-systems",
                "It is the rational, logical part that mediates between the client and the therapist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The EP (Emotional Personality) represents the part of the personality that is fixated in the trauma, carrying the sensory and emotional weight of the event and remaining in a state of fight, flight, or freeze."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "During an acute crisis intervention, what is the primary goal of the 'De-escalation' phase when a client is in a state of hyper-arousal?",
            "options": [
                "To process the underlying childhood trauma that triggered the event",
                "To establish a long-term treatment plan and medication schedule",
                "To reduce autonomic arousal and return the client to their Window of Tolerance",
                "To challenge the client's cognitive distortions regarding the crisis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In an acute crisis, the immediate priority is stabilization. This involves lowering physiological arousal to move the client back into their Window of Tolerance where they can access rational thought."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Research into high-risk behaviors suggests that 'No-Suicide Contracts' are less effective than 'Safety Planning.' Why is Safety Planning preferred in trauma-informed care?",
            "options": [
                "Safety plans are legally binding documents that protect the practitioner",
                "Safety plans provide a collaborative, tiered set of coping strategies and resources",
                "No-suicide contracts are too difficult for clients with C-PTSD to understand",
                "Safety plans focus exclusively on pharmacological interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety Planning is a collaborative process that empowers the client with specific, actionable steps (internal coping, social support, professional resources) rather than just a promise not to act, which can feel coercive."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "When managing 'Personality Adaptations' (often diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder), a trauma-informed specialist views 'splitting' primarily as:",
            "options": [
                "A manipulative tactic used to gain control over the therapeutic environment",
                "A biological deficiency in the prefrontal cortex unrelated to trauma",
                "A protective survival mechanism used to manage unbearable internal conflict",
                "A sign that the client is not ready for trauma recovery work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care views personality 'disorders' as adaptations. Splitting (black-and-white thinking) is a survival mechanism used to simplify a world that felt dangerously unpredictable during development."

            "id": "q28_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Self-Medication Hypothesis posits that individuals use specific substances to manage specific distressing symptoms, such as using alcohol to dampen hyperarousal or stimulants to counter dissociative numbing."

                "Increasing the dosage of psychiatric medications over time",
                "Slowly exposing the client to small 'drops' of traumatic material to prevent flooding",
                "The process of moving between a resource and a traumatic memory",
                "Combining multiple therapeutic modalities in a single session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the processing of trauma, working with very small pieces of the memory at a time to ensure the client stays within their Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark sign of 'Vicarious Trauma' (as opposed to general burnout) in a trauma specialist?",

                "Feeling tired and wanting to change careers",
                "A fundamental shift in the specialist's world-view and sense of safety",

                "Increased physical fitness and focus on personal health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout is related to work stress and exhaustion, Vicarious Trauma specifically involves a shift in the practitioner’s cognitive schemas—their fundamental beliefs about safety, trust, and the world—due to empathetic engagement with trauma survivors."

            "id": "q28_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Structural Dissociation involves one ANP (Apparently Normal Personality) and multiple EPs (Emotional Personalities), which is the typical structure found in C-PTSD and BPD."

            "id": "q28_10",

            "options": [
                "Immediate hospitalization to prevent further harm",
                "Terminating the session until the client can remain safe",
                "Curiously and non-judgmentally exploring the 'function' the behavior served for the client",
                "Ignoring the behavior to avoid reinforcing it through attention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A trauma-informed approach seeks to understand the behavior as a coping mechanism. By exploring the 'function' (e.g., grounding, affect regulation), the specialist can help the client find safer alternatives."
