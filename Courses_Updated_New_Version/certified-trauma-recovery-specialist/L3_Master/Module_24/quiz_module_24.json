            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners use mapping to understand the complex, non-linear interplay between various systemic factors rather than just identifying a list of symptoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by the 'shutdown' response of the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to numbness, lethargy, and reduced physiological activation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ANP is the part of the personality that handles 'normal' daily functioning and often attempts to avoid or ignore the traumatic memories held by the Emotional Parts (EP)."
