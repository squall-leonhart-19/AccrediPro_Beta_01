            "options": [
                "To acknowledge the presence of trauma and establish initial safety",
                "To map the internal landscape and identify specific triggers and somatic responses",
                "To process the trauma narrative using cognitive-behavioral techniques",
                "To optimize long-term resilience through community integration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Navigate' phase focuses on internal mapping, helping clients identify their unique triggers, nervous system states, and somatic signals before moving into deeper processing."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "In Curriculum Mapping (Lesson 3), why is it considered a 'safety violation' to introduce cognitive reframing of a trauma narrative before achieving somatic stabilization milestones?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive reframing is less effective than somatic work in the long run",
                "Without somatic stabilization, cognitive processing can trigger a 'top-down' hijack and lead to re-traumatization",
                "The ANCHOR Framework™ does not allow for cognitive interventions until the final week",
                "Insurance providers do not reimburse for cognitive work done in the first month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma recovery must follow a 'Bottom-Up' sequence; attempting to process trauma cognitively while the nervous system is dysregulated can cause the client to exceed their Window of Tolerance."

                "Ignoring the energy and continuing with the planned curriculum to maintain structure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collective co-regulation via grounding exercises allows the facilitator to stabilize the group's collective nervous system without shaming individual participants."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Optimize' phase is about long-term success, moving the client from a state of being supported to a state of self-efficacy and sustainable self-regulation."

            "options": [
                "The total number of participants who completed the program",
                "The percentage of participants who liked the program",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While p-values tell you if a result is statistically significant, Effect Size measures the magnitude or 'strength' of the improvement, which is critical for evidence-based practice."
