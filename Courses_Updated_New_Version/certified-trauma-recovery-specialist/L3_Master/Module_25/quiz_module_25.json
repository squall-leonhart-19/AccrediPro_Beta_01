            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Parallel Process is a core concept in supervision where the supervisee's experience with the client is reflected in the supervision dynamic, allowing the supervisor to model trauma-informed responses."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Complementary countertransference occurs when the supervisor takes on a role that 'complements' the supervisee's or client's internal dynamics (e.g., becoming the 'good parent' the client never had)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vicarious liability (Respondeat Superior) holds that a supervisor is responsible for the actions of a supervisee if a supervisory relationship exists and the supervisor has the power to direct the work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed evaluation is collaborative; starting with self-assessment empowers the supervisee and reduces the power-imbalance that can trigger defensive or trauma-based responses."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Groupthink is a risk where the desire for cohesion leads members to avoid challenging each other, which can be dangerous when evaluating high-risk trauma cases."
