        {
            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "In the context of quantum physics as discussed in Lesson 1, the Akashic Field is most scientifically analogous to which concept?",
            "options": [
                "The Theory of General Relativity",
                "The Zero-Point Field (ZPF)",
                "Newtonian Mechanics",
                "The Doppler Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Zero-Point Field represents the lowest possible energy state of a quantum mechanical system and is considered the 'plenum' or vacuum state that holds the information of all existence, mirroring the Akashic concept."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Why is Heart Rate Variability (HRV) emphasized in Lesson 2 as a tool for 'Bio-Energetic Calibration'?",
            "options": [
                "It measures the physical strength of the heart muscle.",
                "It is a primary indicator of autonomic nervous system balance and physiological coherence.",
                "It determines the client's blood pressure during a reading.",
                "It is used to predict the duration of the Akashic session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV and coherence indicate that the practitioner is in a state of 'physiological grace,' allowing them to act as a stable 'tuning fork' for the Akashic frequencies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, which cognitive mechanism is the primary component of the 'Egoic Filter' that can distort channeled information?",
            "options": [
                "Confirmation Bias",
                "Neuroplasticity",
                "The Placebo Effect",
                "Lucid Dreaming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Confirmation bias leads a practitioner to interpret Akashic data in a way that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or the client's expectations, rather than receiving the raw truth of the Field."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Sacred Space' is defined not just as a physical location, but as a 'Containment Field.' What is the primary function of this field?",
            "options": [
                "To trap the client's energy so they cannot leave.",
                "To increase the practitioner's psychic power by 50%.",
                "To create a stable frequency environment protected from external 'psychic noise' or interference.",
                "To ensure the room is aesthetically pleasing for marketing purposes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Containment ensures that the energetic environment is 'sealed' and calibrated to a specific frequency, allowing for clear communication without external energetic contamination."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 describes the breath as a 'Bridge.' How does intentional rhythmic breathing (like the 4-7-8 technique) affect the Vagus Nerve?",
            "options": [
                "It deactivates the Vagus Nerve to stop digestion.",
                "It stimulates the sympathetic nervous system for a 'fight or flight' response.",
                "It stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, inducing a state of calm receptivity necessary for access.",
                "It has no measurable effect on the nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vagal stimulation through rhythmic breathing shifts the body into a parasympathetic state, which lowers the 'noise' of the physical body and opens the channel to the Akasha."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When two individuals enter the 'Shared Field' (Lesson 6), what phenomenon occurs that allows the practitioner to sense the client's information?",
            "options": [
                "Telepathic Eavesdropping",
                "Energetic Entrainment",
                "Hypnotic Suggestion",
                "Psychological Projection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment occurs when two oscillating systems (practitioner and client) begin to vibrate in harmony, creating a 'Third Field' where information can flow between them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Under the 'Ethical Alignment' guidelines in Lesson 7, why is 'Implicit Permission' generally insufficient for a professional reading?",
            "options": [
                "It is not legally binding in a court of law.",
                "It violates the Law of Sovereignty and can create 'karmic entanglement' for the practitioner.",
                "It makes the session too short.",
                "It prevents the practitioner from charging a full fee."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Akashic Records operate on the principle of free will; accessing someone's soul record without explicit, conscious permission is an ethical breach that can distort the data and impact the practitioner's alignment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A practitioner experiences 'Post-Session Fatigue' and feels 'heavy' after a client leaves. Which step of the Lesson 8 Integration Protocol was most likely skipped?",
            "options": [
                "The Opening Prayer",
                "The Client Intake Form",
                "Energetic Disconnection and Grounding",
                "Setting the Session Timer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-session fatigue is often a result of 'energetic tethering,' where the practitioner fails to consciously disconnect from the client's field and ground their own energy back to their center."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "The 'Observer Effect' in quantum physics (Lesson 3) teaches Akashic Practitioners that:",
            "options": [
                "The act of observing the Records has no impact on the information received.",
                "The Records are fixed and cannot be changed.",
                "The consciousness of the practitioner influences the 'collapse' of the information into a specific message.",
                "Clients should keep their eyes closed during the entire session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Observer Effect suggests that the practitioner's intent and focus actually help shape how the non-local information of the Akasha manifests as specific insights."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "In the 'Alignment Protocol' (Lesson 8), what is the purpose of the 'Vertical Alignment' visualization?",
            "options": [
                "To make the practitioner appear taller to the client.",
                "To connect the practitioner's energy to both the Earth (grounding) and the Source/Cosmos (receptivity).",
                "To check if the practitioner's spine is straight.",
                "To visualize the client's future bank account balance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vertical alignment ensures the practitioner is a clear, grounded conduit, preventing them from becoming 'spacey' while remaining open to high-frequency information."
