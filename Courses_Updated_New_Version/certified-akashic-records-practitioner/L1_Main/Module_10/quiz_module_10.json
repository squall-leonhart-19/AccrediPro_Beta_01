                "Ego questions are always asked in a loud voice",
                "Soul Truth inquiries only deal with future predictions",
                "Ego questions are only asked by the practitioner, never the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Static or blocks are often signs of a frequency mismatch; re-calibrating the vessel allows the practitioner to clear the channel and resume the flow."
