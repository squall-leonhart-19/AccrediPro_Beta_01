            "question": "In the context of the Quantum Architecture of the Akasha (L1), what is the primary function of the 'A-Field' as described by quantum theorists like Ervin Laszlo?",
            "options": [
                "A physical library located in the 5th dimension",
                "An informed field of non-local information that stores every event and thought in the universe",
                "A biological database stored within the human DNA sequence",
                "A collective subconscious mind limited to human experiences only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The A-Field (Akashic Field) is defined in quantum architecture as a non-local, informed field that acts as a cosmic memory bank for all existence, not just human history."

            "question": "During 'Step A: Precision Alignment' (L2), why is achieving heart-brain coherence considered a prerequisite for accessing the Records?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the practitioner's physical strength",
                "It allows the practitioner to bypass the need for an invocation",
                "It creates a stable vibrational frequency that matches the high-frequency state of the Akasha",
                "It is only necessary for beginners, not advanced practitioners"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequency calibration via heart-brain coherence ensures the practitioner's energetic signature is high enough to 'tune in' to the Akashic frequency without distortion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Soul-led inquiries focus on 'What' or 'How' to facilitate growth and understanding of the soul's evolution, rather than predictive or ego-based 'Yes/No' questions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Invocation acts as a key to the 'gate,' establishing a sacred container and ensuring the practitioner has the necessary permission to access the specific soul blueprint."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healing transmutation involves reframing the narrative at a soul level, which neutralizes the emotional charge and breaks the cycle of karmic repetition."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In 'Step A: Anchoring' (L7), the practitioner helps the client create an 'Integration Action Plan.' Why is this step critical for 3D reality?",
            "options": [
                "Without 3D action, the high-frequency insights of the Akasha may fail to manifest as tangible life changes",
                "It is a legal requirement for all practitioners",
                "It allows the practitioner to charge more for the session",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "options": [
                "Access the third party's Records anyway if it helps the client",
                "Guess the information based on the client's energy",
                "Refuse the request, as accessing another's Records without explicit permission violates the Practitioner's Code",
                "Only access the third party's Records if they are a family member"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical governance mandates 'Informed Consent.' Accessing the Records of a non-consenting adult is a violation of energetic sovereignty and the practitioner's code."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "In a case study from Lesson 5, a client repeatedly attracts 'emotionally unavailable' partners. Which Akashic step is most effective for identifying the 'Origin Point' of this pattern?",

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "The 'Observer Effect' in quantum physics suggests that the act of observing a particle changes its behavior. How does this apply to an Akashic Reading?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner's presence has no impact on the Records",
                "The Records are static and can never be changed",
                "The practitioner’s conscious witness of a karmic pattern can initiate the process of shifting that pattern",
                "It means the practitioner should keep their eyes closed the entire time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Akasha, 'witnessing' a soul's truth acts as a catalyst; the conscious observation of a karmic loop by both practitioner and client begins the transmutation process."
