            "question": "In the philosophy of Akashic Inquiry, what is the primary function of a well-crafted question?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a definitive 'yes' or 'no' answer regarding the future",
                "To act as a navigational tool that steers the session's energy and focus",
                "To prove the practitioner's psychic abilities to the client",
                "To satisfy the practitioner's intellectual curiosity about the client's past"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Questions are viewed as navigational tools; they do not just seek information but actually direct the flow of energy and determine which 'files' of the Akashic Records are opened."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which of the following characteristics distinguishes an 'Ego-based' question from an 'Essence-based' question?",
            "options": [
                "Ego-based questions seek growth, while Essence-based questions seek comfort",
                "Ego-based questions are always about other people, never the self",
                "Ego-based questions seek prediction, control, or external validation",
                "Ego-based questions are too complex for the Akashic Records to answer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ego-based questions typically stem from a desire for certainty, control over others, or validation of a specific outcome, whereas Essence-based questions seek alignment and soul growth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Why is the syntax of a question (how it is built) critical in an Akashic session?",
            "options": [
                "The Records only respond to specific ancient linguistic patterns",
                "Closed-ended questions can limit the depth of information and disempower the client",
                "Proper grammar is required to maintain a high-vibrational connection",
                "It determines how much the practitioner can charge for the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The structure of the question determines the breadth of the response. Closed-ended questions (Yes/No) often shut down the energetic flow and prevent the client from receiving the nuanced wisdom needed for transformation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'surface symptom' of chronic procrastination. Using the 'Root Cause Identification' technique (L4), what should the practitioner focus on?",
            "options": [
                "Giving the client a time-management schedule",
                "Asking the Records for the exact date the procrastination will stop",
                "Tracing the emotional charge behind the resistance to identify the underlying fear or contract",
                "Telling the client they simply need more discipline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Root cause identification involves 'peeling the onion' to move past the symptom (procrastination) to the underlying energetic or soul-level cause (such as a fear of failure or a past-life vow)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "According to the energetics of inquiry, why is 'How' or 'What' often more powerful than 'Why'?",
            "options": [
                "The word 'Why' has a low numerical frequency in numerology",
                "'Why' often leads to intellectualization and a victim mindset, whereas 'How/What' leads to empowerment and action",
                "'Why' is considered disrespectful to the Masters and Teachers",
                "There is no difference; all question words are energetically identical"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'Why' questions tend to keep a client in their head, searching for reasons that may lead to excuses. 'How' and 'What' questions shift the energy toward solution, alignment, and the mechanics of change."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When conducting Specialized Inquiry into relationships, what is the most productive perspective to take?",
            "options": [
                "Viewing the other person as the source of the client's problems",
                "Asking the Records to change the other person's behavior",
                "Viewing the relationship as a mirror to understand the client's own soul lessons and patterns",
                "Seeking to find out if the other person is a 'Twin Flame' or 'Soulmate'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Records, relationships are viewed as mirrors. Inquiry should focus on what the relationship is revealing to the client about their own growth, triggers, and evolution."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Iterative Inquiry' (The Art of the Follow-Up)?",
            "options": [
                "To catch the client in a lie",
                "To refine and deepen the exploration based on the energy of the previous response",
                "To ensure the session lasts the full 60 minutes",
                "To ask as many questions as possible in a short amount of time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iterative inquiry is the process of using the information received in one answer to formulate a deeper, more specific follow-up question, allowing for a more profound 'unfolding' of the Record."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "During Collaborative Inquiry (L8), a client asks: 'Should I leave my husband?' How should the practitioner help the client reframe this?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client that the Records don't answer marriage questions",
                "Reframe to: 'What is the highest growth path for me within this marriage, and what is holding me back from clarity?'",
                "Reframe to: 'Will I be happier if I leave him?'",
                "Change the question to: 'What is my husband doing wrong?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The practitioner should help the client move from a disempowered 'Should I' (seeking external permission) to an empowered inquiry about growth, clarity, and the energetic dynamics at play."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Abundance Inquiry,' what does it mean to ask about the 'frequency' of wealth rather than the 'amount'?",
            "options": [
                "Asking for a specific dollar amount is forbidden in the Records",
                "Inquiring about the internal state of being and alignment that allows abundance to flow",
                "Asking how many times per week money will arrive",
                "Focusing only on spiritual wealth and ignoring physical money"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Abundance is an energetic frequency. Inquiry that focuses on the internal alignment and the removal of blocks to that frequency is more effective than simply asking for a specific number."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A 2022 internal study on practitioner efficacy suggested that sessions with 'High-Quality Inquiry' resulted in a 40% higher rate of client-reported 'breakthroughs.' What was the defining factor of 'High-Quality Inquiry'?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner asked at least 20 questions per hour",
                "The questions were pre-written by the practitioner before meeting the client",
                "The questions focused on 'Essence' and 'Root Cause' rather than 'Ego' and 'Symptoms'",
                "The practitioner used a specific script for every client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-quality inquiry is defined by its ability to bypass surface-level ego concerns and target the root cause and the soul's essence, leading to more sustainable and profound client breakthroughs."
