            "question": "What is the fundamental difference between an Akashic 'Reading' and Akashic 'Transmutation' as defined in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "A Reading is for entertainment, while Transmutation is for professional practitioners only.",
                "A Reading focuses on information retrieval, while Transmutation focuses on shifting the energetic signature of the Record.",
                "Transmutation requires physical tools like crystals, whereas a Reading is purely mental.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in the AccrediPro methodology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transmutation goes beyond simply identifying 'what happened' (Reading) to actively changing the frequency and energetic impact of that information on the client's current life."

                "The recurring 'story arc' or theme that dictates the client's current limiting beliefs.",
                "The names of the client's biological ancestors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Soul Narrative is the underlying 'script' or story the soul has been following, often characterized by a specific theme like 'I am always betrayed' or 'I must suffer to be holy.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Karmic loops persist because a lesson remains unlearned. By identifying the Seed Event and extracting the wisdom, the 'debt' is balanced and the loop dissolves."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of Seven' is a standard in ancestral clearing, reflecting both ancient wisdom and modern epigenetic studies suggesting trauma impacts lineage for seven generations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consent is paramount in transmutation. The client's conscious will acts as the 'key' that allows the practitioner to facilitate shifts in the Records."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rescinding requires the client's conscious participation to acknowledge why the vow was made (e.g., for spiritual devotion) and to formally declare it null and void in the present."
