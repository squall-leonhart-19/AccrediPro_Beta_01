            "options": [
                "It focuses primarily on the legal aspects of running a spiritual business.",
                "It involves the practitioner relinquishing the 'fixer' archetype to honor the client's ultimate soul autonomy while maintaining a 100% neutral container.",
                "It requires the practitioner to take responsibility for the client's emotional processing after the session.",
                "It is the process of asking the Masters for permission before every single question asked during a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical Sovereignty at the Master level means moving beyond 'helping' and into 'holding'—maintaining an impeccable, neutral frequency that honors the client's path without ego-driven intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vibrational drag occurs when a practitioner attempts to access higher-dimensional data (7D-9D) without the necessary internal frequency alignment, leading to fatigue or 'energetic fog' in the 3D body."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alchemy requires 3D participation. A blueprint rewrite remains 'fluid' until the client anchors it through a conscious, physical-world action that contradicts the old pattern."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level branding requires the practitioner to avoid the 'Guru Trap,' instead positioning themselves as a conduit that empowers the client's own sovereignty."
