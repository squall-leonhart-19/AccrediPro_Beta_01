            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Supervision requires a 'meta-perspective' where the supervisor's primary 'client' is the supervisee’s growth, ensuring they maintain the integrity of the protocol while developing their own professional 'voice'."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triple-loop learning goes beyond 'doing things right' (single) or 'doing the right things' (double) to 'how do we decide what is right?'—challenging the practitioner’s fundamental mindset."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual Narcissism in mentorship occurs when the mentor views their channel as the 'gold standard,' inadvertently stifling the unique intuitive development of the mentee."
