            "options": [
                "The business and the founder share the exact same Akashic Record until the business is incorporated.",
                "The business is a distinct energetic entity with its own destiny, separate from the founder's personal Record.",
                "Business Records can only be accessed by those with a legal majority stake in the company.",
                "The Record of a business is purely transactional and lacks the emotional depth of a human Record."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Akashic theory, once a business is conceived, it forms its own 'Soul of Enterprise'—a distinct energetic blueprint with its own path and purpose that is independent of the founder’s personal soul journey."

                "Domesticated animals are unable to access the Akashic field due to human interference.",
                "Domesticated animals often develop more individualized Records due to their proximity to human consciousness, while wild animals operate primarily through a Group Soul Record.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Domesticated animals often differentiate from their species' Group Soul because their close relationships with humans foster unique personality traits and specific soul lessons recorded individually."

            "question": "The 'Ancestral Mastery' lesson teaches the healing of the 7 Generations. According to the module, why is the 4th generation often considered a 'pivot point' in inherited trauma?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is the furthest back a human can remember their ancestors.",
                "Because energetic patterns often reach peak density or 'crystallization' after three generations of repetition.",
                "Because the 4th generation is where the DNA completely resets.",
                "Because the Akashic Records do not store data beyond 100 years."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that unresolved trauma often intensifies through three generations, making the 4th generation a critical 'pivot point' where the pattern must either be healed or it will become a deeply ingrained 'ancestral debt'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creative Midwifery treats the project as an entity that 'wants' to be born; the practitioner facilitates the alignment between the creator and the project's inherent purpose."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners read the 'energetic blueprint'—the emotional and spiritual precursors to health—but must never cross into medical diagnosis or prescribing, maintaining a clear professional boundary."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical mastery requires that practitioners respect the sovereignty of all souls; accessing the Records of a third party without their consent is a violation of Akashic ethics."
