            "question": "A potential client requests a reading to understand why their partner is being distant. According to the professional ethics covered in L1, what is the correct response?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with the reading as it involves the client's life experience.",
                "Refuse the request unless the partner provides explicit, informed consent.",
                "Access the partner's records only to see how they impact the client's energy.",
                "Charge a higher fee for a 'Third-Party' energetic assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual ethics require explicit permission to access an individual's Akashic Records. Accessing a third party's records without consent is a violation of energetic boundaries and professional standards."

            "question": "When 'Crafting Your Signature Akashic Offering' (L2), what is the primary reason for shifting from 'pay-per-hour' to 'transformation-based' packages?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to work fewer hours for the same money.",
                "It prevents clients from canceling individual sessions.",
                "It anchors the energetic exchange in the result rather than the time spent.",
                "It is a requirement for professional liability insurance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transformation-based packages focus on the soul-level shift and the value of the outcome, which creates a more stable energetic container for the client's growth compared to transactional hourly billing."

        {
            "id": "q30_3",
            "question": "In the 'Client Journey' (L3), why is the 24-72 hour window post-reading considered critical for integration?",
            "options": [
                "This is the period of 'neuro-energetic recalibration' where the client is most sensitive.",
                "It is the legal cooling-off period for refund requests.",
                "The Records remain open for exactly 72 hours after a session ends.",
                "It is the only time a practitioner is allowed to send a follow-up email."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 24-72 hour window is when the information received in the Records begins to filter through the client's mental and emotional bodies, often resulting in 'integration symptoms' or profound realizations."

                "Using high-pressure scarcity tactics to force a decision.",
                "Ensuring your marketing copy matches the frequency of your actual session work.",
                "Posting 5 times a day to ensure maximum algorithm visibility.",
                "Only marketing to people who have already had an Akashic reading."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Marketing with integrity means your external messaging is an energetic match for the internal experience of your work. This resonance naturally attracts clients who are aligned with your specific frequency."

            "id": "q30_5",
            "question": "In L5, 'poverty consciousness' in a spiritual practice is often manifested as 'under-pricing.' What is a common energetic consequence of this?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner gains more clients due to the lower barrier to entry.",
                "The client feels they are getting a bargain and respects the practitioner more.",
                "An energetic 'debt' or resentment grows, leading to practitioner burnout.",
                "The Records provide more information to compensate for the lower price."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under-pricing creates an energetic imbalance where the practitioner gives more than they receive, leading to resentment, exhaustion, and an unsustainable practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Legal protection requires a clear distinction that spiritual work is not a replacement for professional medical, legal, or financial advice."

            "question": "When scaling a practice through 'Group Records' (L7), how does the energetic field differ from a 1:1 session?",
            "options": [
                "The field is weaker because the energy is divided among many people.",
                "A 'Mastermind' or 'Collective Field' is created, often amplifying the healing power.",
                "The practitioner must open the Records for each person individually during the call.",
                "Group sessions are less effective because the Masters cannot focus on everyone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group work utilizes the power of the collective. The shared intention of the group creates a synergistic field that can facilitate deep breakthroughs that might not occur in isolation."

            "id": "q30_8",
            "question": "L8 emphasizes 'Energetic Hygiene.' What is the recommended practice for a practitioner immediately after closing a client's Records?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately check emails to return to the physical world.",
                "Keep the client's energy in your field for 24 hours to support them.",

                "Drink a caffeinated beverage to boost energy levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grounding and clearing are essential to separate the practitioner's energy from the client's and the Akashic field, ensuring the practitioner does not carry the client's burdens."

            "id": "q30_9",
            "question": "A client has started messaging you daily with 'urgent' questions between sessions. Which concept from L1 and L3 should be applied?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Daily messaging often indicates a client is looking for the practitioner to take responsibility for their life choices (an energetic hook). Setting firm boundaries protects both parties and encourages client sovereignty."

            "id": "q30_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Sustaining the Practitioner' lesson (L8), what is the primary indicator that a practitioner is 'leaking' energy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic exhaustion and brain fog are classic signs of energetic leakage, often caused by poor boundaries, lack of clearing, or an unsustainable exchange of energy."
