            "options": [
                "Single sessions focus on deep soul evolution while journeys focus on immediate crisis management.",
                "Journeys prioritize the 'Soul Blueprint' over the client's immediate ego-driven requests.",
                "Single sessions are for ancestral clearing, while journeys are for past-life regression only.",
                "Journeys are designed to move from 'symptom-patching' to 'sustainable frequency shifts' over a structured timeline."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes that transformational journeys provide the structure necessary for sustainable frequency shifts, whereas single sessions often act as temporary 'symptom-patching' without long-term integration."

                "Soul Goals align with the Akashic Records' blueprint for expansion, regardless of the personality's comfort.",
                "Soul Goals are set by the practitioner, while Ego Goals are set by the client.",
                "Soul Goals must be achieved within the first 3 sessions of a protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Soul Goal is an objective aligned with the soul's inherent blueprint and evolution, which may sometimes challenge the personality's (ego's) desire for safety or status quo."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'K' stands for Knowledge, which involves accessing the Records to understand the origin, karmic lessons, and mechanics of the client's current limitations."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When identifying 'Root-Seed Patterns' (L4), why is it critical to find the 'Seed' incarnation rather than just any past life?",

                "The Seed incarnation is the only one that can be cleared.",
                "The Seed incarnation represents the original point of entry for the energetic distortion, allowing for complete transmutation.",
                "The Seed incarnation is always the most recent past life.",
                "It is a legal requirement for Akashic certification."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Root-Seed is the primary origin point. Addressing the 'Seed' ensures that the practitioner isn't just trimming 'branches' (secondary manifestations) but pulling the pattern out at its source."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transmutation is the process of changing the 'lead' of trauma into the 'gold' of soul wisdom by shifting its vibrational frequency within the Akashic field."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Anchoring Feedback Loop ensures that Akashic insights are translated into 3D actions, preventing 'spiritual bypass' where the client feels good in the session but changes nothing in their life."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Harmony (H) involves stabilizing the new energetic state across the physical, emotional, and mental bodies to prevent 'healing crises' before the final Anchoring (A) into 3D reality."
