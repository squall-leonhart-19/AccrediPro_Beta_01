            "question": "In the context of Ancestral Epigenetics (L1), what is the primary mechanism by which 'Seven Generations of Scarcity' is typically transmitted through the Akashic field?",
            "options": [
                "Random soul selection based on karmic debt",
                "Epigenetic tagging where trauma-induced gene expression is passed through the morphic field",
                "A physical inheritance of biological markers only, independent of the soul's record",
                "A conscious decision by the ancestors to punish future generations for their failures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 teaches that scarcity patterns are often 'tagged' in the lineage's morphic field, where the Akashic Record reflects the epigenetic expression of ancestral trauma across generations."

            "question": "When addressing Chronic Somatic Manifestations (L2), a client presents with persistent tension in the throat (5th Chakra area) that has no medical cause. In the Akashic-Body Connection, this most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "A past life vow of silence or suppressed truth in the ancestral line",
                "A lack of physical exercise and poor posture",
                "A future timeline where the client is a public speaker",
                "A soul contract involving a high-conflict romantic partner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic markers in the throat often correlate with suppressed expression, frequently traced to 'Vows of Silence' or ancestral patterns where speaking one's truth was dangerous."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the 'Sacred Purpose' of a high-conflict soul contract in a relationship?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the individuals remain together for eternity",
                "To punish the soul for misdeeds in a parallel life",
                "To act as a 'Catalyst Mirror' for rapid soul growth and the resolution of karmic loops",
                "To provide a distraction from the client's corporate career goals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-conflict contracts are designed as intense catalysts that force the soul to address unhealed aspects of the self through the 'mirror' of the other person."

                "The individual records of every customer the company has ever served"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Egregore is the collective energetic entity of an organization, which has its own unique record within the Akashic field, distinct from the individuals within it."

            "id": "q16_5",

            "options": [
                "To delete the memory of the trauma entirely",
                "To find the fragmented 'essence' and reintegrate it into the current timeline to restore wholeness",
                "To move the client into a parallel life where the trauma never happened",
                "To create new fragments to help the client cope with future stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soul Retrieval focuses on identifying the point of fragmentation (trauma) and calling back that aspect of the soul's essence to the current 'Now' moment for energetic completion."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "When navigating Multidimensional Paradoxes (L6), how should a practitioner interpret a client seeing themselves as a 'healer' in one parallel life and a 'warrior' in another?",
            "options": [
                "The client is confused and should pick one identity",
                "One life is 'real' and the other is a hallucination",
                "These are simultaneous expressions of the soul's multifaceted nature, offering different skill sets for integration",
                "The warrior life must be cleared as it is inherently negative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel lives are simultaneous expressions. Integrating the 'warrior's' strength with the 'healer's' compassion allows for a more potent multidimensional mastery in the current life."

                "A Dark Night is always caused by ancestral scarcity",
                "A Dark Night involves the total dissolution of the old ego-identity to make way for a higher-vibrational soul alignment",
                "A Dark Night can be resolved in a single 15-minute Akashic session",
                "A Dark Night is a sign that the practitioner has made a mistake in the protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dark Night is a profound spiritual transition where the ego's structures collapse so the soul can emerge more fully; it requires deep 'holding space' rather than a quick fix."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Within the A.K.A.S.H.A. Protocol (L8), what does the 'S' stand for, and what is its function?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the A.K.A.S.H.A. Protocol, the 'S' stands for Shift, which is the core phase where the practitioner facilitates the actual transmutation of the energetic record."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A case study involving a 'Vow of Poverty' (L1 & L8) shows a client consistently losing money despite a high income. What is the final step in the Mastery Integration to ensure this doesn't recur?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'A' in the AKASHA protocol stands for Anchoring. For a Shift to be permanent, the new frequency must be grounded into the client's daily reality through consistent physical action."

                "A random series of events that have no connection to the present",
                "Only the outcomes that the practitioner wants to see"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Records reflect probability. By seeing the most likely future timeline, the client gains the 'Quantum Choice' to either stay the course or shift their vibration to select a different outcome."
