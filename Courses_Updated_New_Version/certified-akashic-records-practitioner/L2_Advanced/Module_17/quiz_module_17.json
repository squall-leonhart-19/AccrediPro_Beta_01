            "question": "When working with 'Fragmented Soul Narratives' in Lesson 1, what is the primary indicator that a client is experiencing a 'dissociative bypass' during a Record reading?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to cry uncontrollably and expresses deep grief.",
                "The client describes past-life events in a detached, third-person cinematic way without emotional resonance.",
                "The Records provide highly detailed dates and locations for historical events.",
                "The client experiences physical warmth and tingling in their extremities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In L2 trauma work, describing events as a 'movie' without feeling indicates a dissociative bypass, where the soul fragment is observed but not yet integrated into the client's current energetic field."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client with 'Highly Intellectual Ego Resistance' (Lesson 2) repeatedly asks for 'proof' of the Records' accuracy. Which L2 technique is most effective for bypassing this critical factor?",
            "options": [
                "Providing more historical data to satisfy the intellect.",
                "Ending the session immediately as the client is not 'ready.'",
                "The Somatic Bridge: Shifting the focus from 'what do you think' to 'where do you feel that in your body right now.'",
                "Arguing with the client about the nature of quantum reality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Bridge bypasses the analytical mind (the 'Critical Factor') by grounding the session in immediate physical sensation, which the ego cannot easily rationalize away."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what distinguishes an 'Ancestral Knot' from a standard personal past-life karmic debt?",
            "options": [
                "An Ancestral Knot only affects the first-born male of a lineage.",
                "An Ancestral Knot is a repeating pattern observed across at least three generations of the biological or soul lineage.",
                "Ancestral Knots can only be cleared by visiting the client's physical birthplace.",
                "There is no difference; they are treated with the same L1 protocols."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L2 practitioners identify Ancestral Knots by recognizing patterns (e.g., poverty, betrayal, or specific illnesses) that echo through multiple generations, requiring a lineage-clearing protocol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Entity Attachment), what is the 'Sovereignty Declaration' protocol primarily used for?",
            "options": [
                "To banish the entity into a dark void.",
                "To ask the Keepers of the Records to take over the client's free will.",
                "To re-establish the client's energetic authority and revoke any unconscious 'contracts of consent' that allowed the interference.",
                "To protect the practitioner from catching the entity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entity interference often relies on 'unconscious consent' (vows of suffering, etc.). The Sovereignty Declaration uses the client's free will to revoke that consent within the Records."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "If the Records are 'Silent' or Non-Responsive (Lesson 5), and the practitioner has confirmed their own alignment is clear, what is the most likely 'Sacred Pacing' reason?",
            "options": [
                "The client has been banned from the Records by the Lords of Karma.",
                "The information requested would cause 'healing crisis' trauma that the client's nervous system cannot yet regulate.",
                "The practitioner's internet connection is interfering with the Akashic frequency.",
                "The Records only open on specific lunar cycles for that client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Records have an inherent 'safety valve.' If the client's nervous system isn't ready to integrate a specific trauma, the Records will remain silent to prevent re-traumatization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "When working with terminal illness (Lesson 6), what is the primary goal of the 'Transition Grace' protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To facilitate a 'miracle cure' and reverse the physical illness.",
                "To identify who is to blame for the client's illness in a past life.",
                "To resolve 'unfinished business' and energetic cords to the physical plane, allowing for a peaceful soul transition.",
                "To convince the client to stay alive longer for their family's sake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L2 practitioners in end-of-life scenarios focus on 'soul-level closure,' helping the client release regrets and earthly attachments to facilitate a graceful transition."

        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7's case study of a high-conflict relationship, why is 'Cord Cutting' often ineffective without first addressing the 'Original Vow'?",
            "options": [
                "Cords are made of indestructible etheric matter.",
                "The cord will simply grow back if the underlying soul contract or 'Vow' that feeds the connection remains active in the Records.",
                "Cord cutting can only be done by the client, not the practitioner.",
                "The Records do not allow cord cutting in high-conflict scenarios."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cords are symptoms of a deeper agreement. In L2 work, we must nullify the 'Original Vow' (e.g., 'I will never leave you, no matter what') before the energetic separation can be permanent."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on sustainability, what is the 'Empathic Strain' statistic regarding practitioners who do not use 'Energetic Decoupling'?",
            "options": [
                "90% of practitioners quit within the first year.",
                "Practitioners experience a 40% increase in cortisol levels when 'taking on' client trauma rather than witnessing it.",
                "Empathic strain only affects practitioners who are not 'naturally gifted.'",
                "The statistic shows that empathy actually increases physical health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into practitioner burnout shows that 'empathic resonance' without 'decoupling' leads to significant physiological stress, including a measurable 40% rise in cortisol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Generational Curse' of financial ruin. In Lesson 3, what is the first step in the 'L2 Lineage Clearing' process?",
            "options": [
                "Telling the client to donate money to clear their karma.",
                "Identifying the 'Progenitor' (the ancestor where the pattern originated) and the specific trauma that created the knot.",
                "Performing a generic abundance ritual.",
                "Asking the client to stop speaking to their living relatives."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To clear a generational pattern, the practitioner must go to the 'root'—the Progenitor—to understand the original event that set the energetic momentum in motion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, what percentage of 'energetic interferences' are classified as 'Self-Generated Thought-Forms' rather than external entities?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Approximately 85%",
                "100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L2 training emphasizes that roughly 85% of what clients perceive as 'entities' are actually 'Thought-Forms'—concentrated energetic patterns created by their own repetitive negative beliefs and trauma."
