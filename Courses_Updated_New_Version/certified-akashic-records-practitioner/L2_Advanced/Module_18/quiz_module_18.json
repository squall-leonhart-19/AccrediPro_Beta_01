                "To keep the client in a trance state for the duration of the 28-day cycle.",
                "To prioritize ancestral data over soul data to ensure physical healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the art of taking complex, multi-dimensional information and weaving it into a cohesive, grounded narrative that the client can actually use to change their life."

                "The final prayer used to close the Records during a Master-level session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Red Thread is the core soul theme—such as 'The Silent Witness' or 'The Reluctant Leader'—that appears repeatedly in the Records across different lifetimes and contexts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lineage Convergence occurs when the soul chooses a specific biological family because their ancestral 'baggage' or 'gifts' match the soul's current evolutionary requirements."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical contracts involve 'Double Binds' where two spiritual truths or vows conflict, such as a vow of poverty taken for 'holiness' vs. a current soul mission requiring 'abundance' to reach the masses."

                "The client forgets the reading entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Days 7-14 are often the most difficult, as the old identity (ego) fights back against the new energetic blueprint being integrated into the nervous system."

                "Refusing to work with clients who have ancestral trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Signature Integration is the 'Synthesis' of the practitioner's own unique genius and professional background with the Akashic process to create a bespoke healing experience."

                "The names of the people who betrayed them in 14th-century France.",
                "A way to punish the souls who committed the betrayal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis focuses on how the 'Betrayed Healer' theme manifests as a current-life blockage, such as an irrational fear of marketing or public speaking (visibility)."

            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "Why does the 28-day cycle prioritize 'Neuroplasticity' in Akashic work?",
            "options": [
                "Because the Records are located in the cerebellum.",
                "Because lasting transformation requires the physical brain to wire new pathways that support the energetic shift made in the Akasha.",
                "Because it takes 28 days for the soul to leave the body and return.",
                "Because neuroplasticity is the only way to communicate with the Council of Elders."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without neural integration, the 'Aha!' moment of a reading remains a fleeting peak experience rather than a sustained life transformation."
