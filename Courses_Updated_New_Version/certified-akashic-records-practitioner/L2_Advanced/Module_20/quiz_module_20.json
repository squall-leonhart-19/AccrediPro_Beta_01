                "To predict the client's future outcomes based on current energy",
                "To establish a baseline frequency and identify immediate psychic interference",
                "To force the client into a deep trance state regardless of their comfort",
                "To determine the specific cost of the healing session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pre-Access Energetic Audit is designed to stabilize the client's field, identify 'noise' or interference, and establish a baseline frequency to ensure clear communication with the Records."

                "A question that the practitioner answers themselves without the Records"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Root Queries are high-level diagnostic questions that cut through the client's narrative or 'story' to access the underlying energetic cause within the Akasha."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frequency Deviation measures the gap between the Soul's Blueprint (its original, pure design) and its current energetic state, often caused by trauma, vows, or karma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High ATI scores (8-10) indicate significant energetic fragmentation; practitioners must stabilize the field and clear the acute trauma before attempting more advanced integration work."

                "Increasing the client's social media presence immediately",
                "Clearing the Vow of Silence while addressing the underlying trauma that necessitated the vow",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In synthesis, the practitioner must address the 'Contractual' cause (the vow) and the 'Energetic' impact (the trauma score) simultaneously to ensure the blockage does not return."
