            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "Within the N.A.T.U.R.E. Framework™ for multi-systemic autoimmunity, what does the 'U' represent in the clinical assessment phase?",
            "options": ["Universal Precautions", "Underlying Triggers and Toxins", "Urinary Organic Acid Testing", "Unilateral Immune Response"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the N.A.T.U.R.E. Framework™, 'U' stands for Underlying Triggers and Toxins, which involves identifying latent infections (EBV, Lyme), heavy metals, or mold that may be driving the autoimmune process."

        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Advanced Metabolic Dysfunction, which ratio is considered a high-sensitivity surrogate marker for insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk?",
            "options": ["LDL/HDL ratio > 3.0", "Triglyceride/HDL ratio > 3.0", "Total Cholesterol/HDL ratio > 5.0", "Albumin/Globulin ratio < 1.0"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Triglyceride/HDL ratio greater than 3.0 (in mg/dL) is a strong predictor of insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles, indicating high cardiovascular synergy."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In cases of chronic neuro-inflammation, the 'M1' phenotype of microglia is associated with which of the following?",
            "options": ["Anti-inflammatory cytokine production", "Tissue repair and debris clearance", "Pro-inflammatory signaling and neurotoxicity", "Promotion of axonal regrowth"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Microglia in the M1 state are 'primed' or classically activated, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, TNF-alpha) that can lead to chronic neurodegeneration if not resolved."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Robert Naviaux’s 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR) theory suggests that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is primarily a result of:",
            "options": ["A permanent deficiency in ATP production enzymes", "The mitochondria shifting from energy production to cellular defense", "A psychological aversion to physical exertion", "Excessive thyroid hormone uptake by the mitochondria"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CDR theory posits that mitochondria shift their function from oxidative phosphorylation (energy) to cellular defense (stiffening membranes, signaling danger) when they perceive a threat, leading to systemic fatigue."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When treating recalcitrant GI disorders with suspected biofilms, which agent is specifically used as a 'thiol-based' biofilm disruptor?",
            "options": ["Oregano Oil", "Berberine", "Bismuth-thiol complex", "Apple Cider Vinegar"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bismuth-thiol complexes (often combined with ALA or DMPS) are advanced biofilm disruptors that penetrate the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of the biofilm more effectively than standard herbs."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the context of 'Complex Hormonal Cascades,' how does chronic systemic inflammation typically affect thyroid physiology?",
            "options": ["It increases the conversion of T4 to T3", "It decreases the production of Reverse T3 (rT3)", "It downregulates deiodinase type 1 (D1) and increases rT3", "It stimulates TSH production to supra-physiological levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inflammation and high cortisol inhibit the D1 enzyme (which converts T4 to T3) and promote the D3 enzyme, which converts T4 into the metabolically inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "A hallmark lab finding in Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) due to mold exposure is a deficiency in which hormone?",
            "options": ["Cortisol", "Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (MSH)", "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)", "Progesterone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low MSH is a core diagnostic marker in CIRS, leading to issues with sleep (low melatonin), increased pain sensitivity, and leaky gut."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In integrative oncology support, the 'Warburg Effect' refers to the tendency of cancer cells to:",
            "options": ["Migrate to the bones via the lymphatic system", "Preferentially use aerobic glycolysis for energy, even in the presence of oxygen", "Undergo apoptosis when exposed to high-dose Vitamin C", "Enter a state of dormancy during chemotherapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Warburg Effect describes how cancer cells switch to glucose fermentation (glycolysis) for energy even when oxygen is available, which supports the rationale for metabolic/ketogenic interventions."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in geriatric patients with sarcopenia, what is the recommended daily protein intake range?",
            "options": ["0.6 - 0.8 g/kg body weight", "0.8 - 1.0 g/kg body weight", "1.2 - 1.5 g/kg body weight", "2.5 - 3.0 g/kg body weight"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elderly patients require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.5 g/kg) to stimulate muscle protein synthesis due to age-related anabolic resistance."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A patient presents with brain fog, multiple chemical sensitivities, and chronic bloating. HLA-DR testing is positive for mold susceptibility. What is the most critical first step in the clinical protocol?",
            "options": ["Starting high-dose antifungal medication", "Aggressive heavy metal chelation", "Removal of the patient from the damp/contaminated environment", "Strict elemental diet for 14 days"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In environmental illness (CIRS/Mold), the 'Step 1' is always removal from exposure. Without removing the trigger, binders and antifungals will have limited or temporary efficacy."
