            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'OR' operator is used to broaden a search by including articles that contain any of the specified terms, which is ideal for synonyms."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In a clinical trial, what is the primary purpose of 'Intent-to-Treat' (ITT) analysis?",
            "options": [
                "To exclude participants who did not follow the protocol strictly",
                "To ensure the results only reflect the most compliant patients",
                "To maintain the benefits of randomization by including all participants as originally assigned, regardless of dropout",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ITT analysis includes all participants who were randomized, which prevents bias caused by dropouts and better reflects real-world clinical practice."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "If a study reports a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for a Relative Risk (RR) of 0.85 to 1.15, what does this indicate about the statistical significance of the result?",
            "options": [
                "The result is statistically significant because the range is narrow",
                "The result is not statistically significant because the interval includes 1.0",
                "The intervention is 85% effective in all populations",
                "The intervention is 15% more effective than the placebo"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For ratios (like Relative Risk or Odds Ratio), if the confidence interval crosses 1.0, it indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the groups."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A study on a probiotic supplement shows an Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) of 5% for developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. What is the Number Needed to Treat (NNT)?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NNT is calculated as 1 / ARR. In this case, 1 / 0.05 = 20. This means 20 patients need to be treated for one person to benefit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Enzyme induction speeds up the metabolism of the drug, clearing it from the body faster and reducing its effectiveness."
