            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beneficence requires the practitioner to act in the best interest of the client. Continuing an ineffective treatment for financial gain fails to provide benefit and prioritizes the practitioner's interest over the client's wellness."

                "'I am prescribing this herbal protocol to treat your chronic fatigue syndrome.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To remain within scope in unlicensed areas, practitioners must avoid 'diagnosing,' 'treating,' or 'prescribing' for specific diseases, focusing instead on 'supporting,' 'optimizing,' and 'educating' the client's health terrain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioner vitality is an ethical duty; burnout or 'compassion fatigue' directly correlates with decreased quality of care, increased errors, and a breakdown in professional boundaries."

                "Post the photos anonymously without the client's consent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To avoid being 'misleading' under marketing regulations, practitioners must ensure the depiction is accurate and provide a clear disclosure that the specific results shown may not be experienced by all users."
