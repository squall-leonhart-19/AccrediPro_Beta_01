            "question": "When mapping multi-system dysfunction in L1, which concept refers to the primary physiological 'bottleneck' or imbalance that triggers cascading effects across multiple body systems?",
            "options": [
                "Symptomatic Branch",
                "Upstream Driver",
                "Secondary Sequelae",
                "Peripheral Manifestation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Upstream Driver is a core imbalance (like gut dysbiosis or HPA-axis dysfunction) that leads to multiple downstream symptoms. Identifying this is key to advanced pattern recognition."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Autoimmune Intersection' (L2) and Fassano's Triad, which three factors must coincide for an autoimmune disease to manifest?",
            "options": [
                "Viral load, heavy metals, and low Vitamin D",
                "Chronic stress, high cortisol, and thymic involution",

                "Molecular mimicry, T-cell exhaustion, and B-cell overactivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fassano's Triad posits that autoimmunity requires a genetic susceptibility, an environmental trigger (like a pathogen or toxin), and the loss of intestinal barrier function."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In the context of Polypharmacy (L3), why is St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) considered high-risk for clients taking medications like Warfarin or Cyclosporine?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6",
                "It induces the CYP3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein, accelerating drug clearance",
                "It increases the half-life of medications by blocking renal excretion",
                "It displaces medications from albumin binding sites in the blood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, which can significantly lower the blood levels and efficacy of many critical medications."

                "Direct viral invasion of the prefrontal cortex",
                "Excessive production of melatonin in the pineal gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sickness behavior is an integrated immune-to-brain communication where peripheral cytokines signal the CNS to induce behavioral changes that conserve energy for the immune response."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "When managing 'Stealth Infections' and Mycotoxins (L5), what is the primary purpose of the 'Bust and Bind' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate the immune system and then suppress it with herbs",
                "To increase stomach acid and then neutralize it with alkaline minerals",
                "To disrupt protective biofilms and then sequester the released toxins/pathogens with binders",
                "To kill bacteria and then repopulate the gut with high-dose probiotics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Bust and Bind' strategy uses biofilm disruptors to expose hidden pathogens or toxins, followed by binders (like charcoal or clay) to prevent reabsorption and 'herxheimer' reactions."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, which blood marker ratio is identified as a highly sensitive clinical predictor of insulin resistance and atherogenic dyslipidemia when it exceeds 3.0?",
            "options": [
                "LDL to HDL ratio",
                "Total Cholesterol to Triglyceride ratio",

                "Glucose to Insulin ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Triglyceride/HDL-C ratio > 3.0 (in mg/dL) is a strong surrogate marker for insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client presents with sudden 'thunderclap' headache, facial drooping, and difficulty speaking. According to Ethical Stewardship (L7), what is the practitioner's immediate responsibility?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Naturopathic practitioners must recognize clinical 'Red Flags' that fall outside their scope or require urgent medical intervention; neurological emergencies require immediate ER referral."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "Within the N.A.T.U.R.E. Framework™ (L8), what does the 'U' represent in the sequence of clinical integration?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'U' in N.A.T.U.R.E. stands for Unburden, which involves removing the obstacles to cure, such as environmental toxins, stealth infections, and chronic emotional stressors."

            "options": [
                "Aggressive Detox → Biofilm Busting → Emunctory Support",
                "Emunctory/Drainage Support → Gentle Binding → Pathogen Eradication",
                "High-dose Probiotics → Heavy Metal Chelation → Fasting",
                "Antibacterial Herbs → Liver Flush → Mineral Replacement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, the 'drainage pathways' (liver, kidneys, lymph, colon) must be open and supported before releasing toxins or pathogens to avoid systemic toxicity."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A 2023 analysis of metabolic health (L6) suggests that what percentage of the US adult population is considered 'metabolically unhealthy' based on markers like waist circumference and blood pressure?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Recent data, including studies from the University of North Carolina, indicate that only about 12% of US adults are metabolically healthy, meaning over 88% show metabolic complexity."
