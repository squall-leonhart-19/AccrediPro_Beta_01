                "To focus solely on the client's primary symptomatic complaint"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis involves moving beyond a list of symptoms to create a 'Unified Pathophysiological Narrative,' which identifies the underlying connections between various systems (e.g., how gut dysbiosis is driving skin inflammation)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic Cross-Talk involves the 'leaky gut-leaky brain' axis, where inflammatory mediators like IL-6 and TNF-alpha enter systemic circulation and affect neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter balance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unburdening focuses on removing significant toxic loads or obstacles—such as heavy metals or environmental toxins—that prevent the body's homeostatic mechanisms from functioning correctly."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the 'Unburden' phase, we must remove the physiological stressor (SIBO/food triggers) before the body can effectively respond to 'Restore' strategies like adrenal support."
