            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "Within the N.A.T.U.R.E. Framework™, what is the primary objective of the first step, 'Notice Patterns'?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately prescribe a botanical protocol based on the client's chief complaint.",
                "To assess the client's unique physical constitution, temperament, and comprehensive health history to identify recurring physiological themes.",
                "To perform a heavy metal detox to clear the 'terrain' before assessment.",
                "To educate the client on the sustainability of naturopathic medicine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Notice Patterns (N) is about deep observation and data collection. It involves looking beyond symptoms to understand the client's constitution and history, allowing the practitioner to see the 'big picture' before moving into analysis."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and post-exertional malaise. Using the 'Analyze Root Causes' (A) phase, which biochemical process should be investigated first to address cellular energy production?",
            "options": [
                "The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone.",
                "The efficiency of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain and oxidative phosphorylation.",

                "The secretion of secretory IgA in the gut mucosa."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In metabolic health and bioenergetics (Module 12), chronic fatigue is often rooted in mitochondrial dysfunction. Analyzing the Electron Transport Chain efficiency is critical for understanding the root cause of low ATP production."

        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "In the 'Unburden Systems' (U) phase, why is it critical to ensure bowel regularity and optimal bile flow before initiating a systemic 'heavy metal' or 'pathogen' cleanse?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the 're-circulation' of toxins (enterohepatic circulation) and reduce the risk of a Herxheimer reaction.",
                "To ensure the client loses weight during the detoxification process.",
                "To increase the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins during the cleanse.",
                "To suppress the immune system's inflammatory response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Unburdening systems (Module 4) requires opening 'drainage pathways' first. If the bowels are sluggish, toxins liberated during a cleanse can be reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, leading to systemic toxicity and acute symptoms."

                "High insulin levels steal pregnenolone to create more glucose.",
                "Thyroid hormone inhibits the conversion of pregnenolone to testosterone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the adrenal glands prioritize the production of cortisol (survival) over sex hormones (reproduction), 'stealing' the precursor pregnenolone and leading to hormonal imbalances such as progesterone deficiency."

                "Intestinal permeability (leaky gut) can lead to systemic inflammation that manifests as skin barrier disruption.",
                "Skin conditions are exclusively caused by external environmental pollutants.",
                "Dermatological issues are unrelated to the microbiome."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut-skin axis is a well-documented phenomenon where intestinal dysbiosis and permeability trigger systemic immune responses that exacerbate inflammatory skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis."

                "75% of the participants were cured of cardiovascular disease."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Hazard Ratio of 0.75 indicates a 25% reduction in the risk (1.0 - 0.75 = 0.25) of the event occurring in the treatment group compared to the control group."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is critical for restoring balance (Module 5) as it is a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes, vital for mitochondrial function (ATP), and helps modulate the body's stress response."

        {
            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Red Flag' symptom that requires an immediate referral to a medical doctor or emergency services (Module 28: Crisis & Complex Cases)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethics in naturopathy require transparency. When a dual relationship is unavoidable, the practitioner must discuss boundaries with the client and document how the professional relationship will be maintained."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IgE-mediated allergies are immediate and can be life-threatening (anaphylaxis). Intolerances (like lactose intolerance) usually involve the inability to digest a substance and do not involve the same immune pathway."
