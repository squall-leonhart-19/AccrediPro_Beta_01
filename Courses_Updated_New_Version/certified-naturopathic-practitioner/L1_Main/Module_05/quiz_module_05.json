            "question": "In naturopathic philosophy, what is the primary distinction between 'homeostasis' and 'homeodynamics' as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Homeostasis is a static state of equilibrium, while homeodynamics recognizes the body as a system in a constant state of flux and adaptation.",
                "Homeostasis refers only to temperature regulation, while homeodynamics refers to fluid balance.",
                "Homeostasis is a term used for the Vital Force, while homeodynamics describes physical biochemistry.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Homeodynamics is the preferred term in advanced naturopathy because it acknowledges that the 'set points' of the body are constantly shifting in response to internal and external stressors, rather than being static."

            "question": "According to Bruce Ames' 'Triage Theory' (2008) mentioned in Lesson 2, how does the body respond to a moderate micronutrient deficiency?",
            "options": [
                "It distributes remaining nutrients equally across all physiological systems.",
                "It prioritizes the most 'expensive' metabolic pathways to ensure they don't fail.",
                "It prioritizes short-term survival and reproduction at the expense of long-term health and DNA repair.",
                "It increases the absorption rate of all minerals by 400% to compensate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triage Theory suggests that during deficiency, the body allocates nutrients to proteins essential for immediate survival, leading to 'insidious' damage (like DNA breaks) that manifests as chronic disease later in life."

            "question": "A practitioner is following the 5R protocol for gut restoration. Which specific nutrients are most appropriate during the 'Repair' phase to support mucosal integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Hydrochloric acid and Pepsin",
                "L-Glutamine, Zinc Carnosine, and Aloe Vera",

                "Oregano oil and Berberine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Repair' phase focuses on healing the intestinal lining. L-Glutamine is the primary fuel for enterocytes, while Zinc Carnosine and demulcents like Aloe Vera support the structural integrity of the mucosal barrier."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Which adaptogen is specifically indicated for a client experiencing 'hypocortisolism' (exhaustion phase) who requires support for the HPA axis without over-stimulation?",
            "options": [
                "Panax Ginseng (Asian Ginseng)",

                "Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licorice root inhibits the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone, thereby extending the half-life of the body's own cortisol in cases of depletion."

            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the 'Cortisol Awakening Response' (CAR). What is considered a healthy CAR percentage increase within 30-45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "A 5-10% increase",

                "A 150-200% increase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR is typically a 50% to 75% increase over the waking value. A 'flat' CAR is often associated with chronic fatigue, burnout, or PTSD."

            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 6), which state is characterized by low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and the activation of the unmyelinated dorsal vagal complex?",
            "options": [
                "Social Engagement (Ventral Vagal)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The dorsal vagal response is an evolutionary primitive 'freeze' or 'shutdown' state that occurs when the nervous system perceives a life-threatening threat that cannot be escaped via fight or flight."

            "options": [
                "To provide immediate energy for the brain.",
                "To trigger the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter (SGLT1) for rapid water absorption.",
                "To improve the taste and ensure client compliance.",
                "To stimulate insulin, which pulls potassium into the cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SGLT1 transporter in the small intestine requires both sodium and glucose to move water across the intestinal wall into the bloodstream via osmotic gradient."

            "question": "A client presents with chronic insomnia and high evening blue light exposure. Which physiological mechanism is being disrupted by the blue light?",
            "options": [
                "The destruction of adenosine in the basal forebrain.",
                "The suppression of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells, inhibiting melatonin release.",
                "The overproduction of GABA in the prefrontal cortex.",
                "The premature activation of the glymphatic system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Short-wavelength blue light (approx. 480nm) specifically targets melanopsin receptors in the eye, which signal the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) to suppress melatonin production from the pineal gland."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which clinical sign is most indicative of successful 'Vagal Tone' restoration in a client who previously suffered from chronic anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in resting heart rate.",
                "A decrease in pupillary light reflex speed.",
                "An increase in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and improved digestive motility.",
                "A decrease in the production of secretory IgA."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Higher HRV is a proxy for robust vagal tone and parasympathetic dominance. Since the vagus nerve also controls the 'rest and digest' functions, improved motility is a secondary sign of nervous system regulation."
