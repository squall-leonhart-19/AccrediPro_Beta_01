            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (HPA Axis dysfunction), which hormone is primarily sacrificed to prioritize the production of cortisol during chronic stress?",
            "options": ["Aldosterone", "Progesterone", "Insulin", "Glucagon"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes cortisol production, often 'stealing' the precursor pregnenolone away from the production of progesterone and DHEA, leading to reproductive imbalances."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis highlighted that Berberine, at a dosage of 500mg three times daily, showed comparable efficacy to which pharmaceutical intervention for blood sugar regulation?",
            "options": ["Lisinopril", "Metformin", "Atorvastatin", "Levothyroxine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine has been shown in multiple clinical trials to be as effective as Metformin in reducing HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels by activating AMPK."
        },

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, which botanical is identified as a 'dual-action' herb capable of supporting both adrenal resilience and the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola rosea", "Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha)", "Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice)", "Fucus vesiculosus (Bladderwrack)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is unique in its ability to lower cortisol while simultaneously supporting thyroid function by increasing the conversion of T4 to the more active T3 hormone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "According to the N.A.T.U.R.E. framework discussed in Lesson 8, what does the 'U' represent in the clinical management of endocrine disorders?",
            "options": ["Underlying Pathology", "Unburdening Toxins", "Upregulating Enzymes", "Universal Supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'U' in the N.A.T.U.R.E. framework stands for Unburdening, specifically focusing on the removal of environmental endocrine disruptors and metabolic waste."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "When addressing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) through clinical nutrition, what is the physiologically ideal ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol for restoring insulin sensitivity and ovulation?",
            "options": ["1:1", "10:1", "40:1", "100:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the plasma ratio found in healthy individuals and is considered the gold standard for PCOS nutritional therapy."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which specific environmental toxin, commonly found in plastic linings and thermal receipts, acts as a xenoestrogen by binding to estrogen receptors and disrupting the HPG axis?",
            "options": ["Glyphosate", "Bisphenol A (BPA)", "Mercury", "Lead"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA is a well-documented xenoestrogen that mimics estradiol, leading to estrogen dominance and potential reproductive health issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In the 'Seed Cycling' protocol for reproductive balance, which seeds are recommended during the Follicular Phase (Days 1-14) to support estrogen metabolism?",
            "options": ["Sesame and Sunflower", "Pumpkin and Sesame", "Flax and Pumpkin", "Flax and Sunflower"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flax and pumpkin seeds are used in the follicular phase; flax contains lignans to bind excess estrogen, while pumpkin seeds are high in zinc to support FSH production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which chronic hyperinsulinemia contributes to 'Estrogen Dominance' in overweight patients?",
            "options": ["Upregulation of Aromatase in adipose tissue", "Inhibition of the Liver's Phase II detoxification", "Destruction of the Corpus Luteum", "Suppression of the Pituitary gland"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Excess insulin stimulates the enzyme aromatase in adipose (fat) tissue, which converts androgens into estrogens, worsening the hormonal imbalance."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A patient presents with a 'Flat Cortisol Curve' on a 4-point salivary test, complaining of 'tired but wired' feelings at night. Which intervention is most appropriate for 'Stewardship' of their circadian rhythm?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training at 8:00 PM", "Blocking blue light 2-3 hours before sleep", "Consuming caffeine only after 12:00 PM", "Taking 10mg of Melatonin at noon"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blocking blue light helps preserve natural melatonin production, which is essential for correcting the circadian rhythm and the cortisol awakening response."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Which trace mineral is a mandatory cofactor for the Type 1 and Type 2 deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 into the biologically active T3 hormone?",
            "options": ["Magnesium", "Selenium", "Copper", "Manganese"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is essential for the deiodinase enzymes; without sufficient selenium, the body cannot effectively convert inactive T4 into active T3, regardless of TSH levels."
