            "options": [
                "The client becomes a passive recipient of natural supplements",
                "The client transitions from seeking external 'fixes' to taking internal ownership of their biological terrain",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stewardship defines the client as the 'Guardian' of their health, shifting the focus from passive consumption of care to active management and ownership of their biological environment."

            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses Circadian Stewardship. What is the role of 'Adenosine' in the sleep-wake cycle?",
            "options": [
                "It is a hormone produced by the pineal gland to induce REM sleep",
                "It is a byproduct of cellular energy use that builds 'sleep pressure' throughout the day",
                "It is a neurotransmitter that triggers the 'fight or flight' response in the morning",
                "It is a mineral required for the synthesis of melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adenosine builds up in the brain the longer we are awake, creating sleep pressure. Stewardship involves managing this through timing caffeine and sleep."
