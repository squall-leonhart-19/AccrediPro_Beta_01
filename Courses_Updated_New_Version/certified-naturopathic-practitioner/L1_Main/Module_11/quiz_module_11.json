            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Naturopathic endocrinology views the system as a complex web where the HPA, HPT, and HPG axes are deeply interconnected; a shift in one inevitably affects the others."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is unique for its ability to support thyroid function (increasing T4) while lowering cortisol and supporting the HPA axis."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are endocrine disruptors that possess a structural similarity to 17β-estradiol, allowing them to bind to and activate estrogen receptors inappropriately."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
