            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Notice Patterns' phase within the CNP framework?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a definitive medical diagnosis for pharmaceutical intervention",
                "To identify the underlying terrain and energetic state before pathology manifests",
                "To replace laboratory testing with purely intuitive assessment",
                "To focus exclusively on the client's primary symptomatic complaint"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Notice Patterns' phase is designed to identify the 'terrain'—the underlying constitutional and energetic state—allowing the practitioner to see the direction of health before it crystallizes into a named disease."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Phlegmatic' temperament. According to modern naturopathic synthesis, which physiological tendency is most associated with this profile?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid metabolic turnover and high sympathetic nervous system activity",
                "A tendency toward acute inflammatory 'explosions' and high acidity",
                "Slower metabolic rate, lymphatic congestion, and a need for warming/circulatory support",
                "Extreme sensitivity to light and sound with a high catabolic rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Phlegmatic temperament is characterized by the element of Water/Earth, correlating with slower metabolism, increased mucus production, and a tendency toward lymphatic stagnation."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "During a tongue assessment, you notice prominent 'scalloped' or crenulated edges. This indicator is most commonly associated with:",
            "options": [
                "Excessive stomach acid and heat in the upper burner",
                "Spleen Qi deficiency and fluid metabolism imbalances causing the tongue to swell",
                "A recent history of high-dose antibiotic use",
                "Severe Vitamin B12 deficiency resulting in atrophy of the papillae"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scalloped edges (teeth marks) indicate that the tongue is swollen and pressing against the teeth, which in naturopathic and TCM terms signifies Spleen Qi deficiency or 'dampness' (fluid stagnation)."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Vertical ridges on the fingernails, when present across all ten digits, are most clinically significant for indicating:",

                "Excessive intake of fat-soluble vitamins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vertical ridges are often a sign of 'leaky gut' or malabsorption, frequently stemming from hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid) which prevents the breakdown of proteins and minerals."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In the context of Constitutional Mapping, the 'Miasmatic' influence refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The current environmental toxins the client is exposed to",
                "Inherited predispositions or 'genetic shadows' that dictate how a body reacts to stress",
                "The specific bacterial colony currently residing in the gut microbiome",
                "The atmospheric conditions present at the time of the clinical interview"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Miasms represent the inherited blueprint or 'taint' that influences the body's constitutional weakness and its specific style of reacting to disease."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A client reports waking consistently between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM with a feeling of 'tired but wired' restlessness. This rhythmic pattern often suggests:",
            "options": [
                "Optimal melatonin production and deep REM cycles",
                "Kidney exhaustion and low evening cortisol",
                "Liver detoxification peaks or blood sugar dysregulation (hypoglycemia)",
                "Excessive calcium accumulation in the pineal gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the Chinese Organ Clock and modern chronobiology, the 1 AM - 3 AM window is 'Liver Time.' Waking here often suggests the liver is struggling with toxic load or the adrenals are spiking cortisol to compensate for a blood sugar drop."

                "High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dark circles under the eyes, or infraorbital edema, are often caused by venous pooling due to chronic congestion in the sinus cavities, frequently linked to food sensitivities or environmental allergies."

            "id": "q1_8",

                "The most severe symptom the client mentions first",
                "The recurring theme or physiological commonality that links disparate symptoms across systems",
                "A specific type of rash that indicates a systemic emergency",
                "The client's family history of cardiovascular events"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Red Thread' is the underlying pattern (e.g., systemic inflammation, dryness, or stagnation) that connects seemingly unrelated symptoms like joint pain, dry eyes, and constipation."

            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old male with a 'Choleric' temperament presents with a red tip on the tongue, a loud voice, and a deep horizontal crease on the earlobe (Frank’s Sign). These indicators collectively suggest a need to support:",
            "options": [
                "The lymphatic system and thyroid function",
                "The cardiovascular system and stress management",
                "The musculoskeletal system and bone density",
                "The reproductive system and hormonal balance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Choleric temperament (fire), red tongue tip (heart heat), and Frank's Sign (earlobe crease) are all traditional and modern indicators associated with cardiovascular stress and high sympathetic tone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While often mistakenly attributed to calcium, white spots on the nails are a hallmark sign of zinc deficiency, which is essential for protein synthesis and nail matrix health."
