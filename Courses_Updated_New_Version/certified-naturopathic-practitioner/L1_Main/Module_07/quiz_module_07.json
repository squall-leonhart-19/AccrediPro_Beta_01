            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms, specifically experiencing a second wind of energy at 10:00 PM. Salivary testing reveals elevated night-time cortisol. Which stage of HPA axis dysfunction does this pattern most likely represent?",
            "options": [
                "Stage 1: The Alarm Phase (Acute Hypercortisolemia)",
                "Stage 2: The Resistance/Adaptation Phase",
                "Stage 3: The Exhaustion Phase (Hypocortisolemia)",
                "Acute Sympathetic Surge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Stage 2 (Resistance), the body attempts to adapt to chronic stress, often resulting in dysregulated circadian rhythms where cortisol is low in the morning but elevated at night, causing the 'tired but wired' sensation."

        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "The 5'-deiodinase enzyme is responsible for the peripheral conversion of T4 into the biologically active T3. Which mineral is the essential cofactor for this enzyme's function?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium",
                "Copper",
                "Selenium",
                "Manganese"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is the primary cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes. A deficiency in selenium can lead to impaired T4 to T3 conversion, even if the thyroid gland is producing sufficient T4."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In Naturopathic Endocrinology, the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (Cortisol Shunt) explains how chronic stress depletes sex hormones. Which precursor is diverted toward cortisol production at the expense of DHEA and Progesterone?",
            "options": [
                "Pregnenolone",
                "Cholesterol",
                "Androstenedione",
                "Aldosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pregnenolone is the 'mother hormone.' Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes survival (cortisol) over reproduction, 'stealing' the pregnenolone pool to synthesize cortisol instead of DHEA or Progesterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client's HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) calculation results in a score of 3.8. How should a practitioner interpret this finding?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal insulin sensitivity",
                "Early insulin resistance (mild)",
                "Significant insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility",
                "Likely Type 1 Diabetes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' ranges vary, naturopathic standards consider HOMA-IR optimal below 1.5. A score above 1.9 indicates early resistance, and scores above 3.0 typically signify significant insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which botanical is specifically indicated for hyperthyroid-like symptoms (palpitations, anxiety) because it inhibits the binding of TSH to its receptor and interferes with T4 to T3 conversion?",
            "options": [
                "Commiphora mukul (Guggul)",
                "Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha)",
                "Lycopus virginicus (Bugleweed)",
                "Fucus vesiculosus (Bladderwrack)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lycopus virginicus (Bugleweed) is a thyro-sedative herb used in cases of mild hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease to reduce thyroid hormone activity and manage autonomic symptoms."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "During the mid-luteal phase (Day 21 of a 28-day cycle), a deficiency in which hormone is the primary driver of PMS symptoms like irritability, breast tenderness, and spotting?",
            "options": [
                "Estradiol",
                "Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "Progesterone",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone should be at its peak during the mid-luteal phase. If it is low relative to estrogen (Estrogen Dominance), the client will typically experience PMS and luteal phase defect symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "In male hormonal health, what is the clinical significance of an elevated Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) level despite normal Total Testosterone?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates high levels of Free Testosterone",
                "It suggests the client has excessive Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)",
                "It reduces the amount of 'Free' or bioavailable testosterone, leading to symptoms of low T",
                "It confirms that the liver is detoxifying estrogen efficiently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone with high affinity. If SHBG is too high, it 'locks up' the testosterone, leaving very little 'Free Testosterone' available to bind to cellular receptors."

        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Xenoestrogens like Bisphenol A (BPA) and Phthalates disrupt the endocrine system primarily by which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "They destroy the adrenal cortex",
                "They bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERα/ERβ), mimicking natural 17β-estradiol",
                "They prevent the liver from producing bile",
                "They increase the half-life of insulin in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are endocrine disruptors that mimic the shape of natural estrogen, binding to receptors and sending inappropriate growth or signaling messages to tissues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which specific liver detoxification pathway is responsible for the 'Phase II' neutralization of estrogen metabolites via the addition of a methyl group, preventing the formation of DNA-damaging quinones?",
            "options": [
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Sulfation",
                "COMT-mediated Methylation",
                "Acetylation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase) enzyme methylates 2-OH and 4-OH estrogens. This is a critical step in safely excreting estrogens and preventing them from becoming carcinogenic."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client experiences a sharp rise in fasting blood glucose between 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM without eating. This is caused by the nocturnal surge of growth hormone and cortisol. What is this phenomenon called?",
            "options": [
                "The Somogyi Effect",
                "The Dawn Phenomenon",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dawn Phenomenon is a normal physiological surge in hormones (cortisol/GH) designed to wake the body up, which can cause elevated fasting glucose in those with insulin resistance."
