            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tolle Causam (Identify and Treat the Cause) focuses on looking beyond the symptoms to find the 'why' behind the 'what,' addressing the fundamental physiological or environmental drivers of dysfunction."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; high levels are associated with 'leaky gut' and the subsequent passage of endotoxins into the bloodstream."

            "id": "q2_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The exhaustion phase occurs after prolonged chronic stress when the adrenal glands can no longer maintain high output, resulting in a 'flat' curve and systemic fatigue."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Epigenetics teaches us that while DNA is the 'blueprint,' the actual 'architect' of gene expression is the environment. Which mechanism involves adding a methyl group to DNA to typically 'silence' a gene?",

                "Because glucose is the only fuel source the body can ever use.",
                "Because dysglycemia acts as a constant internal stressor that triggers the HPA axis and fuels inflammation.",
                "Because it is the easiest marker to change with supplements alone.",
                "Because insulin is responsible for the detoxification of heavy metals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Instability in blood sugar creates a 'vicious cycle' of cortisol spikes and inflammatory cytokine production, making it difficult to heal other systems until glucose is stabilized."

                "Joint pain caused the skin rashes, which then led to gut permeability.",
                "Intestinal dysbiosis triggered Zonulin release, causing 'leaky gut,' allowing endotoxins to enter circulation and trigger systemic inflammation.",
                "The brain fog caused a lack of movement, which resulted in low CRP levels.",
                "A lack of dietary protein caused the tight junctions to fail, leading to localized joint infection."
