            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Obesogens are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that interfere with hormonal signaling and activate PPAR-gamma, which can trigger the formation of new fat cells (adipogenesis)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR is calculated as (Glucose x Insulin) / 405. Here, (95 x 15) / 405 = 3.5. A score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while scores above 2.9 indicate significant resistance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that just one night of partial sleep deprivation can induce acute insulin resistance in healthy subjects, highlighting the role of circadian stewardship in metabolic health."
