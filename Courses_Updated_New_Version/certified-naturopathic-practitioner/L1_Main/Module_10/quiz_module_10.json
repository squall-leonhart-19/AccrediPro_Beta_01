            "question": "Which pro-inflammatory cytokine is primarily recognized in the Neuro-Endocrine-Immune (NEI) axis for inducing 'sickness behavior' by crossing the blood-brain barrier and signaling the hypothalamus?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-10 (IL-10)",
                "Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IL-1beta is a key mediator of the NEI axis; it is produced by immune cells and acts on the brain to induce lethargy, anorexia, and fever (sickness behavior) during infection or inflammation."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the Gut-Brain-Microbiome axis, which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is most critical for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and regulating microglia activation?",

                "Lactate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is highly significant in the gut-brain axis for its ability to upregulate tight junction proteins in the BBB and exert anti-inflammatory effects on microglia."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Mitochondrial 'Retrograde Signaling' is best defined as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Retrograde signaling is a homeostatic mechanism where mitochondria send signals (via ROS, calcium, or metabolites) to the nucleus to adjust gene expression based on the organelle's functional state."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Phase III detoxification is distinct from Phases I and II because it focuses on:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III involves 'antiporters' or efflux transporters (like MRP2 and P-gp) that pump conjugated toxins out of cells into the bile or urine for final excretion."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "How does chronic HPA axis activation (elevated cortisol) typically impact the HPT (Thyroid) axis at the peripheral level?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the conversion of T4 to T3.",
                "It increases the sensitivity of the TSH receptor.",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, decreasing the conversion of T4 to active T3 and increasing Reverse T3 (rT3).",
                "It has no measurable effect on thyroid hormone metabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels suppress the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into the active T3, leading to a functional hypothyroid state despite 'normal' TSH levels."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is up to 10 times more active during sleep, particularly deep NREM sleep, as the interstitial space expands to allow CSF to flush out metabolic debris."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The kidneys compensate for acidosis by excreting more H+ ions and generating/reabsorbing more bicarbonate to buffer the blood's pH."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Which percentage of the Vagus nerve (CN X) is comprised of afferent (sensory) fibers, emphasizing its role in sending signals from the viscera to the brain?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 80-90% of the Vagus nerve fibers are afferent, meaning the vast majority of gut-brain communication is sensory information traveling from the gut to the brain."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client with 'Estrogen Dominance' and poor Phase II conjugation is struggling with constipation. According to hepatobiliary physiology, why must the bowels be addressed before inducing Phase I/II detoxification?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the 're-absorption' of de-conjugated toxins and hormones via the enterohepatic circulation.",
                "Because Phase I enzymes require a high-fiber environment to function.",
                "Constipation inhibits the production of bile in the gallbladder.",
                "To ensure the client is in a sympathetic state for detox."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If Phase III (excretion/bowel movement) is sluggish, conjugated toxins and hormones (like estrogen) can be de-conjugated by gut bacteria (like beta-glucuronidase) and re-absorbed into the bloodstream, worsening the toxic load."
