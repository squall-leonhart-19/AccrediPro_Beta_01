            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radiotherapy works by creating reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy cancer cells; high-dose antioxidants during treatment may theoretically neutralize these ROS, reducing the efficacy of the therapy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The maturation of an oocyte takes approximately 90-100 days, and spermatogenesis takes about 74 days; thus, 3-4 months of intervention is required to influence the health of the gametes."
