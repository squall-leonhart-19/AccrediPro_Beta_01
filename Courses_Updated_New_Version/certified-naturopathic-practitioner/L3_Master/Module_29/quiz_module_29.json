            "question": "In the N.A.T.U.R.E. Framework™ for advanced clinical reasoning, what is the primary focus of the 'U' (Uncover Underlying Drivers) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Identifying the primary symptom for immediate suppression",
                "Distinguishing between physiological compensations and true root causes",
                "Selecting the appropriate botanical formula for the patient",
                "Updating the patient's electronic health record"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'U' phase focuses on deep synthesis to differentiate between what the body is doing to compensate (symptoms) and the actual upstream drivers (root causes) like latent infections or nutrient deficiencies."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "When managing complex multimorbidity, which 'Triage Principle' should a Master Practitioner apply first?",
            "options": [
                "Treating all diagnosed conditions simultaneously with high-dose supplements",
                "Prioritizing the condition with the most expensive medication",
                "Removing 'Barriers to Healing' (e.g., sleep deprivation or gut dysbiosis) before specific pathology targeting",
                "Focusing exclusively on the most recent diagnosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, addressing foundational barriers like sleep, hydration, and GI function (triage) is necessary to ensure the body has the capacity to respond to more specific interventions."

            "question": "Which nutrient synergy is most effective for supporting mitochondrial biogenesis and protecting against oxidative sarcopenia?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C and Vitamin E",
                "PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone) and CoQ10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PQQ and CoQ10 work synergistically; PQQ stimulates the spontaneous generation of new mitochondria (biogenesis), while CoQ10 optimizes the electron transport chain within them."

            "options": [
                "To serve as the primary active ingredient for the main pathology",
                "To improve the flavor of the tincture for better compliance",
                "To mitigate potential side effects or harshness of the 'King' or 'Minister' herbs",
                "To increase the shelf life of the botanical extract"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Corrigent (or corrective) herb is used to balance the formula, reducing unwanted effects like the GI irritation sometimes caused by potent 'King' herbs."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "According to Environmental Medicine principles, why is a 'Normal' GGT (40-50 U/L) on a lab report often flagged by functional practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates the patient is drinking too much water",
                "It may signal the early depletion of intracellular glutathione reserves",
                "It is a definitive marker for acute viral hepatitis",
                "It suggests the patient has a high intake of dietary protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 40-50 U/L is often 'normal' in conventional ranges, functional medicine views levels above 20-25 U/L as a potential sign of increased demand for glutathione due to toxic burden."

            "question": "In Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), the term 'Sickness Behavior' is primarily mediated by which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of willpower and psychological resilience",
                "Overstimulation of the prefrontal cortex",

                "Excessive consumption of simple carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sickness behavior (lethargy, social withdrawal, anhedonia) is a coordinated biological response driven by peripheral cytokines communicating with the CNS via the vagus nerve and BBB."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "A patient presents with a TSH of 2.4 mIU/L (normal), but a Free T3 at the bottom of the range and a high Reverse T3 (rT3). This pattern most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism requiring T4 medication",
                "Grave's Disease (Hyperthyroidism)",

                "A perfectly healthy thyroid profile"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High rT3 alongside low-normal Free T3 suggests the body is 'braking' metabolic activity, often due to high cortisol, systemic inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies (Selenium/Zinc) rather than a thyroid gland failure."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical responsibility of 'Master Stewardship' in long-term case management?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the patient remains on a minimum of 15 supplements indefinitely",
                "Transitioning the patient from 'Crisis Management' to 'Self-Directed Wellness' to prevent dependency",
                "Always deferring to conventional guidelines even when they contradict naturopathic philosophy",
                "Focusing exclusively on the patient's physical symptoms while ignoring mental health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical stewardship involves 'deprescribing' unnecessary supplements and empowering the patient with lifestyle mastery so they eventually require less clinical intervention."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old patient has high 'Total Toxic Burden' (TTB) and severe HPA axis dysregulation (exhaustion). What is the safest clinical sequence?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate 10-day water fast to clear toxins",
                "High-dose chelation therapy followed by adrenal support",
                "Stabilize the HPA axis and support cellular energy (ATP) before initiating aggressive detoxification",
                "Focus only on exercise to 'sweat out' the toxins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Detoxification is an energy-dependent process. If a patient is in adrenal exhaustion, aggressive detox can lead to a 'healing crisis' or systemic collapse; stabilization must come first."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "Which 'Precision Lab' marker is the most sensitive indicator of systemic, low-grade chronic inflammation when interpreted alongside Ferritin?",
            "options": [
                "High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)",
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)",
                "Hemoglobin A1c"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is the gold standard for detecting low-grade systemic inflammation. When Ferritin is also high, it confirms that the Ferritin elevation is likely an 'acute phase reactant' response rather than just iron storage."
