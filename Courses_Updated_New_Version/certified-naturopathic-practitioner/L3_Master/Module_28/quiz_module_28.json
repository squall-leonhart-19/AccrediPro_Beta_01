            "question": "A client presents with a sudden 'thunderclap' headache, described as the worst pain of their life, accompanied by neck stiffness. What is the correct clinical triage protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Administer high-dose magnesium and riboflavin for migraine relief.",
                "Perform a Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS) test to check for mold exposure.",
                "Immediate referral to the Emergency Room for suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage.",
                "Recommend a 24-hour dark room protocol and follow up the next morning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'thunderclap' headache combined with nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness) is a classic 'Red Flag' for subarachnoid hemorrhage and requires immediate emergency medical intervention."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the context of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which cytokine is often referred to as the 'master switch' and primary target for natural immunomodulation during a cytokine storm?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)",
                "Interleukin-10 (IL-10)",
                "TGF-Beta 1",
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "IL-6 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives the systemic response in SIRS. While IL-10 is anti-inflammatory and CRP is a marker, IL-6 is the primary driver of the 'storm' pathology."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "During an acute autoimmune flare, which natural intervention strategy is most appropriate for rapid immunomodulation according to the module's 'Calm' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive gut lining repair with high-dose L-Glutamine and Collagen.",
                "High-dose liposomal Glutathione and Vitamin D3 (up to 50,000 IU daily for 3 days).",

                "Intense aerobic exercise to stimulate lymphatic drainage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Calm' phase focuses on rapid suppression of inflammation. High-dose Vitamin D3 and liposomal Glutathione act as potent immunomodulators to dampen the overactive immune response during a flare."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) from mold exposure fails the Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS) test. What does this specifically indicate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The VCS test measures the ability to see details at low contrast levels. Failure is a hallmark of biotoxin illness, indicating that neurotoxins are affecting the neurological processing of visual information."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "Which clinical sign is the most critical differentiator between standard HPA-Axis Dysfunction (Adrenal Fatigue) and a life-threatening Adrenal Crisis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While salt cravings and fatigue are common in HPA-D, an Adrenal Crisis involves severe hypotension and potential vascular collapse that does not respond to simple hydration, requiring IV corticosteroids."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "The 'Cunningham Panel' is a specialized diagnostic tool used in complex neuro-psychiatric cases (PANS/PANDAS) to measure:",

                "The presence of Streptococcal DNA in the blood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cunningham Panel measures five specific antibodies (including Anti-Tubulin and Anti-Dopamine Receptors) that cross the blood-brain barrier and trigger neuro-inflammation in PANS/PANDAS."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort induces the CYP3A4 enzyme, which accelerates the metabolism of many drugs (like cyclosporine, warfarin, and oral contraceptives), rendering them less effective or sub-therapeutic."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "When managing a 'Herxheimer Reaction' during Lyme disease treatment, which 'drainage' support is most essential to mitigate the cytokine release?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Herxheimer reactions occur when endotoxins are released faster than the body can clear them. Binders and alkalinization help neutralize and remove these toxins, reducing the systemic inflammatory burden."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "In the 'Bucket Theory' of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), symptoms typically occur when:",
            "options": [
                "The client consumes any amount of high-histamine food.",
                "The cumulative load of triggers (stress, toxins, food, infections) exceeds the individual's threshold.",
                "The liver's Phase 1 detoxification is faster than Phase 2.",
                "The client has a genetic SNP in the MTHFR gene."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MCAS is often about 'total load.' A client might tolerate one trigger, but when multiple triggers (the 'bucket' filling up) occur simultaneously, the mast cells degranulate systemically."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In the N.A.T.U.R.E. Exit Strategy framework, what is the primary goal of the 'Restore' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the underlying infection using PCR testing.",
                "To transition from acute symptom management to rebuilding physiological resilience and organ reserve.",
                "To refer the client back to their primary care physician for long-term medication.",
                "To eliminate all supplements and return to a standard diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Restore' phase occurs after the crisis is stabilized. It focuses on rebuilding the 'vital reserve' and repairing the damage caused by the inflammatory event to prevent future relapses."
