            "question": "In 'The Architecture of Group Resonance,' what is the primary purpose of the 'Liminal Bridge' phase at the start of a session?",
            "options": [
                "To collect payment and handle administrative tasks",
                "To facilitate the transition from individual chaotic energy to a unified group field",
                "To perform a deep Root Chakra clearing for every individual",
                "To establish a hierarchy between the practitioner and the participants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Liminal Bridge is a critical phase designed to help participants shed their external stressors and entrain their energy to the collective group field, creating coherence."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When designing a Signature 7-Week Chakra Series, why is it recommended to dedicate the entire first week to the Root Chakra (Muladhara)?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is the most complex chakra to understand intellectually",
                "To ensure the group has a stable energetic container to hold the higher-frequency work in later weeks",
                "To allow participants time to pay their remaining tuition balances",
                "Because most group participants have a hyperactive Root Chakra by default"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Building from the ground up ensures that participants are sufficiently grounded. Without a stable Root foundation, the 'ascension' through higher chakras can lead to ungroundedness or emotional volatility in a group setting."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In group work, the 'Magnified Mirror' effect occurs when the collective energy amplifies individual experiences, often leading to resonant emotional breakthroughs across the group."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital resonance requires managing screen fatigue. The 20-20-20 rule helps maintain the practitioner's and participants' Third Eye and Eye Chakra health during long virtual sessions."

            "question": "A participant in your 7-week series is consistently 'leaking' energy, becoming the center of attention and disrupting the group flow. What is the recommended 'Solar Plexus' intervention?",
