            "options": [
                "The practitioner is personally delivering 40+ hours of sessions per week",
                "Revenue is tied directly to the practitioner's active labor hours",
                "The implementation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) allows the business to function without the practitioner's constant presence",
                "The practitioner handles all administrative, marketing, and healing tasks personally to ensure quality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CEO transition is marked by moving from 'working in the business' to 'working on the business.' SOPs are the foundational tools that allow systems to replace individual labor, enabling true scalability."
