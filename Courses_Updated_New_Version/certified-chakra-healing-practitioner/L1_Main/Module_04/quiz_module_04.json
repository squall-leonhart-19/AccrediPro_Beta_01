            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypo-activity is characterized by a lack of vitality, physical coolness, and 'sunken' energy, requiring a targeted infusion of Prana."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must act as a 'hollow reed' or conduit; using personal vital reserves leads to rapid burnout and depletion for the practitioner."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
