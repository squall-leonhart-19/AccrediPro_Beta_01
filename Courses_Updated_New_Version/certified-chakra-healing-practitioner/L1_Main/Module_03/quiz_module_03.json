            "question": "In the context of the pathophysiology of energetic stagnation, which physiological structure is primarily responsible for the 'memory' of physical and emotional trauma through piezo-electric signaling?",
            "options": [
                "The Myofascial System",
                "The Lymphatic System",
                "The Endocrine Glands",
                "The Peripheral Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 explains that fascia acts as a semiconductor of bio-electric information; when trauma occurs, the collagen fibers can become dense and dehydrated, 'locking' the energetic charge in place."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "During a Somatic Release session (Lesson 2), a practitioner observes a client experiencing involuntary tremors in the legs. According to TRE (Tension Releasing Exercises) principles, what does this indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A dangerous drop in blood sugar levels",
                "Muscle fatigue from over-exertion",
                "The discharge of the sympathetic nervous system's 'freeze' response",
                "An allergic reaction to the energetic environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Involuntary tremors (neurogenic tremors) are the body's natural mechanism for discharging high-arousal states stored in the Psoas and surrounding tissues, as discussed in the Somatic Release lesson."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Breathwork for energetic purging (Lesson 3) often utilizes conscious connected breathing to induce a state of 'Respiratory Alkalosis.' What is the primary biochemical shift occurring here?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) levels",
                "A decrease in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and an increase in blood pH",
                "A decrease in Oxygen (O2) and a decrease in blood pH",
                "A massive spike in Cortisol production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid, circular breathing 'blows off' CO2, raising the pH of the blood (alkalosis), which temporarily reduces the activity of the 'egoic' prefrontal cortex, allowing suppressed energetic debris to surface."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Which specific Solfeggio frequency is traditionally utilized in 'Vibrational Dissolution' for facilitating change and 'undoing' situations of stagnation?",
            "options": [
                "396 Hz",
                "417 Hz",
                "528 Hz",
                "639 Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As detailed in Lesson 4, 417 Hz is the frequency associated with clearing traumatic experiences and facilitating change within the energetic body."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the concept of 'Secondary Gain' is discussed. What does this term refer to in the context of psychological debris?",
            "options": [
                "The financial benefit a practitioner receives from a session",
                "The subconscious benefit or 'protection' a client receives from maintaining a blockage",
                "The second chakra's influence on the third chakra",
                "The improvement of physical symptoms after one session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain explains why some blockages persist; the subconscious mind may believe the blockage provides safety, attention, or an excuse to avoid a perceived greater fear."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "When performing an Elemental Clearing (Lesson 6) for a client who feels 'stuck' in heavy, grief-filled emotions that they cannot express, which elemental protocol is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Earth (Prithvi) - for grounding and stability",
                "Water (Jala) - for fluidity and emotional movement",
                "Fire (Tejas) - for rapid incineration of trauma",
                "Air (Vayu) - for mental clarity and detachment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Water element governs the flow of emotions; its clearing protocol is specifically designed to dissolve 'frozen' or stagnant emotional states like grief."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is the 'Reciprocity Principle' in Cord Cutting?",
            "options": [
                "You must cut the cord from both ends simultaneously",
                "The cord only exists if both parties have an active emotional charge",
                "The practitioner must pay the client for the energy exchanged",
                "Energy always flows from the younger person to the older person"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cord cutting is most effective when the practitioner addresses the 'hook' or 'anchor' within the client that allows the attachment to persist, acknowledging that cords are often maintained by mutual (though often subconscious) resonance."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the 'D' Protocol (Lesson 8), what is the first step a practitioner should take before applying any dissolution techniques?",
            "options": [
                "Incineration of the blockage using Fire visualization",
                "Identification and Localization (Mapping the Stasis)",
                "Forced breathing to induce purging",
                "Cutting all cords with the client's family"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'D' Protocol requires precise 'Identification and Localization' first; you cannot effectively dissolve what you have not accurately mapped and understood."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a chronic 'lump in the throat' and an inability to set boundaries at work. Which chakra is the primary site of stagnation, and which 'D' Protocol technique is most indicated?",
            "options": [
                "Root Chakra; Grounding with Earth element",
                "Solar Plexus; Fire breath for power",
                "Throat Chakra; Vibrational sound clearing (Vissudha resonance)",
                "Heart Chakra; Cord cutting with the spouse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'lump in the throat' is a classic somatic sign of Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) blockage, often cleared effectively using vibrational sound and frequency as taught in Lessons 4 and 8."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Bohr Effect' and why is it relevant to the Breathwork for Energetic Purging (Lesson 3)?",
            "options": [
                "The effect of sound on water molecules",
                "The principle that lower CO2 levels in the blood actually make it harder for oxygen to be released into the tissues",
                "The law of gravity applied to energetic cords",
                "The psychological phenomenon of 'mirroring' a practitioner's breath"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Bohr Effect explains why intense breathwork (which lowers CO2) causes a paradoxical lack of oxygen delivery to certain brain tissues, facilitating the 'altered state' necessary for deep energetic purging."
