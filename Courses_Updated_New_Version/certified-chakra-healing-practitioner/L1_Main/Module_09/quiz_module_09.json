                "It utilizes a non-linear, symptoms-only approach to energetic healing.",
                "It moves from symptom management to a structured, 7-step root-cause resolution process.",
                "It replaces the need for somatic integration with purely mental visualization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The RADIANT framework is a structured, 7-step architectural approach designed to move beyond temporary 'balancing' and achieve permanent root-cause resolution."
