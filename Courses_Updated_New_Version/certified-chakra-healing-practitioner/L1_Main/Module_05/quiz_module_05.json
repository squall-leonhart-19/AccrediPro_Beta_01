            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase-locking occurs when two separate oscillating systems (like practitioner and client) synchronize their frequencies, creating a stable, unified energetic state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic integration ensures that high-frequency energetic changes are anchored into the physical body and fascia, preventing the 'un-grounded' feeling often associated with energetic bypass."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cord-cutting is a hygiene protocol that prevents the practitioner from remaining 'entrained' to the client's trauma or imbalanced frequencies after the session ends."
