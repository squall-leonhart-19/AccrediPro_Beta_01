            "question": "According to the 'Biofield Blueprint' (L1), what is the primary function of the toroidal flow within the human energetic field?",
            "options": [
                "To create a static barrier against external pathogens",
                "To facilitate the continuous recycling and filtration of prana through the central channel",
                "To prevent the chakras from spinning too rapidly during emotional distress",
                "To store ancestral memories in the outer layers of the aura"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The toroidal flow is a dynamic, self-recycling energy pattern that moves prana through the heart and central channel, acting as a metabolic system for the biofield."

            "question": "During a 'Resonant Assessment' (L2), a practitioner feels a 'dense, magnetic resistance' about 4 inches above the Solar Plexus. This finding most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "An energetic void requiring immediate infusion",
                "A healthy, high-vibrational frequency",
                "Stagnant emotional 'sludge' or a blockage in the processing of personal power",
                "The presence of a parasitic attachment from a third party"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dense, magnetic resistance during scanning typically signifies stagnation or 'heavy' energy that has not yet been processed or released."

            "question": "In the 'Mapping the Psyche' (L3) framework, which chakra alignment strategy is specifically used to address 'The Martyr Complex'?",

            "options": [
                "Never dissolve energy while the client is crying",
                "Always fill the space immediately after clearing to prevent a 'vacuum' effect",

                "Dissolve from the Crown down to the Root only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clearing creates an energetic 'void.' If not immediately filled with high-vibrational prana (Infusion), the void may naturally pull back in surrounding low-vibrational debris."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchoring uses physical pressure (heels to floor) and specific vocal tonics to bridge the energetic shift into the physical nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 15-20 minute refractory period allows the practitioner's biofield to reset and prevents 'empathic bleeding' or residue carryover between clients."

            "question": "In the Module 14.8 Case Study regarding 'The Transformation Cycle,' why was the 'Integration' phase considered the most critical for the client 'David'?",
            "options": [
                "Because he had a physical reaction to the crystals used",
                "Because his sudden energetic opening required a 48-hour 'low-stimulus' protocol to prevent burnout",
                "Because he refused to pay for the session until he saw results",
                "Because he needed to learn how to perform Reiki on himself"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "David experienced a significant shift; without the 'low-stimulus' integration protocol, the rapid expansion could lead to an 'energetic crash' or nervous system overwhelm."
