            "options": [
                "It focuses purely on the temporary relief of physical symptoms.",
                "It involves the permanent synthesis of energetic shifts into the client’s identity and baseline reality.",
                "It requires the practitioner to take over the client's energetic maintenance indefinitely.",
                "It is a process that occurs only during the actual healing session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is the process of moving from 'temporary relief' to a 'permanent baseline shift' where the healing becomes a part of the client's identity."

            "options": [
                "Because the body is the 'hardware' that must be updated to support the new energetic 'software'.",

                "To ensure the client remains dependent on physical touch.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic embodiment ensures that the nervous system (the hardware) is regulated and rewired to sustain the higher-vibrational energetic shifts (the software)."
