            "question": "According to the Physics of Energetic Frequency (Lesson 2), what occurs during the process of 'Entrainment'?",
            "options": [
                "Two oscillating systems with different periods fall into synchrony with a more powerful oscillator",
                "The biofield completely collapses to protect the physical body from external frequencies",
                "The practitioner's frequency is lowered to match the client's lower vibrational state permanently",
                "Energy is converted into heat through the friction of two opposing electromagnetic fields"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is a principle of physics where two rhythmic systems interact and align their pulses to the more dominant frequency, which is a foundational concept for resonant healing."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Somatic Resonance), a practitioner feels a 'cold, breezy' sensation while hand-scanning the Heart Chakra. This most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "An inflammatory response or overactive energy flow",
                "A state of congestion where energy is stuck and stagnant",
                "A deficiency or 'void' in the energy field where the chakra is underactive",
                "A perfectly balanced and neutral energetic state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In bio-energetic scanning, heat typically indicates overactivity or inflammation, while cold or 'empty' sensations indicate deficiency or underactivity."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When using a pendulum for assessment (Lesson 5), a 'neutral' or 'stationary' response over a specific chakra typically suggests:",
            "options": [
                "The chakra is rotating too fast for the pendulum to track",
                "A 'blocked' state or a significant lack of energy movement in that center",
                "The practitioner is not properly grounded and should stop the session",
                "The client has achieved a state of 'Nirvana' or total energetic stillness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A pendulum that refuses to move or stays stationary over a chakra usually signals a 'closed' or blocked state where there is insufficient energy flow to produce a swing."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "During the Resonant Intake Interview (Lesson 7), why is it critical to ask 'Where do you feel that in your body right now?'",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from their emotional pain",
                "To diagnose specific medical conditions that require a prescription",
                "To bridge the gap between the client's narrative and their somatic reality",
                "To prove to the client that their symptoms are entirely imaginary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonant intake focuses on somatic markers; asking where a feeling resides helps the practitioner identify which chakra centers are actively responding to the client's current stressors."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Visual Assessment (Lesson 3) identifies 'armoring' as a key cue. If a client consistently sits with their arms tightly crossed over their chest and shoulders hunched forward, which chakra is likely being 'guarded'?",
            "options": [
                "Root Chakra (Muladhara)",
                "Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura)",
                "Heart Chakra (Anahata)",
                "Crown Chakra (Sahasrara)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Physical 'armoring' over the chest area, such as hunched shoulders and crossed arms, is a classic visual cue for a protective or wounded Heart Chakra."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Clairsentient Detection.' What is the primary risk for a practitioner who has not mastered 'energetic hygiene' during an intuitive scan?",
            "options": [
                "They might lose their ability to see colors in the aura",
                "They may experience 'emotional mirroring' and take on the client's symptoms as their own",
                "The client's chakras will automatically close to protect themselves",
                "The pendulum will provide inaccurate readings for the next 24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without proper boundaries and hygiene, clairsentient practitioners risk 'absorbing' the client's energetic density, leading to fatigue or symptomatic mirroring."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "In the 'Synthesis' phase (Lesson 8), what is a 'Primary Driver'?",
            "options": [
                "The first chakra the practitioner ever learned about",
                "The client's strongest chakra that compensates for all others",
                "The core imbalance that is causing secondary symptoms in other chakras",
                "The musical frequency used to begin the healing session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis involves finding the 'Primary Driver'—the root imbalance that, if corrected, will naturally resolve or improve the secondary imbalances in the rest of the system."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "According to bio-energetic foundations (Lesson 1), the 'Human Biofield' was officially recognized as a 'subtle energy field' by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) in what year?",
            "options": [
                "1974",
                "1992",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NIH established the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992, which officially recognized the term 'Biofield' to describe the field of energy and information that surrounds the human body."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah presents with chronic throat clearing, a 'lump' in her throat when she tries to speak up at work, and a pendulum reading that shows a small, counter-clockwise circle at the throat. What is the most likely assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Overactive Vishuddha (Throat) chakra causing excess speech",
                "Balanced Vishuddha (Throat) chakra with temporary physical irritation",
                "Underactive/Blocked Vishuddha (Throat) chakra related to self-expression",
                "Excessive Root Chakra energy rising too quickly to the head"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The physical 'lump' sensation combined with a counter-clockwise pendulum swing (indicating restricted flow) points to an underactive or blocked Throat Chakra."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "When performing a hand scan (Lesson 4), the 'rebound' or 'push-back' sensation against the practitioner's palm is typically a sign of:",
            "options": [
                "A hole or leak in the client's aura",
                "A healthy, vibrant, and resilient energetic boundary",
                "The client rejecting the practitioner's presence",
                "A total lack of energy in that specific area"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'rebound' or 'elastic' feeling during a scan is generally a positive indicator of a healthy, vibrant biofield with good energetic 'tonicity'."
