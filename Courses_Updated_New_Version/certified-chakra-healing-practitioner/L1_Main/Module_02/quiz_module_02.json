            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Alignment' framework, what is the primary reason for addressing 'Energetic Leaks' before attempting to 'Charge' a deficient chakra?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner does not become exhausted during the session",
                "Because adding energy to a leaking system is inefficient and prevents sustainable results",
                "Because leaks only occur in the Root chakra and must be grounded first",
                "To allow the client to feel the depletion more acutely before healing begins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 and 3 emphasize that 'plugging the leaks' (addressing trauma or energy drains) is essential because attempting to fill or charge a chakra that cannot hold energy leads to temporary results and practitioner frustration."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to Psychological Symptom Mapping, a client presenting with chronic 'imposter syndrome' and a lack of personal boundaries is most likely experiencing a primary imbalance in which chakra?",
            "options": [
                "The Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana)",
                "The Heart Chakra (Anahata)",
                "The Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura)",
                "The Crown Chakra (Sahasrara)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Solar Plexus is the center of self-worth, personal power, and boundaries. Imposter syndrome is a classic psychological marker of a deficient Solar Plexus energy center."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When determining Intervention Hierarchy, why is the 'Bottom-Up' approach (starting with the Root) generally preferred for clients with high anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "Anxiety is always caused by a physical deficiency in the legs",
                "The Root chakra regulates the parasympathetic nervous system and provides the safety needed for higher work",
                "Higher chakras cannot be opened until the client has achieved spiritual enlightenment",
                "It is the only way to ensure the client pays for the full 7-session package"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 explains that the Root chakra provides the foundation of safety. Without stabilizing the 'container' and the nervous system, higher-level energetic work can actually increase anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4's Multi-Dimensional Roadmap, what are the three specific 'layers' that must be addressed for a comprehensive healing strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual/Energetic",
                "Past, Present, and Future",
                "Dietary, Financial, and Relationship",
                "Crystals, Sound, and Aromatherapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A professional roadmap must address the Physical (somatic), Emotional (psychological), and Spiritual/Energetic layers to ensure the alignment is integrated across the client's entire life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A practitioner is matching modalities for a client with an 'Excessive' Heart Chakra (over-extending to others, lack of self-care). Which tool selection is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Bright Red Jasper and high-intensity breathwork",
                "Rose Quartz and 528Hz Solfeggio frequencies",
                "Green Fluorite for discernment and 'cooling' meditative practices",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to stimulate movement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For an excessive chakra, we use 'sedating' or 'balancing' tools. Green Fluorite helps with mental clarity and boundaries (discernment), while cooling meditations help reduce the 'heat' of an overactive center."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'Behavioral KPI' (Key Performance Indicator) for a Throat Chakra intervention?",
            "options": [
                "The client reports feeling a 'tingling' sensation in their neck",
                "A pendulum swings in a clockwise circle over the throat area",
                "The client successfully initiates one difficult conversation at work without retracting their opinion",
                "The client wears blue clothing three days in a row"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Behavioral KPIs (Lesson 6) must be observable, real-world actions. Initiating a difficult conversation is a direct measurement of the Throat chakra's function of 'speaking one's truth.'"

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "When adapting a strategy for 'Complex Imbalances' (Lesson 7), what is the 'Dominant Chakra' theory?",
            "options": [
                "The idea that one chakra is always stronger than the others in every person",
                "The observation that one primary imbalance often causes 'secondary' symptoms in adjacent chakras",
                "The belief that the Crown chakra should dominate all healing sessions",
                "A method of using muscle testing to find which chakra is physically largest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dominant Chakra theory suggests that a primary 'root' imbalance (e.g., a blocked Solar Plexus) can create ripple effects or 'compensatory' imbalances in the Sacral or Heart centers."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "During the 'Presentation for Buy-In' (Lesson 8), why is it critical to use the client's own language when describing the strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To trick the client into thinking you have the same personality",
                "To build 'Cognitive Resonance' and ensure the client feels seen and understood",
                "Because practitioners are not allowed to use Sanskrit terms in professional settings",
                "To avoid having to explain the complex science of energy healing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using the client's own words to describe their pain and goals builds trust and 'Cognitive Resonance,' which significantly increases their commitment to the healing roadmap."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that multi-modal interventions (combining energy work with behavioral changes) increase long-term efficacy by what percentage compared to energy work alone?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Approximately 30%",
                "Over 60%",
                "It actually decreases efficacy due to 'modality overwhelm'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that integrating behavioral 'homework' with energetic sessions leads to significantly higher (60%+) retention of energetic alignment and long-term symptom relief."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended protocol for 'Strategy Adaptation' if a client shows no improvement after three sessions?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the same strategy for three more sessions to ensure it 'takes'",
                "Perform a 'Cross-Axis Assessment' to see if an imbalance in an opposing chakra is blocking progress",
                "Refer the client immediately to a different practitioner",
                "Tell the client they are not 'ready' for healing and pause all work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If progress stalls, Lesson 7 recommends looking at the 'Cross-Axis' (e.g., looking at the Third Eye if the Sacral is stuck) to identify hidden energetic blocks that prevent the primary chakra from aligning."
