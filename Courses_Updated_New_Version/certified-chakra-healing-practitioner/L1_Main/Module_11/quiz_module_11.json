            "question": "In Advanced Resonant Assessment (L1), what does a 'static crackle' sensation during biofield mapping typically indicate regarding the client's energetic state?",
            "options": [
                "A complete absence of energy in that specific chakra",
                "Acute emotional discharge or recent trauma localized in the subtle body",
                "The natural frequency of the Crown Chakra during meditation",
                "A sign of healthy, high-vibrational integration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In biofield mapping, 'static crackle' or jagged tactile feedback is a clinical indicator of acute emotional discharge or unresolved recent trauma that hasn't yet settled into a chronic pattern."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to the Multi-Chakra Psychological Mapping (L2), a 'constricted loop' between the Solar Plexus and the Third Eye often manifests clinically as which symptom?",

                "Hyper-sexuality coupled with a lack of creative drive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Solar Plexus (will/action) and Third Eye (vision/intellect) loop, when constricted, results in 'analysis paralysis' where the client uses logic to bypass the discomfort of taking action."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "When dissolving deep-seated blockages (L3), what is the primary purpose of using 'low-frequency entrainment' (30Hz - 60Hz) before high-frequency infusion?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the client's heart rate for better circulation",
                "To create a 'shattering' effect on calcified energetic structures",
                "To induce a state of deep sleep (Delta) immediately",
                "To bypass the ego and access the subconscious through the Root Chakra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lower frequencies are used in clinical somatic work to vibrate and 'loosen' or shatter dense, calcified blockages before higher frequencies are used to flush the system."

            "id": "q11_4",

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "What is the 'Anchoring Frequency' (L5) and why is it critical post-alignment?",
            "options": [
                "It is a specific 528Hz tone used to open the Heart",
                "It is the process of tethering the expanded biofield to the physical body to prevent 'floatiness'",
                "It is a dietary protocol involving heavy proteins",
                "It is the final prayer spoken by the practitioner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Anchoring Frequency is the somatic integration step that ensures the client's expanded energetic state is 'locked' into their physical nervous system, preventing post-session disorientation."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Clinical Energetic Hygiene (L6) suggests that practitioners should perform 'Depolarization' after sessions. What is the recommended duration for a therapeutic salt soak to achieve field reset?",
            "options": [
                "5 minutes",
                "At least 20 minutes in a 2% saline solution",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 cites that a 20-minute soak in a 2% saline solution (sea salt or Himalayan salt) is the clinical standard for osmotic and energetic depolarization of the practitioner's field."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, which qualitative shift is considered the 'Gold Standard' for successful multi-chakra alignment?",

                "The client seeing bright purple lights during the session",
                "A self-reported reduction in physical pain by 10%",
                "Consistent Heart Rate Variability (HRV) coherence during the integration phase",
                "The practitioner feeling a sense of personal accomplishment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While subjective reports matter, HRV coherence is the primary physiological marker used in clinical energetic medicine to measure the qualitative shift into a balanced, 'aligned' state."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "According to Professional Ethics (L8), what is the appropriate action if a client experiences a 'Somatic Abreaction' (intense emotional/physical release) that lasts longer than 15 minutes?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the session and ask the client to leave",
                "Ground the client, end energetic work, and use the 'Containment Protocol' before referring to a therapist",
                "Increase the frequency of the infusion to 'push through' the trauma",
                "Tell the client they are being dramatic and to breathe through it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethics and Case Management dictate that if a release becomes an abreaction (uncontrolled trauma response), the practitioner must use containment protocols and refer to mental health professionals."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 2 describes a 'Power Struggle' client with an overactive Solar Plexus and a collapsed Heart. What is the first step in the 'Complex Alignment Strategy'?",

                "Perform a Crown Chakra opening to bring in divine wisdom"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In multi-chakra mapping, an overactive center must be sedated (calmed) while the deficient/collapsed center is primed to receive energy, restoring the balance between power and compassion."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "What does the 'Rule of Three' in Case Management (L8) refer to?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of Three' is a clinical case management standard where the practitioner observes the client's response over three sessions to establish a baseline of energetic 'plasticity' before making major protocol shifts."
