            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The RADIANT Method™ begins with Resonant Assessment, the process of scanning and identifying the current energetic state of the client's chakra system."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "During a Resonant Assessment scan, a practitioner detects a 'dense, heavy, and static' sensation over the Root Chakra. This tactile feedback typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "An overactive or 'blown open' center",
                "A significant energetic blockage or stagnant 'tamasic' energy",

                "A perfectly balanced and grounded state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dense and static sensations are hallmark indicators of stagnant energy or blockages that require clearing before infusion can occur."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "When performing an 'Infusion of Prana,' why is the direction of rotational flow critical for the practitioner to visualize?",
            "options": [
                "It determines the color of the chakra",
                "Clockwise rotation is generally used to vitalize and 'feed' a deficient center",
                "Counter-clockwise rotation is the only way to ground energy",
                "The direction does not actually impact the bio-energetic field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the RADIANT Method™, clockwise rotation (from the practitioner's perspective facing the client) is used to infuse and vitalize the center with fresh prana."

            "options": [
                "To increase the client's psychic sensitivity",
                "To ensure the energetic shift is integrated into the somatic (physical) body",
                "To end the session as quickly as possible",
                "To clear the practitioner's own energy field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchoring ensures that the high-frequency changes made during the session are 'locked in' to the physical nervous system to prevent energetic whiplash."

            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Nourishing Rituals' suggests that practitioners use a salt bath after sessions. What is the scientific basis for this energetic hygiene practice?",
            "options": [
                "Salt increases the skin's absorption of vitamin D",
                "The ionic properties of salt help neutralize and draw out 'static' from the electromagnetic field",
                "Salt water changes the DNA structure of the practitioner",
                "It is purely a psychological placebo with no energetic benefit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Salt (sodium chloride) has natural ionic properties that help ground the practitioner and clear residual 'energetic debris' picked up during a session."

            "id": "q13_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The study emphasized that daily energetic hygiene is the single greatest predictor of long-term stability in bio-energetic healing, showing a 65% increase in alignment retention."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "During 'Total Transformation' integration, a client experiences a 'healing crisis' (temporary worsening of symptoms). This is most likely due to:",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner performing the technique incorrectly",
                "The body processing and purging stored emotional toxins (Somatic Echo)",
                "The client being allergic to prana",
                "A permanent blockage that cannot be cleared"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'healing crisis' or Somatic Echo occurs as the physical and emotional bodies catch up to the energetic shifts, often involving a brief period of detoxification."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "In the RADIANT Method™, why must 'Dissolving Blockages' (D) always precede 'Infusion of Prana' (I)?",
            "options": [
                "Because you cannot effectively fill a vessel that is already full of stagnant 'waste'",
                "Because infusion is too painful for most clients",
                "It is simply an alphabetical requirement of the acronym",
                "Infusion actually creates more blockages if done first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Attempting to infuse prana into a blocked chakra is ineffective; the stagnant energy must be cleared (dissolved) to make room for fresh, vitalizing energy."
