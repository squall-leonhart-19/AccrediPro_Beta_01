            "question": "In the 'Anatomy of Total Transformation,' what is the primary distinction between symptom relief and true energetic evolution?",
            "options": [
                "Symptom relief focuses on physical comfort, while evolution requires addressing the 'Causal Body' and root energetic imprints.",
                "Symptom relief uses crystals, while total transformation only uses sound therapy.",
                "Total transformation occurs only in the Root Chakra, while symptoms are felt in the Crown.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms are used interchangeably in advanced practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "True transformation moves beyond the 'Etheric' layer to the 'Causal' layer, where the original energetic blueprints and karmic patterns reside."

            "question": "During an Advanced Resonant Assessment, a practitioner detects a 'static' or 'grainy' texture in the third layer of the auric field. Which body is being assessed?",
            "options": [
                "The Astral Body",
                "The Mental Body",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mental Body is the third layer of the subtle body system, and 'static' or 'graininess' often indicates rigid belief systems or cognitive loops."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to the 90-Day Chakra Roadmap strategy, what is the primary objective of the 'Integration Phase' (Days 61–90)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The final phase of a 90-day roadmap focuses on integration and anchoring, ensuring the energetic shifts become permanent somatic traits rather than temporary states."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Root Chakra holds the energetic connection to the ancestral line, tribal identity, and inherited survival mechanisms (epigenetic imprints)."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Frequency Anchoring' is defined as a somatic technique. Why is the body's 'Fascial Network' significant in this process?",
            "options": [
                "Fascia has no role in energetic healing.",
                "Fascia acts as a crystalline semiconductor that stores and transmits energetic information and emotional memory.",
                "Fascia is only responsible for muscle movement and does not interact with the chakras.",
                "Fascia is the primary source of Prana production in the body."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Regarding 'Practitioner’s Presence,' what does the term 'Energetic Entrainment' imply in a clinical setting?",
            "options": [
                "The client's frequency will naturally rise to match the practitioner's stable, high-vibrational state.",
                "The practitioner should take on the client's pain to help them heal.",
                "The practitioner must force the client's chakras to open using mental will.",
                "The practitioner and client should have identical chakra imbalances."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Entrainment occurs when a more stable, coherent frequency (the practitioner's) influences a less stable frequency (the client's) to synchronize with it."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with chronic 'imposter syndrome' and a collapsing posture at the solar plexus. Despite clearing the 3rd chakra, the issue returns weekly. What is the likely advanced assessment?",
            "options": [
                "The client needs more yellow crystals.",
                "There is a 'Karmic Leak' in the Mental Body or an Ancestral imprint of 'unworthiness' in the Root that is de-stabilizing the Solar Plexus.",
                "The client is not drinking enough water.",
                "The practitioner is not using enough force during the clearing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recurring blockages in one chakra often indicate that the root cause is in a higher subtle body layer or a 'feeder' issue from a foundational chakra like the Root."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Research cited in Module 12 suggests that clients following a structured 90-day energetic protocol see what percentage increase in 'long-term behavioral change' compared to one-off sessions?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 25%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies on neuroplasticity and energetic integration show that 90-day structured protocols result in over 70% higher rates of permanent habit and frequency shifts."
