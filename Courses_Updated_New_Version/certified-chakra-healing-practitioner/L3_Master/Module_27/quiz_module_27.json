            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Chakra Healing, what is the primary goal of 'titration' when working with a client's energetic blockages?",
            "options": [
                "To release the entire energetic charge in a single session for maximum catharsis",
                "To slow down the processing of traumatic energy into small, manageable 'doses' to prevent nervous system flooding",
                "To focus exclusively on the Crown chakra to bypass physical sensations of trauma",
                "To use high-frequency crystals to force a vibration change in the Root chakra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a somatic integration technique that ensures the client processes trauma in small increments, preventing the 'flooding' or re-traumatization of the nervous system."

            "question": "When working with autoimmune recovery protocols, why is the Solar Plexus (Manipura) considered the 'energetic gatekeeper'?",
            "options": [
                "Because it regulates the physical production of insulin and digestive enzymes",
                "Because it is the seat of personal boundaries and the 'self vs. non-self' distinction essential for immune health",
                "Because it is the only chakra that does not store emotional memory",
                "Because it connects the lower physical chakras to the upper spiritual chakras"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autoimmune conditions often involve an energetic blurring of boundaries. Healing the Solar Plexus helps the client re-establish a healthy sense of 'self,' which mirrors the immune system's job of identifying 'self' vs 'invader.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Executive alignment requires the 'Manifestation Current'—the ability to take a vision (Third Eye), communicate it effectively (Throat), and ground it into physical results (Root)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In end-of-life care, the practitioner helps the client 'loosen' the energetic attachments to the physical body, primarily through the Crown, to support a peaceful transition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the process where a stronger, more coherent field (the practitioner) influences a chaotic field (the collective or a client) to move toward harmony."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy abhors a vacuum. If a cord is removed but the 'socket' or 'void' is not filled with the client's own high-vibrational energy, a new cord (often from the same person) will likely reattach."
