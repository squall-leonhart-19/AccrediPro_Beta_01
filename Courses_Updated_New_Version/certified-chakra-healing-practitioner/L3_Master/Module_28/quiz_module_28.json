            "question": "According to the criteria established by Stanislav and Christina Grof, which feature primarily distinguishes a 'Spiritual Emergency' from a clinical psychosis?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of auditory hallucinations",
                "The ability to maintain an 'observer consciousness' regarding the experience",
                "A complete lack of physiological symptoms",
                "The experience occurring only during meditation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a spiritual emergency, the individual often retains a degree of 'observer consciousness,' allowing them to view the experience as a process of transformation, whereas clinical psychosis often involves a complete break from reality testing."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Muladhara Rupture' following acute trauma, what is the primary energetic priority for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Clearing the Ajna chakra to promote clarity",
                "Opening the Sahasrara to connect with the divine",
                "Re-establishing the 'Energetic Container' and physical grounding",
                "Activating the Manipura to increase personal power"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acute trauma causes a rupture in the root chakra (Muladhara). The practitioner's first priority is 'safety and stabilization,' which involves rebuilding the energetic container and grounding the client before any deep emotional work can occur."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Research into Svadhisthana (Sacral) dysfunction in addiction recovery suggests that the 'reward circuit' (dopamine pathways) is energetically linked to which concept?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Inner Sun' of the Manipura",
                "The 'Flow of Pleasure' and creative expression",

                "The 'Rootedness' of the Muladhara"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addiction often involves a 'hijacking' of the Svadhisthana's natural flow. Recovery requires rebuilding the chakra's ability to experience natural pleasure and creative flow, replacing the synthetic highs of substance use."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narcissistic abuse typically targets the Manipura, where the abuser 'siphons' the victim's power and will. Reconstruction involves reclaiming personal agency and sealing the solar plexus from external manipulation."

            "explanation": "Studies show that 2-4% of patients presenting with symptoms of a myocardial infarction (heart attack) are actually experiencing Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, often triggered by intense grief or 'heart shattering' events."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-frequency overload requires 'down-regulating' the nervous system. This is achieved through heavy grounding (eating root vegetables, walking barefoot) and pausing spiritual practices that stimulate the upper chakras."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In terminal care, the focus is on palliative energetic support, which involves 'unbinding' the spirit from the physical form and ensuring the chakras are clear for a peaceful transition."

            "options": [
                "There is no difference; they are the same",
                "Compassion fatigue is physical; vicarious traumatization is spiritual",
                "Vicarious traumatization involves a shift in the practitioner's world-view and sense of safety",
                "Compassion fatigue only happens to medical doctors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While compassion fatigue is a state of exhaustion, vicarious traumatization specifically refers to the shift in a practitioner's cognitive schemas (their view of the world as safe or just) after being exposed to a client's trauma."

                "Ask them to close their eyes and go deeper into the feeling",
                "Use 'Orienting' techniques to bring them back to the physical room and their body",

                "End the session immediately and leave the room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client dissociates (a sign of Muladhara/nervous system overload), the practitioner must use 'orienting'—asking the client to name objects in the room or feel their feet on the floor—to re-establish safety."

            "id": "q28_10",

                "If the client expresses a desire to quit their job",
                "When there is evidence of suicidal ideation or a complete break from reality",
                "If the client's chakras do not balance after three sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must refer out immediately if a client presents a danger to themselves or others (suicidal/homicidal ideation) or exhibits signs of clinical psychosis that exceed the practitioner's training."
