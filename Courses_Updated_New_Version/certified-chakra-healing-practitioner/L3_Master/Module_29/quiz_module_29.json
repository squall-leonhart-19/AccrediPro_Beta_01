            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "A lack of physical exercise impacting the Root Chakra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multidimensional alignment recognizes that deep trauma can cause the subtle bodies (particularly the astral) to fragment, requiring advanced retrieval and integration techniques."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Dissolution,' how does a practitioner distinguish a 'Karmic Knot' (Granthi) from a standard energetic blockage?",
            "options": [
                "Karmic knots are always located in the throat chakra",
                "Standard blockages dissolve with breathwork, while Granthis require multidimensional clearing and ancestral lineage work",
                "Granthis are only found in clients over the age of 50",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 teaches that karmic and ancestral blockages (Granthis) are deeply embedded patterns that persist across the causal and subtle bodies, requiring more than just basic energetic clearing."

                "Infusion should only be done if the client is in a standing position"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To prevent 'Kundalini Crisis' or energetic overwhelm, Lesson 4 emphasizes that the central channel (Sushumna) must be clear and the client must be deeply grounded before introducing high-frequency pranic flow."

            "id": "q29_5",

            "options": [
                "Because fascia is made of bone and provides structural support",
                "Because it acts as a liquid crystalline matrix that conducts bio-photons and stores emotional memory",
                "Because fascia is only found in the lower extremities where grounding occurs",
                "Because the fascia is the only part of the body that does not hold energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The fascial system's crystalline-like structure makes it the physical medium through which energetic changes are 'anchored' and integrated into the physical body."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves creating specific rituals that protect the practitioner's field and ensure they do not carry 'energetic residue' from one client to the next."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synergy occurs when the practitioner maintains a state of high coherence, allowing the client's energy system to naturally 'entrain' or align with that more stable frequency."

                "Tell the client the session failed and they need to start over",
                "Recognize it as a somatic release and facilitate gentle fascial movement and hydration to anchor the shift",

                "Ignore the symptoms as they are purely psychological"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchoring teaches that physical symptoms post-session are often the body 'off-loading' old frequencies; grounding and fascial support help stabilize the transition."
