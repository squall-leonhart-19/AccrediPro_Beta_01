            "question": "In the R.A.D.I.A.N.T. framework, what is the critical physiological objective of the 'Somatic Anchoring' (A) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the client's primary chakra imbalance through muscle testing",
                "To transition energetic shifts into the physical nervous system for long-term retention",
                "To clear stagnant 'debris' from the outer layers of the auric field",
                "To design the client's three-month pricing and packaging structure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Anchoring is designed to bridge the gap between subtle energy shifts and the physical body, specifically targeting the nervous system to ensure the transformation 'sticks' and becomes a new baseline."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Sequencing, why must 'Dissolution' (D) precede 'Infusion' (I) in a high-level healing protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner's energy is not drained by the client's blocks",
                "Because Infusion requires the client to be in a meditative state only achievable after clearing",
                "To prevent 'energetic overcrowding' where new high-frequency energy is forced into a congested system",
                "It is a traditional requirement of the Vedic texts with no clinical significance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Attempting to infuse energy into a congested chakra can lead to discomfort or a 'healing crisis.' Dissolution clears the 'vessel' first, ensuring the Infusion phase is effective and well-received."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "When conducting an 'Advanced Resonant Assessment' (R), which finding indicates a 'Primary Driver' chakra imbalance rather than a secondary compensation?",
            "options": [
                "The chakra shows the most significant oscillation variance during pendulum mapping",
                "The chakra is located highest in the body (Crown or Third Eye)",
                "The chakra only shows imbalance when the client is talking about their past",
                "The chakra is the one the client feels most comfortable discussing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Primary Driver is identified by the most significant and consistent variance in resonance. Secondary imbalances often resolve on their own once the Primary Driver is corrected."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic fatigue and lack of boundaries. Based on Lesson 3 (Customizing Strategy), which chakra should be the 'Keystone' for their Alignment Strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Heart Chakra (Anahata) to increase love",
                "Solar Plexus (Manipura) to establish personal power and energetic perimeters",
                "Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) to connect with spiritual guidance",
                "Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) to speak more clearly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fatigue and lack of boundaries are classic indicators of a depleted or 'leaky' Solar Plexus. Focusing here provides the 'Keystone' shift required for the client's specific symptoms."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "Lesson 6 emphasizes 'Nourishing Rituals' (N) for autonomy. What is the 'Gold Standard' for ritual duration to ensure client compliance and habit formation?",
            "options": [
                "60-minute deep meditation twice daily",
                "A single 4-hour weekend intensive",
                "Micro-rituals lasting 5-11 minutes performed consistently",
                "Rituals should only be performed when the client feels 'out of alignment'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research into habit formation and the biofield suggests that short, consistent 'micro-rituals' (5-11 minutes) are more effective for long-term neural and energetic rewiring than sporadic long sessions."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "In the 'Total Transformation' (T) phase, which data point is considered a 'Lagging Indicator' of success?",
            "options": [
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) improvements over 12 weeks",
                "The client's immediate feeling of 'lightness' after session one",
                "The practitioner's intuitive hit during the assessment",
                "The color of the client's clothing during the final session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lagging indicators, such as HRV or long-term behavioral changes, show the cumulative effect of the program over time, whereas 'Leading indicators' are immediate session-by-session shifts."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Premium Packaging.' What is the primary psychological benefit of selling a 'Journey' (e.g., 12 weeks) rather than single sessions?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to charge more money upfront",
                "It reduces the practitioner's administrative work",
                "It creates a 'Container of Commitment' that increases the client's physiological and energetic 'buy-in'",
                "It is the only way to ensure the client doesn't see other practitioners"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A predefined journey creates a psychological 'container' where the client's subconscious accepts the long-term nature of deep healing, significantly improving outcomes compared to 'pay-as-you-go' models."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "During the 'Infusion' (I) phase of a session, a practitioner should focus on which specific technique to ensure the frequency 'takes'?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, forceful breathwork to move the energy",
                "Resonant entrainment using sound, color, or focused intention",
                "Deep tissue massage to the affected area",
                "Asking the client to recount their most traumatic memories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Infusion relies on the principle of resonance. By introducing a stable, high-frequency vibration (sound, color, or intention), the client's chakra 'entrains' to that higher state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in Lesson 7 suggests that practitioners who use 'Outcome Tracking' see what percentage increase in client retention?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "22%",
                "40%",
                "Over 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Visual and data-driven evidence of transformation (Outcome Tracking) validates the client's investment and experience, leading to retention rates exceeding 60% in professional practices."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "Which of these is a 'Red Flag' during the Program Development phase that suggests a strategy needs immediate adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "The client feels sleepy after a session",
                "The client experiences a 'Healing Crisis' (temporary symptom flare) that lasts more than 72 hours",
                "The client reports seeing colors during meditation",
                "The client asks for more homework rituals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While a brief 'healing crisis' is common, any flare-up lasting longer than 72 hours suggests the Dissolution (D) phase was too aggressive or the Anchoring (A) phase was insufficient for the client's current capacity."
