            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in the client's body temperature",
                "A tactile sensation of 'magnetic repulsion' or 'static' in the practitioner's palms",
                "The client reporting a visual hallucination of colors",
                "A rapid decrease in the practitioner's heart rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced practitioners use the hands to detect tactile inconsistencies such as magnetic repulsion, static, or 'cold spots' which indicate where the biofield is not properly interfacing with the physical body."

            "question": "According to Precision Alignment (L2), chronic tension in the psoas muscle and lower back is most often a psychosomatic map for which energetic conflict?",
            "options": [
                "Suppressed creative expression in the Throat Chakra",
                "Lack of spiritual connection in the Crown Chakra",
                "Survival-based fear and lack of grounding in the Root-Sacral interface",
                "Over-active intellectualizing in the Third Eye"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The psoas is often called the 'muscle of the soul' and is the primary somatic marker for the Root and Sacral chakras, storing deep-seated survival fears and trauma."

            "question": "When performing 'Energetic Surgery' (L3) on a calcified blockage, why is the 'vibrational shattering' technique used before extraction?",
            "options": [
                "To make the client feel more relaxed",
                "To break the rigid, crystalline structure of the stagnant energy into manageable fragments",

                "To ensure the blockage moves to the Crown chakra for release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calcified blockages are rigid; attempting to pull them out whole can cause somatic distress. Shattering them into smaller energetic fragments allows for a safer and more thorough extraction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '4' count retention in the 1-4-2 ratio is the 'Alchemy Phase' where the high-frequency prana is absorbed and integrated into the physical cells."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without somatic anchoring, the physical body cannot keep up with the energetic changes, leading to 'energetic whiplash' or 'ascension flu' symptoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Toroidal field is a self-sustaining, moving energy pattern that provides superior protection through movement rather than static resistance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alignment Analysis is the second step of the RADIANT protocol, where the practitioner maps the client's current energetic state against their physical symptoms."

            "question": "During a session, a client begins to shake uncontrollably after a blockage dissolution. Based on L6 (Somatic Anchoring), what is the most appropriate practitioner response?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shaking is a natural somatic release. The practitioner should encourage the release while providing a physical anchor (touching the feet/grounding) to help the nervous system process the discharge."
