                "Acute pain in the lower lumbar region after a workout",
                "A temporary fear of public speaking before a major event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ancestral imprints often manifest as 'inherited' survival anxiety or scarcity mindsets that do not correlate with the client's current life circumstances or personal history."

                "Excessive grounding that anchors the energy too deeply into the earth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Energetic leaks in the Solar Plexus occur when personal boundaries are weak, causing the client to 'hemorrhage' personal power and vitality to their environment or other people."

            "id": "q17_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complex grief often causes the chest to collapse slightly, leading to restricted (apical) breathing and a buildup of 'heavy' energy in the pericardium or 'Heart Protector' space."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Co-dependency functions on two levels: the Sacral (desire/need/intimacy) and the Heart (emotional duty/loyalty). Clearing only one leaves the 'hook' of the other intact."

                "To increase the client's vibration to the highest possible level",

                "To open the Third Eye even wider to see the source of the sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequency stabilization isn't about closing down, but about creating a strong enough personal 'signature' that external energies no longer overwhelm the system."

            "explanation": "The integrated approach of the R.A.D.I.A.N.T. Method™ addresses the interconnectedness of the system, leading to a 62% faster stabilization in complex cases."

            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with chronic lower back pain (Root), inability to set boundaries with a toxic ex-partner (Sacral), and frequent loss of voice (Throat). Which chakra should be the priority for initial stabilization?",
            "options": [
                "The Throat, to help them speak up immediately",
                "The Sacral, to cut the cord with the ex-partner",
                "The Root, to provide the foundational safety required to address the other issues",
                "The Third Eye, to gain insight into the problem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the practitioner standards, the Root must be stabilized first in complex cases to provide the 'energetic container' necessary for higher chakra work and cord-cutting to be effective."
