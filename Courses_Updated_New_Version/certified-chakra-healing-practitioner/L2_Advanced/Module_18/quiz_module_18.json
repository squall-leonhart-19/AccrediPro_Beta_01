            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "In the Advanced Resonant Assessment Synthesis (L1), what defines a 'Resonant Shadow' within a client's energetic field?",
            "options": [
                "A total absence of energy in a specific chakra center",
                "A localized frequency drop where one chakra begins to mimic the distorted signature of an adjacent blocked center",
                "A visual graying of the outer auric layer caused by environmental pollutants",
                "An overactive chakra that masks the deficiencies of the lower triangle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Resonant Shadow occurs when a chakra loses its unique frequency and begins to vibrate in 'sympathy' with a neighboring blockage, creating a deceptive diagnostic reading."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "According to Chakra Cluster Theory (L2), which cluster serves as the primary 'Manifestation Bridge' between internal desire and external reality?",

                "The Sacral-Solar-Heart Cluster"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Solar-Heart-Throat cluster (The Power-Love-Expression bridge) is essential for moving an intention from the heart, through the will (solar), and into the world (throat)."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "When performing the Synergistic Dissolution of deep-seated blockages (L3), what is the recommended ratio of dissolution to infusion to prevent energetic 'void' syndrome?",
            "options": [
                "1 part dissolution to 1 part infusion",

                "3 parts dissolution to 2 parts infusion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To prevent the client from feeling 'empty' or depleted after removing a long-standing blockage, practitioners should follow a 1:3 ratio, ensuring the space is immediately filled with high-frequency prana."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "The High-Frequency Prana Infusion Protocol (L4) for the Crown (Sahasrara) center specifically utilizes which breathwork ratio for optimal neural-energetic synchronization?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 1:4:2 ratio is the 'Golden Ratio' for prana infusion, using the retention phase to force energy into the higher cortical structures and the Crown center."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "In Somatic Anchoring (L5), what is the primary purpose of 'Neural Integration' following an energy shift?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the client's physical strength",
                "To convert a temporary energetic 'state' into a permanent personality 'trait' through neuroplasticity",
                "To ensure the client remembers the practitioner's name for future sessions",
                "To balance the pH levels of the physical body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural integration uses somatic triggers to 'lock' the new frequency into the nervous system, facilitating the transition from a temporary peak state to a lasting trait."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "When designing Custom Nourishing Rituals for Longevity (L6), the '3-Layer Ritual Structure' must include which three components in sequence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For a ritual to provide long-term energetic maintenance, it must first cleanse residual debris, charge the centers with new energy, and seal the field to prevent leakage."

            "id": "q18_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity shifts occur when the client stops seeing themselves as a collection of traumas (Victim) and begins seeing themselves as the conscious architect of their energy (Source/Sovereign)."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "In the RADIANT Master Practitioner Synthesis (L8), what does the 'D' represent in the 7-step protocol?",

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a Solar Plexus blockage that consistently returns. Based on the 'Secondary Anchor' theory (L3), which chakra should you investigate as the likely 'hidden support' for this blockage?",
            "options": [
                "The Root Chakra (Lack of physical safety)",
                "The Throat Chakra (Suppressed expression of personal power)",
                "The Third Eye (Lack of clarity)",
                "The Heart Chakra (Grief)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Throat Chakra often acts as a secondary anchor for the Solar Plexus; if the client cannot speak their truth (Throat), the will (Solar Plexus) will remain perpetually collapsed or defensive."

        {
            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "According to the neuroplasticity research cited in L5, how many days of consistent somatic anchoring are typically required to reach the 'Automaticity' phase of a new energetic habit?",

                "21 days",
                "30 days",

                "90 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 21 days is a common myth, the 2009 Lally et al. study cited in the module shows that it takes an average of 66 days for a new behavior/neural pathway to become automatic."
