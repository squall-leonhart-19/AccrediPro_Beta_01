            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the 'Depleted Executive' case study (L1), which chakra triad is primarily compromised by chronic HPA-axis activation and adrenal exhaustion?",
            "options": [
                "The Upper Triangle (Throat, Third Eye, Crown)",
                "The Lower Triangle (Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus)",
                "The Heart-Throat Bridge",
                "The Solar-Heart Axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Lower Triangle governs physical vitality, survival, and personal power. Chronic stress 'burns out' these centers, leading to the physical and energetic depletion seen in executive burnout."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, 'The Silent Heart,' what is the primary energetic consequence of suppressed grief regarding the Throat chakra?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-expression and verbal aggression",
                "Energetic constriction that prevents the 'Heart's Truth' from being voiced",
                "Permanent closure of the Crown chakra",
                "Over-active Sacral energy seeking pleasure to mask pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Suppressed grief creates a blockage in the bridge between the Heart and Throat, leading to an inability to articulate emotions, often manifesting as a 'lump in the throat' or thyroid imbalances."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Spiritual Bypassing' (L3), what is the typical presentation of a client's chakra system?",
            "options": [
                "Over-active Lower Triangle with a closed Crown",
                "Balanced energy across all seven centers",
                "Hyper-active Upper Chakras with significant Root and Sacral disconnection",
                "Deficient Third Eye with an over-active Solar Plexus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spiritual bypassing involves using 'higher' spiritual concepts to avoid 'lower' human emotions or trauma, resulting in an ungrounded system with excessive upper energy and weak lower foundations."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Ancestral Imprints.' Where is transgenerational trauma most commonly 'stored' within the biofield?",
            "options": [
                "The Third Eye (Mental patterns)",
                "The Sacral Chakra (Creative blocks)",
                "The Root Chakra (Foundational safety and tribal identity)",
                "The Crown Chakra (Divine connection)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Root chakra (Muladhara) governs our connection to family, tribe, and ancestors; therefore, inherited trauma patterns are primarily encoded in this center's frequency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "What is the specific synergy explored in Lesson 5 regarding 'The Creative Constriction'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sacral chakra generates creative energy, while the Throat chakra expresses it. A blockage in either 'constricts' the ability to bring creative projects into the physical world."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the 'Power Struggles' case study (L6), a 'Narcissistic Wound' in the Solar Plexus is often an over-compensation for what?",
            "options": [
                "An over-active Heart chakra",
                "A profound lack of basic worth and safety in the Root chakra",
                "Excessive psychic ability in the Third Eye",
                "A balanced and healthy ego"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'inflated' Solar Plexus seen in narcissistic patterns is usually a defensive mask for a 'deflated' or traumatized Root chakra that feels fundamentally unsafe or unworthy."

            "id": "q16_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mental overload causes the Third Eye to spin rapidly but fragmentarily, leading to 'analysis paralysis' and an inability to distinguish genuine intuition from fear-based thoughts."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the RADIANT™ Method (L8), what does the 'A' in the first phase stand for when dealing with a crisis intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Activate the Crown",
                "Assess the Energetic Integrity",
                "Always Ground",
                "Avoid the Heart"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RADIANT™ method begins with 'Recognize' and then 'Assess' to determine where the client's energy is leaking or blocked before applying any intervention."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "According to the statistics cited in Module 16, what percentage of clients presenting with chronic fatigue (L1) show co-morbid Root and Solar Plexus deficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Over 80%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical observations in advanced chakra therapy suggest that over 80% of chronic fatigue cases involve a 'double hit' to the Lower Triangle, specifically the Root and Solar Plexus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "When applying the RADIANT™ method to a client with 'Ancestral Imprints' (L4), which step is most critical for breaking the transgenerational cycle?",
            "options": [
                "R - Recognize the pattern",
                "I - Integrate the shadow",
                "T - Transmute the frequency",
                "A - Anchor the new blueprint"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all steps are used, 'Transmute' (T) is the final phase where the old ancestral frequency is actively shifted into a new, higher-vibrational blueprint for the client's lineage."
