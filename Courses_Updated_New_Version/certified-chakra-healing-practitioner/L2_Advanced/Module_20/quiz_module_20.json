            "question": "When using a pendulum for radiesthesia, what is the standard interpretation of a wide, strong clockwise rotation over a specific chakra?",
            "options": [
                "The chakra is overactive or congested with excess energy",
                "The chakra is open, vitalized, and processing energy efficiently",
                "The chakra is blocked and requires immediate clearing",
                "The chakra is deficient and unable to receive energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In most radiesthesia protocols, a clockwise rotation indicates an 'open' or 'yes' state, signifying healthy energy flow and vitality within that center."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "During a manual biofield scan (L3), a practitioner feels a distinct sensation of 'coolness' or a 'void' approximately 3 inches from the client's body. This typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "An inflammatory response or energetic congestion",
                "A healthy, balanced energetic state",
                "An energetic deficiency or depletion in that area",
                "The presence of an external attachment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coolness, 'holes,' or a sense of emptiness during manual scanning are classic indicators of energy deficiency (underactivity) in the underlying chakra or organ."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client frequently uses phrases like 'I just don't feel grounded' and 'I'm constantly worried about making ends meet.' According to Psychosomatic Intake (L4), which chakra should be the primary focus?",
            "options": [
                "Root Chakra (Muladhara)",
                "Solar Plexus (Manipura)",
                "Heart Chakra (Anahata)",
                "Crown Chakra (Sahasrara)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Linguistic cues regarding survival, safety, grounding, and financial security are direct indicators of Root Chakra imbalances."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In Advanced Biofield Mapping (L5), what does the 'Back' aspect of the Heart Chakra (between the shoulder blades) primarily represent?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to receive love from others",
                "The individual's 'Will' to act upon their desires and self-love",
                "The connection to divine guidance and spiritual insight",
                "The physical health of the lungs and circulatory system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the front of the chakra is often receptive/emotional, the back aspect represents the 'Will' center—how the individual expresses that energy out into the world."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "When using Bio-Well/GDV technology (L6), the 'Chakra Chart' provides data on 'Alignment.' What does a chakra shifted to the left (from the viewer's perspective) typically suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The person is overly focused on the future",
                "The energy is being directed toward the internal/private life",
                "The energy is being directed toward social/external activities",
                "The chakra is completely closed and non-functional"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Bio-Well analysis, shifts to the left often represent an internal or 'introverted' focus of that specific energy center at the time of the scan."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During an Acoustic Assessment (L7), a practitioner strikes a weighted tuning fork and places it near the Solar Plexus. If the sound 'dies out' almost immediately (rapid decay), what does this suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The area is highly resonant and healthy",
                "The client is wearing too much jewelry",
                "The tissue or energy field is dense, congested, or 'absorbing' the vibration due to blockage",
                "The tuning fork is defective and needs recalibration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rapid sound decay or 'thudding' indicates that the energy field or physical tissue is not resonating, often due to significant congestion or blockage."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "The 'R' in the R.A.D.I.A.N.T. Synthesis Roadmap (L8) stands for 'Resonance Check.' What is the primary goal of this step?",
            "options": [
                "To sell the client a set of crystals",
                "To establish a baseline of the client's current energetic frequency and state of coherence",
                "To perform the final healing technique",
                "To record the client's physical height and weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Resonance Check is the initial assessment phase where the practitioner determines the baseline state of the client's biofield before intervention."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Which somatic resonance phenomenon occurs when a practitioner feels a sympathetic sensation in their own body that mirrors the client's imbalance?",
            "options": [
                "Clairvoyance",
                "Bio-Tensing",
                "Kinesthetic Empathy",
                "Acoustic Dissonance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Kinesthetic empathy is the practitioner's ability to 'feel' the client's energetic or physical state within their own somatic framework."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A Bio-Tensors assessment (L2) shows a 'linear' (back and forth) motion over the Throat Chakra. In most advanced protocols, this specific motion indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Total balance and harmony",
                "A 'partial' blockage or a conflict between the front and back aspects of the chakra",
                "An overactive state requiring sedation",
                "The chakra is preparing to change its rotational direction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Linear motion (as opposed to circular) often suggests a 'split' or conflict in the energy flow, indicating the chakra is not processing energy in a unified, circular manner."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "According to the module, why is 'Front-to-Back' assessment (L5) critical for a professional practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "It takes more time and allows the practitioner to charge higher fees",
                "It is the only way to measure the physical size of the organs",
                "It differentiates between how a client 'feels' (front) and how they 'act' or 'will' (back)",
                "The back of the body is the only place where chakras are actually located"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing both sides provides a complete picture of the 'Feeling/Receptive' (Front) and 'Doing/Will' (Back) dynamics of the client's life."
