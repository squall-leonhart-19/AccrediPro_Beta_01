            "question": "According to the foundational ethics for specialty applications (L1), a spiritual director is approached by a directee for guidance who is also a close family friend. What is the most appropriate ethical action for the director?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with the direction, ensuring strict boundaries are maintained.",
                "Refer the directee to another qualified spiritual director.",
                "Engage in direction but only for a limited number of sessions.",
                "Disclose the relationship and let the directee decide if they are comfortable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical guidelines for spiritual direction strongly advise against dual relationships, especially with close personal ties. Referring the directee to another qualified director maintains professional integrity and ensures the directee receives unbiased support, as discussed in L1: Navigating Specialty Applications: Foundations & Ethics."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L2: Spiritual Direction in Crisis, Trauma, and Acute Distress emphasizes a trauma-informed approach where safety, stabilization, and careful pacing are paramount. Attempting to extract lessons or confront trauma prematurely can be re-traumatizing. The director's role is to hold space and support resilience, not to rush the process."

            "question": "A directee is navigating the <span class=\"highlight\">disenfranchised grief</span> of a miscarriage, feeling unsupported and isolated because their loss is not publicly acknowledged (L3). Which action by the spiritual director best supports this directee?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3: Guiding Through Grief, Loss, and Bereavement highlights the unique challenges of disenfranchised grief. The most supportive action is to validate the directee's experience, acknowledge their loss, and create a safe, non-judgmental space for them to process their unacknowledged emotions and spiritual questions. This contrasts with minimizing their pain or offering simplistic explanations."

            "explanation": "L4: Spiritual Direction for Major Life Transitions introduces the concept of liminality as a sacred 'in-between' space. The director's role is not to remove the discomfort but to help the directee embrace this ambiguity, discerning its spiritual lessons and potential for transformation, rather than rushing to resolutions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L6: Integrating Spiritual Direction with Mental Health Support clearly outlines the scope of practice. Spiritual directors are not therapists or medical professionals. Symptoms indicating clinical depression, especially suicidal ideation, necessitate an immediate and strong recommendation for professional mental health evaluation and support. This is a critical ethical boundary."
