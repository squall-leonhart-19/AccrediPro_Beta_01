            "question": "When a client reports profound disorientation, loss of meaning, and a sense of spiritual abandonment, an advanced spiritual director must first discern if they are experiencing a 'dark night of the soul' or a mental health crisis.

                "Hallucinations, disorganized speech, and severe paranoia.",

                "Consolation signifies emotional comfort and ease, while desolation indicates emotional distress and difficulty, both to be avoided.",
                "They are spiritual movements that can indicate divine affirmation (consolation) or a need for re-evaluation (desolation) in relation to a decision, often requiring careful interpretation.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Ignatian discernment, consolation and desolation are spiritual states or movements that serve as indicators.
