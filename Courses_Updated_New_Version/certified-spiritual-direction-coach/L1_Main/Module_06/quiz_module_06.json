            "options": [
                "To impress the client with the coach's aesthetic sense.",
                "To physically and energetically delineate the session from the client's mundane life, fostering a sense of safety and receptivity.",
                "To ensure the coach's personal comfort and preference for the environment.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A spiritual director is approached by a client who is also a close personal friend seeking ongoing spiritual direction. What is the most appropriate ethical action for the director?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with the spiritual direction, as long as both parties explicitly agree to maintain professional boundaries.",
                "Refer the friend to another qualified spiritual director to avoid a <span class=\"highlight\">dual relationship</span> and potential conflicts of interest.",
                "Offer direction but only on topics unrelated to their existing friendship, carefully compartmentalizing the relationship.",
                "Temporarily pause the friendship to accommodate the spiritual direction, resuming it once the client's needs are met."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Engaging in spiritual direction with a close personal friend constitutes a dual relationship, which can compromise objectivity, create conflicts of interest, and blur professional boundaries. The ethical practice is to refer the friend to another qualified professional to ensure the integrity of the spiritual direction process."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "During a session, a client consistently describes their previous spiritual leaders as 'all-knowing' and expresses a strong desire for the spiritual director to provide definitive answers and solutions to their life's big questions. This dynamic is most indicative of:",
            "options": [
                "A healthy and appropriate level of trust and reliance on the spiritual director's wisdom.",
                "A clear sign of <span class=\"highlight\">spiritual bypassing</span>, where the client avoids personal responsibility.",
                "An example of <span class=\"highlight\">idealized transference</span>, projecting qualities of perfection onto the director.",
                "A typical expression of spiritual resistance, as the client avoids deeper self-exploration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Idealized transference occurs when a client unconsciously projects qualities of perfection, wisdom, or omnipotence onto the spiritual director, often stemming from unresolved needs or past experiences with authority figures. Recognizing this helps the director guide the client towards their own inner authority."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Discernment in spiritual direction emphasizes helping the client connect with their own inner wisdom and spiritual guidance, often involving reflective practices, examining spiritual impulses, and integrating body wisdom, rather than offering prescriptive solutions or external directives."

            "question": "A client describes their spiritual journey using vivid metaphors of a 'dark forest' they are navigating and a 'hidden spring' they are desperately seeking. How should a spiritual director best approach this <span class=\"highlight\">complex spiritual narrative</span>?",

                "A guided contemplative practice (e.g., breathwork, visualization) followed by open-ended questions inviting reflection on emergent feelings, images, or inner wisdom.",
                "A didactic approach, explaining common spiritual insights and encouraging the client to adopt them.",
                "A directive approach, telling the client what their insight 'should' be based on the session's themes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Profound insights are often facilitated by creating intentional space for inner reflection and receptivity, such as through contemplative practices, followed by gentle, open-ended inquiry that allows the client's own wisdom and understanding to emerge organically."

            "question": "A client frequently expresses profound, transcendent spiritual experiences but struggles to integrate them into their daily life, leading to a sense of disconnect or 'spiritual bypassing.' Which type of practice would be most beneficial for this client?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Embodiment practices help bridge the gap between profound spiritual insights and daily life, allowing clients to integrate their experiences physically and practically. This fosters holistic growth, preventing spiritual bypassing where individuals use spirituality to avoid dealing with earthly realities."

            "question": "During a spiritual direction session, a client confides that they are experiencing suicidal ideation with a specific, imminent plan. According to professional ethical guidelines for spiritual directors, what is the immediate and most appropriate action?",

                "Remind the client of confidentiality and continue the session, encouraging them to pray for strength.",

                "Encourage the client to focus on positive spiritual affirmations and trust in divine intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Client safety is paramount.

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arriving late, changing subjects to avoid emotional depth, and over-intellectualizing are classic manifestations of resistance. These behaviors indicate that a client may be unconsciously or consciously avoiding confronting uncomfortable truths or engaging in deeper, more vulnerable spiritual work."
