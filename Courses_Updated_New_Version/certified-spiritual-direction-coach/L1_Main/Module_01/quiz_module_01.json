            "question": "According to the <span class=\"highlight\">GUIDE Framework™</span> introduced in this module, which of the following best describes the primary role of a Spiritual Direction Coach?",
            "options": [
                "To offer expert advice and solutions for spiritual dilemmas.",

                "To serve as a spiritual mentor, sharing personal insights and experiences."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The GUIDE Framework emphasizes the coach as a facilitator, empowering the coachee's self-discovery and autonomous exploration rather than providing direct advice, diagnoses, or acting as a mentor."

            "question": "A Spiritual Direction Coach learns during a session that their coachee is experiencing significant marital conflict, which the coachee explicitly states is impacting their spiritual life. The coach has a background in marriage counseling. According to ethical guidelines for professional conduct (Lesson 2), what is the most appropriate action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Offer to provide marriage counseling services to the coachee at a reduced rate.",
                "Suggest the coachee integrates their spouse into future spiritual direction sessions.",
                "Maintain the focus on spiritual direction, and if appropriate, recommend a referral to a qualified marriage counselor.",
                "Advise the coachee on specific communication strategies based on the coach's counseling experience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical guidelines strongly advise against dual relationships and practicing outside one's current scope of competence within the coaching context. Referring to another qualified professional maintains boundaries and ensures appropriate support for the coachee's non-spiritual needs."

            "question": "In deepening inquiry (Lesson 7), a coach observes a coachee consistently avoiding discussion about periods of doubt or spiritual dryness, despite expressing a desire for authenticity. According to the lesson, what is a key focus for the coach in this situation?",

            "explanation": "Deepening inquiry involves exploring all facets of the spiritual landscape, including challenges, doubts, and periods of dryness.

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of coaching efficacy, referenced in AccrediPro Academy's materials, indicates that clear boundaries and adherence to a non-advisory role are correlated with <span class=\"stat-highlight\">a 35% higher coachee satisfaction rate</span> in transformational coaching. This statistic primarily supports which core principle of Spiritual Direction Coaching (Lessons 1 & 2)?",

            "question": "Before an emotionally intense session, a Spiritual Direction Coach performs a <span class=\"highlight\">body scan meditation</span> and a 5-minute deep breathing exercise. This practice, discussed in Lessons 3 and 8, primarily serves what purpose for the coach?",
