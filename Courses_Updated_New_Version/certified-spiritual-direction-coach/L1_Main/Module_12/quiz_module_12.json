            "options": [
                "Strict adherence to a pre-defined spiritual curriculum.",
                "The coachee's immediate comfort through superficial validation.",
                "Creating energetic boundaries, intentional presence, and a non-judgmental space.",
                "Offering solutions directly to alleviate the coachee's distress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing an Advanced Sacred Container involves more than just physical comfort; it's about cultivating energetic boundaries, maintaining deep intentional presence, and ensuring a non-judgmental atmosphere where the coachee can authentically explore their spiritual landscape without fear. This fosters profound safety and trust, which are foundational for deep spiritual work."

            "question": "A coachee frequently uses abstract spiritual concepts (e.g., 'I just need to raise my vibration') without connecting them to lived experience. According to Nuanced Inquiry (L2), which question best facilitates unveiling deeper spiritual narratives?",
            "options": [
                "\"Can you elaborate on what 'raising your vibration' specifically feels like or means in your daily life?\"",
                "\"Have you tried meditation or other practices to achieve that?\"",
                "\"Why do you think your vibration is currently low?\"",
                "\"What spiritual texts advocate for this concept?\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Nuanced Inquiry aims to move beyond abstract language to concrete experience. Asking the coachee to elaborate on the felt sense or practical application of a concept helps bridge the gap between intellectual understanding and embodied reality, revealing deeper, more personal narratives and patterns."

            "question": "A coachee consistently deflects from uncomfortable emotions by immediately shifting to gratitude or positive affirmations, even when discussing significant pain. This behavior, if unaddressed, most closely aligns with the concept of (L3):",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spiritual bypass is the tendency to use spiritual practices, beliefs, or concepts to avoid dealing with unresolved emotional or psychological issues. While gratitude and positivity are valuable, using them to consistently avoid discomfort can hinder genuine integration and growth."

                "Concluding the session, assuming the insight is self-sustaining."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transformative illumination is not just about the insight itself, but its integration. The director's role is to help the coachee explore the practical implications of the insight, how it changes their perspective, and what actions might naturally follow, ensuring it moves from intellectual understanding to embodied wisdom."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A spiritual director finds themselves strongly identifying with a coachee's spiritual path and begins to offer unsolicited personal advice based on their own experiences. Which ethical principle from L5 is most directly being compromised?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Offering unsolicited personal advice, even with good intentions, can compromise coachee autonomy by subtly imposing the director's path or solutions, rather than empowering the coachee to discover their own. It also risks non-maleficence by potentially leading the coachee away from their authentic journey."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-attachment in direction is about the director releasing the need for a particular outcome or solution for the coachee. It means trusting the coachee's inherent capacity for self-discovery and spiritual evolution, fostering their autonomy rather than imposing a pre-conceived path."

                "Distancing themselves from anyone who reminds them of these past behaviors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating shadow and light is about acknowledging and accepting all parts of oneself, rather than repressing or denying them. The director helps the coachee explore the wisdom or lessons within these 'shadow' aspects, fostering self-compassion and holistic embodiment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable practices are those that can be realistically maintained over time. This requires deep collaboration with the coachee to tailor practices to their individual needs, preferences, lifestyle, and capacity, ensuring they are both meaningful and achievable for long-term integration."

                "A natural phase of spiritual awakening."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Attributing all challenges to external forces and resisting internal exploration can be a manifestation of spiritual bypass, avoiding personal accountability and the integration of one's own shadow aspects. A holistic approach encourages examining both internal and external factors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To unlock new perspectives when a coachee feels stuck, the director should utilize open-ended, evocative inquiry. This invites deeper exploration of the 'stuckness' itself, often through somatic awareness, metaphors, or imagery, which can reveal underlying patterns and facilitate transformative insights, moving beyond intellectual analysis."
