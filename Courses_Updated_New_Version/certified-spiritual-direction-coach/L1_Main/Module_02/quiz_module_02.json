            "question": "Which of the following is considered a hallmark of 'Spiritual Presence' in the context of deep listening, as discussed in L1?",
            "options": [
                "Actively formulating advice while the coachee speaks.",
                "Maintaining a state of open, non-judgmental awareness and receptivity.",
                "Interrupting to clarify points and guide the conversation.",
                "Sharing personal spiritual experiences to build rapport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual Presence, as taught in L1, emphasizes maintaining an open, non-judgmental, and receptive awareness. This allows the spiritual director to fully attune to the coachee's spiritual narrative without imposing their own agenda or prematurely offering solutions. It's about being fully 'with' the coachee in their sacred space."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A coachee describes feeling a profound sense of disillusionment and anger towards a long-held religious institution, leading to a complete withdrawal from communal spiritual life. This experience is most closely aligned with which concept from L4?",
            "options": [
                "Spiritual bypassing.",
                "Desacralization.",
                "Spiritual materialism.",
                "Existential angst."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Desacralization (L4) refers to the process where an individual loses their sense of the sacred, meaning, or connection to spiritual value, often stemming from experiences like religious trauma, betrayal, or disillusionment with spiritual institutions. While existential angst is related, desacralization specifically addresses the loss of sacredness in previously held beliefs or practices."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to L6, what is the primary purpose of 'Shadow Work' in spiritual direction?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate all negative personality traits and achieve spiritual perfection.",
                "To identify and integrate denied or repressed aspects of the self into conscious awareness.",
                "To suppress undesirable thoughts and feelings to maintain spiritual purity.",
                "To exclusively focus on past traumas and assign blame."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L6 emphasizes that Shadow Work is not about eliminating negative traits, but rather about bringing denied, repressed, or unconscious aspects of the self (the 'shadow') into conscious awareness for integration. This integration fosters wholeness and deeper self-understanding, rather than suppression or blame."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the context of L5, a coachee experiencing the 'empty nest' syndrome reports feeling a loss of purpose and a questioning of their spiritual identity. This scenario best illustrates the influence of life transitions on the spiritual journey by causing:",
            "options": [
                "An immediate and permanent deepening of faith.",
                "A disruption of established routines and a re-evaluation of core beliefs.",
                "A complete abandonment of all spiritual practices.",
                "An automatic shift to a new spiritual path without introspection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L5 highlights that significant life transitions, such as 'empty nest' syndrome, often disrupt established routines, roles, and identities, prompting a re-evaluation of one's purpose, values, and core spiritual beliefs. This can lead to a period of questioning and seeking new meaning, not necessarily an immediate deepening or abandonment of faith."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "When exploring a coachee's spiritual narrative (L2), what is the most effective approach for understanding their unique belief systems?",
            "options": [
                "Presenting a standardized questionnaire on religious doctrine.",
                "Asking open-ended questions about their spiritual autobiography, significant experiences, and metaphors they use.",
                "Directly challenging any beliefs that seem inconsistent with common spiritual teachings.",
                "Focusing solely on their current spiritual practices, ignoring past influences."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L2 stresses the importance of understanding the coachee's unique spiritual narrative. This is best achieved through open-ended inquiry into their spiritual autobiography, significant life experiences, and the personal metaphors or language they use to describe their spiritual world, allowing their unique story to unfold."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A coachee recounts a recurring dream of being lost in a dense forest, searching for a hidden spring. According to L7, what is the spiritual director's initial role in working with such symbolism?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately provide a definitive interpretation of the dream's meaning.",
                "To encourage the coachee to ignore the dream as it's likely just random brain activity.",
                "To help the coachee explore their personal associations with the symbols (forest, lost, spring) and their feelings within the dream.",
                "To suggest specific spiritual rituals to banish the 'lost' feeling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L7 emphasizes that dream interpretation in spiritual direction is a collaborative process. The director's role is not to impose an interpretation but to guide the coachee in exploring their personal associations, feelings, and connections to the symbols within the dream, recognizing that the meaning is often subjective and emergent from the coachee's inner landscape."

            "question": "In L3, when 'Mapping Spiritual Practices and Disciplines,' a spiritual director observes that a coachee's current practices feel rigid and draining rather than nourishing. What is the most appropriate next step for the director?",
            "options": [
                "Insist the coachee adheres more strictly to their current practices for greater discipline.",
                "Suggest abandoning all spiritual practices until they feel more inspired.",
                "Collaboratively explore the coachee's current practices, their perceived benefits/challenges, and consider adapting or introducing new, more resonant practices.",
                "Recommend joining a different religious community immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L3 advocates for a personalized approach to spiritual practices. If practices are draining, the director should collaboratively explore the coachee's experience, identify the source of the rigidity, and work together to adapt existing practices or introduce new ones that align better with the coachee's current spiritual needs and energy levels, fostering nourishment rather than depletion."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "After several sessions, a spiritual director notices a recurring theme in a coachee's narrative: a deep longing for connection coupled with a fear of vulnerability. According to L8, what is the significance of identifying such 'Core Themes and Patterns'?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates the coachee is resistant to change and needs direct confrontation.",
                "It provides a framework for understanding the coachee's spiritual journey and informs future direction.",
                "It suggests the spiritual director is projecting their own biases onto the coachee.",
                "It means the spiritual director should immediately offer solutions to resolve the pattern."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L8 highlights that identifying core themes and patterns is crucial for synthesizing insights. These recurring elements provide a deeper understanding of the coachee's underlying spiritual dynamics, motivations, and challenges, offering a valuable framework that informs the ongoing spiritual direction process and helps in developing a meaningful path forward."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "During a session, a coachee, 'Marcus' (as referenced in a L4 case study), reveals a history of spiritual abuse that has left him feeling disconnected from any sense of divine love. Which of the following approaches, combining insights from L4 and L1, would be most beneficial for Marcus in the initial stages?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately encouraging Marcus to forgive his abusers to move on.",
                "Validating Marcus's pain and anger through deep, empathetic listening, creating a safe space for his spiritual wound to be acknowledged.",
                "Providing him with a list of alternative spiritual paths to explore.",
                "Focusing exclusively on developing new spiritual disciplines without addressing the past wound."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For someone like Marcus, who has experienced spiritual abuse (L4), the initial and most crucial step is to create a safe container through deep, empathetic listening (L1). Validating his pain, anger, and disillusionment allows the wound to be acknowledged without judgment, which is foundational for any healing or re-sacralization process. Prematurely pushing for forgiveness or new practices can be re-traumatizing."

            "question": "A coachee expresses confusion over conflicting messages from their upbringing and current spiritual seeking. As per L2, a spiritual director could best assist by:",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting they choose one path and commit to it fully.",
                "Helping them articulate both narratives, identify points of tension, and explore how these influences shape their current beliefs without judgment.",
                "Providing a theological framework to resolve the conflict.",
                "Advising them to ignore past influences and focus only on the present."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L2 emphasizes exploring the coachee's spiritual narrative and belief systems without judgment. When faced with conflicting influences, the director's role is to help the coachee articulate these different narratives, identify where the tensions lie, and understand how these elements have shaped their current spiritual landscape, fostering clarity and integration rather than forced choice or dismissal."
