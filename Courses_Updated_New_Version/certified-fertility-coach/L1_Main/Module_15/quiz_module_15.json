            "question": "During an Advanced Clinical Intake, a coach identifies a 'red flag' of cyclic acne, hirsutism, and irregular cycles. Which metabolic marker should be prioritized to investigate the underlying driver of these symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Fasting Insulin and HOMA-IR",
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Serum Albumin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the context of PCOS-like symptoms (acne, hirsutism), assessing insulin resistance via Fasting Insulin and HOMA-IR is critical, as hyperinsulinemia drives the ovarian production of excess androgens."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to Functional Assessment standards, while a standard lab range for TSH may go up to 4.5 mIU/L, what is the 'Optimal Fertility Zone' for TSH when attempting to conceive?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 1.0 mIU/L",
                "0.5 - 2.5 mIU/L",
                "3.0 - 4.5 mIU/L",
                "Exactly 1.0 mIU/L only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional fertility standards and many reproductive endocrinologists aim for a TSH between 0.5 and 2.5 mIU/L to reduce miscarriage risk and support optimal ovulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a Day 3 FSH of 14 IU/L and an Estradiol of 85 pg/mL. How should a Fertility Coach interpret these markers regarding ovarian reserve?",
            "options": [
                "This indicates a robust ovarian reserve and high egg quantity.",
                "High FSH combined with elevated Day 3 Estradiol suggests diminished ovarian reserve (DOR).",
                "This is a normal 'quiet' baseline for the start of a cycle.",
                "FSH is irrelevant if Estradiol is under 100 pg/mL."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An FSH >10 IU/L on Day 3 is a marker of diminished ovarian reserve. Elevated early-cycle Estradiol (>60-80 pg/mL) can also 'mask' a high FSH by artificially lowering it via negative feedback."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "To confirm 'robust' ovulation and adequate corpus luteum function, a Day 21 (or 7 DPO) Progesterone test should ideally reach which functional threshold?",
            "options": [
                "Above 1.5 ng/mL",
                "Between 3.0 and 5.0 ng/mL",
                "Above 10-15 ng/mL",
                "Exactly 40 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While labs consider >3 ng/mL as evidence of ovulation, functional fertility coaching looks for >10-15 ng/mL to ensure the uterine lining is sufficiently supported for implantation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "If a client has an AMH level of 6.8 ng/mL and an Antral Follicle Count (AFC) of 25, what condition is most likely indicated?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)",
                "Optimal Ovarian Reserve",
                "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)",
                "Endometriosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An abnormally high AMH (>4.0-5.0 ng/mL) and a high AFC are classic diagnostic markers for PCOS, reflecting a high number of small, immature follicles."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to a collection of gut bacteria capable of metabolizing and recirculating estrogen. Which enzyme, when elevated, prevents the excretion of estrogen and leads to estrogen dominance?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Lipase",
                "Pepsin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-couples' estrogen that was destined for excretion, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, contributing to systemic estrogen dominance."
        },

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "In a Functional Semen Analysis, 'Teratozoospermia' refers to a deficiency in which parameter?",

                "Sperm Count (Quantity)",
                "Sperm Motility (Movement)",
                "Sperm Morphology (Shape)",
                "Semen Volume"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Teratozoospermia is the medical term for poor sperm morphology (shape). Using Kruger Strict Criteria, a score below 4% is considered sub-optimal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A client’s HbA1c is 5.7% and their Fasting Glucose is 99 mg/dL. Even though these are in the 'high-normal' clinical range, why does the Fertility Coach address this in the Action Plan?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the client from eating any carbohydrates.",
                "Because glucose dysregulation creates oxidative stress that damages mitochondrial function in the oocyte (egg).",
                "Because these levels indicate the client currently has Type 2 Diabetes.",
                "Glucose levels have no impact on egg quality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In functional fertility, levels at the high end of 'normal' (Pre-diabetic range) are addressed because hyperglycemia and insulin resistance drive oxidative stress, which impairs egg quality and mitochondrial health."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "When synthesizing data for an Empowered Action Plan, which of the following represents the correct 'Hierarchy of Intervention'?",
            "options": [
                "Supplements first, then lifestyle, then medical testing.",
                "Advanced IVF referrals before checking basic thyroid or semen parameters.",
                "Foundational health (Blood sugar, Gut, Stress) first, then targeted hormonal support.",
                "Only focusing on the Day 21 Progesterone level."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A functional approach prioritizes 'upstream' foundations—metabolic health, gut function, and stress response—because these factors dictate the environment in which hormones function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' TSH (2.1 mIU/L) but positive TPO Antibodies. What is the primary concern for this client's fertility?",
            "options": [
                "There is no concern if TSH is normal.",
                "Increased risk of miscarriage and potential progression to Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.",
                "The client needs immediate surgery to remove the thyroid.",
                "This indicates the client is already pregnant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The presence of thyroid antibodies (TPO or TgAb) even with a normal TSH indicates an autoimmune process that is associated with a higher risk of miscarriage and 'silent' inflammation that can affect fertility."
