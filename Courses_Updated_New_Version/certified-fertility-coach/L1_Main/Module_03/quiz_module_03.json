            "question": "During the follicular phase, which hormone is primarily responsible for the recruitment of antral follicles and the stimulation of estrogen production?",
            "options": [
                "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Progesterone",
                "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "FSH is released by the anterior pituitary to stimulate the growth of ovarian follicles and the secretion of estrogen by granulosa cells."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "The '90-day window' of egg maturation refers to the transition of a follicle from which stage to the pre-ovulatory stage?",
            "options": [
                "Primordial to Primary",
                "Secondary to Antral/Graafian",

                "Zygote to Blastocyst"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While folliculogenesis takes longer, the final recruitment and maturation phase where eggs are most susceptible to lifestyle and nutritional interventions lasts approximately 90-100 days (the antral stage)."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which type of cervical mucus is characterized by a 'stretchy, clear, or raw egg-white' appearance and is essential for neutralizing vaginal acidity?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Type 4 (Estrogenic) mucus, often called EWCM, provides the alkaline environment and swimming channels necessary for sperm survival and transport."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To confirm ovulation occurred, the standard rule requires three consecutive high temperatures that are at least 0.2°F (0.1°C) above the coverline established by the preceding six days."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase shorter than 10 days is clinically defined as a Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD), often associated with low progesterone and difficulty maintaining early pregnancy."

            "id": "q3_6",

            "options": [
                "The surge of Estrogen stimulating the hypothalamus.",
                "The release of the egg causing localized inflammation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum, acts on the thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus to raise the body's resting temperature."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "When using Ovulation Predictor Kits (OPKs), a 'True Positive' result typically precedes ovulation by how many hours?",

                "2-4 hours",
                "12-48 hours",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LH surge detected via OPK generally occurs 12 to 48 hours before the actual release of the oocyte."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'gold standard' for confirming that ovulation has actually occurred and that the corpus luteum is producing adequate hormones?",
            "options": [
                "A positive LH strip",
                "The presence of EWCM",

                "A dip in temperature on the day of ovulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While LH and mucus predict ovulation, PdG (a metabolite of progesterone) confirms it. Sustained PdG levels for 3+ days indicate a successful ovulatory event."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A 'monophasic' chart—one with no discernible temperature shift despite irregular bleeding—is a significant red flag for:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A monophasic chart lacks the biphasic (low/high) pattern, indicating that no corpus luteum was formed and ovulation did not take place."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Intercourse Timing,' which days of the cycle offer the highest probability of conception (approximately 25-30% per cycle)?",
            "options": [
                "The 3 days leading up to and including the day of ovulation.",
                "The 3 days immediately following the thermal shift.",

                "Any day where Type 1 (dry) mucus is present."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The most fertile window is the 3-day period ending on the day of ovulation, as sperm can survive in fertile mucus to meet the egg immediately upon its release."
