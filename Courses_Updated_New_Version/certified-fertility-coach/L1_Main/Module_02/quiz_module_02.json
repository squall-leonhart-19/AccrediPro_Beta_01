            "question": "According to the psychobiology of fertility stress, how does chronic activation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis specifically impact the reproductive system?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) to compensate for stress.",
                "It suppresses the pulsatile release of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH), potentially disrupting ovulation.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress triggers the HPA axis to release cortisol, which can inhibit the hypothalamus from releasing GnRH in its necessary rhythmic pulses, leading to ovulatory dysfunction or amenorrhea."
