            "question": "According to the Nurses' Health Study II, which dietary pattern was associated with a 66% lower risk of ovulatory infertility and a 27% lower risk of other causes of infertility?",
            "options": [
                "The Ketogenic Diet",
                "The Mediterranean-style 'Fertility Diet'",
                "A low-fat, high-fiber Vegan diet",
                "The Paleo Diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Fertility Diet' (based on the Nurses' Health Study II) emphasizes monounsaturated fats, plant-based proteins, high-fiber/low-GI carbohydrates, and high-fat dairy, which significantly correlates with lower infertility risk."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client with PCOS presents with insulin resistance and high androgens. What is the primary mechanism by which a lower glycemic load (GL) diet improves her fertility?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)",
                "By decreasing the production of Progesterone in the luteal phase",
                "By stimulating the pituitary gland to release more LH",
                "By reducing the acidity of the cervical mucus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lowering glycemic load reduces hyperinsulinemia. Lower insulin levels allow the liver to produce more SHBG, which binds to excess testosterone, thereby reducing free androgen levels and improving ovulation."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which specific antioxidant is essential for mitochondrial ATP production in the oocyte and has been shown to improve clinical pregnancy rates in women with 'diminished ovarian reserve'?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin E",
                "Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinol)",
                "Resveratrol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 is vital for mitochondrial function. Since the egg cell has the highest concentration of mitochondria in the body, supplementation (specifically as Ubiquinol) supports the energy-intensive process of meiosis and embryo cleavage."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In the context of Male Factor Nutrition, which nutrient is critical for preventing sperm DNA fragmentation and is found in high concentrations in the testes?",
            "options": [
                "Zinc",
                "Iron",
                "Calcium",
                "Vitamin K2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zinc acts as a potent antioxidant and is essential for the stabilization of sperm chromatin. Deficiency is linked to low sperm count, poor motility, and increased DNA fragmentation."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to a specific collection of gut bacteria that produces which enzyme, potentially leading to estrogen dominance if imbalanced?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",

                "Protease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted, contributing to estrogen dominance."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "For a client with Endometriosis, which nutritional strategy is most effective for reducing the production of pro-inflammatory Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing intake of red meat and dairy",
                "Eliminating all cruciferous vegetables",
                "Increasing Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) and reducing trans fats",
                "Supplementing with high-dose Iron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids compete with arachidonic acid to produce anti-inflammatory series-3 prostaglandins, which helps reduce the pelvic pain and systemic inflammation associated with endometriosis."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Why is 5-MTHF (Methylfolate) considered superior to synthetic Folic Acid for fertility clients, particularly those with the MTHFR genetic polymorphism?",
            "options": [
                "It is more shelf-stable than folic acid",
                "It is the biologically active form that can immediately enter the folate cycle",
                "It is cheaper to manufacture and more widely available",
                "It prevents the absorption of toxic heavy metals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "5-MTHF is the active form of folate. Many individuals have a genetic variation (MTHFR) that prevents them from efficiently converting synthetic folic acid into the active form needed for DNA synthesis and methylation."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "When designing a bio-individual plan for a client with a BMI of 17.5 and hypothalamic amenorrhea, what is the most critical nutritional priority?",
            "options": [
                "Strict carbohydrate restriction to improve insulin sensitivity",
                "Intermittent fasting (16:8) to reduce oxidative stress",
                "Increasing caloric density and adequate fat intake to restore GnRH pulsatility",
                "High-dose fiber intake to detoxify excess hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypothalamic amenorrhea is often caused by an energy deficit. Restoring ovulation requires increasing caloric intake and fats (cholesterol) to signal to the hypothalamus that the body has sufficient resources to support a pregnancy."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A male client has poor sperm morphology (1%). Which food group should be prioritized to provide Lycopene, a carotenoid shown to improve sperm structure?",
            "options": [
                "Leafy greens like spinach and kale",
                "Cooked tomato products and watermelon",
                "Brazil nuts and pumpkin seeds",
                "Grass-fed beef and organ meats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant found in red fruits/vegetables, particularly cooked tomatoes. Studies have shown that lycopene supplementation can improve sperm morphology and reduce oxidative stress in semen."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "What is the minimum recommended timeframe for a nutritional intervention intended to improve egg or sperm quality before conception or an ART cycle?",
            "options": [
                "2 weeks",
                "30 days",
                "90 to 120 days",
                "6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The process of folliculogenesis (egg maturation) and spermatogenesis (sperm production) takes approximately 90-120 days. Therefore, nutritional changes require at least 3 months to impact the quality of the gametes being released."
