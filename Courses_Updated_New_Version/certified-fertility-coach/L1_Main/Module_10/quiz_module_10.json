            "question": "Which principle best defines the 'Philosophy of Empowered Action' in fertility coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Shifting the client from a state of passive waiting to one of informed agency and proactive physiological support.",
                "Guaranteeing a clinical pregnancy within a specific three-month timeframe.",
                "Replacing all conventional medical interventions with holistic alternatives.",
                "Focusing exclusively on mindset and manifestation techniques to improve outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Philosophy of Empowered Action focuses on moving the client from 'waiting for a miracle' to 'taking informed steps' based on functional data and reproductive literacy."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "When synthesizing functional assessment and reproductive literacy, what does a persistent 'stair-step' rise in Basal Body Temperature (BBT) typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal progesterone production and corpus luteum function.",
                "Sluggish progesterone rise or potential corpus luteum insufficiency.",
                "Excessive estrogen dominance during the follicular phase.",
                "Immediate success in the implantation window."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healthy BBT rise should be sharp; a stair-step or slow rise often indicates that the corpus luteum is struggling to produce progesterone efficiently, requiring functional support."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In Bio-Individual Protocol Design, why is the 90-day 'preconception window' considered the gold standard for intervention?",
            "options": [
                "It takes 90 days for the uterine lining to completely regenerate.",
                "It is the duration required for most sperm to reach full motility.",
                "It matches the recruitment and maturation cycle of the primordial follicles (oogenesis).",
                "It is the time required for the body to fully detoxify from hormonal contraceptives."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because the maturation process of an egg takes approximately 90 days, interventions targeting egg quality (like CoQ10 or antioxidant therapy) require this window to show results."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "During the Strategic Management of the Two-Week Wait (TWW), what is the physiological rationale for prioritizing parasympathetic nervous system activation?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent 'progesterone steal,' where the body shunts pregnenolone toward cortisol production instead of progesterone.",
                "To increase the acidity of the vaginal canal to protect the embryo.",
                "To ensure the body remains in a state of 'fight or flight' to protect the pregnancy.",
                "To lower the basal body temperature to encourage implantation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress increases cortisol; since cortisol and progesterone share the precursor pregnenolone, high stress can lead to a 'steal' that compromises luteal phase support."

            "id": "q10_5",

                "Providing a second medical opinion that overrides the RE's clinical recommendations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach acts as an advocate and educator, helping the client navigate the complex medical environment and make informed decisions alongside their clinical team."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "A client has been on a protocol for 4 months with no change in cycle regularity or mucus quality. According to Lesson 6, what is the most appropriate 'Troubleshooting' step?",
            "options": [
                "Instruct the client to double the dosage of all current supplements.",
                "Pivot the strategy by re-evaluating the root cause, potentially recommending advanced imaging like an HSG or SIS to check for structural blocks.",
                "Tell the client to stop all efforts and wait another 6 months.",
                "Assume the client is not following the protocol and repeat the initial assessment exactly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If markers haven't shifted after a full 90-120 day cycle, a 'pivot' is necessary to look for missed root causes, such as structural issues or male factor infertility."

            "question": "When transitioning to early pregnancy support (Lesson 7), what hCG trend is generally expected in a viable early pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "hCG levels should triple every 12 hours.",
                "hCG levels should remain stagnant until the 8-week mark.",
                "hCG levels should roughly double every 48 to 72 hours in the first few weeks.",
                "hCG levels are irrelevant as long as the pregnancy test is positive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While there is a wide range of 'normal,' a doubling time of 48-72 hours is the standard benchmark for assessing the viability of an early pregnancy."

            "id": "q10_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches do not diagnose, prescribe, or treat medical conditions. Diagnosing a specific disease like Endometriosis is a strictly medical act reserved for licensed physicians."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Synthesizing Functional Assessment,' a FSH to LH ratio of 3:1 on Day 3 of the cycle most likely suggests:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high FSH relative to LH (or an elevated FSH over 10 mIU/mL) on Day 3 is often a functional marker for declining ovarian reserve or poor ovarian response."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A professional roadmap involves building a multi-disciplinary network to ensure the client has access to all necessary levels of care, enhancing the coach's credibility and the client's outcomes."
