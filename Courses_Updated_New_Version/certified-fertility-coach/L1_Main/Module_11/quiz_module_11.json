            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "In the HPO Axis, the frequency of GnRH pulses determines which gonadotropin is prioritized. Which pulse pattern specifically favors the secretion of Luteinizing Hormone (LH)?",
            "options": [
                "Low-frequency pulses (one every 2-3 hours)",
                "High-frequency pulses (one every 60-90 minutes)",
                "Continuous, non-pulsatile secretion",
                "Steady-state secretion without variation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-frequency GnRH pulses favor LH secretion, whereas low-frequency pulses favor FSH secretion. This shift is critical for the mid-cycle LH surge."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Peak Day' mucus (Clear, Stretchy, Lubricative) followed by a temperature rise. According to advanced biomarker literacy, when is ovulation most likely to occur?",
            "options": [
                "Exactly 24 hours before the Peak Day",
                "On the Peak Day or within 48 hours after",
                "Exactly 4 days after the Peak Day",
                "On the first day of sticky mucus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Peak Day' is the last day of fertile-quality mucus. Research shows ovulation occurs on the Peak Day or within the following two days in the vast majority of cycles."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Which Basal Body Temperature (BBT) pattern is most indicative of a 'fallback rise,' and how should a coach interpret it?",
            "options": [
                "A temperature drop below coverline on 7 DPO; indicates failed implantation.",
                "A temperature drop on the second day after the initial rise, followed by a subsequent rise; usually a normal estrogen fluctuation.",
                "A steady decline over 3 days; indicates a thyroid disorder.",
                "A rise of 1.0 degree followed by a drop to baseline; indicates a false LH surge."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A fallback rise is a normal variation where the temp drops for one day immediately after the initial rise (due to a secondary estrogen surge) before climbing again."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "In the context of Metabolic Literacy, how does hyperinsulinemia directly impair the ovulation process in the ovaries?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the pituitary to stop producing FSH entirely.",
                "It stimulates the theca cells to overproduce androgens, which arrests follicle development.",
                "It hardens the zona pellucida of the egg.",
                "It prevents the corpus luteum from forming after the egg is released."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH on ovarian theca cells to increase androgen production. High androgens can inhibit the maturation of follicles, often seen in PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When tracking a client with suspected Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (HA) versus PCOS, what is a primary differentiator in their LH testing patterns?",
            "options": [
                "HA clients show multiple dark LH surges; PCOS clients show none.",
                "HA clients typically show chronically low/baseline LH; PCOS clients often show multiple 'false' peaks or high baseline LH.",
                "PCOS clients always have a 14-day luteal phase; HA clients have 5-day phases.",
                "There is no difference in LH patterns between the two conditions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In HA, the HPO axis is suppressed, leading to low LH. In PCOS, the 'tonic' LH levels are often high, leading to frequent positive or near-positive OPKs without ovulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "According to the WHO 6th Edition guidelines for Semen Analysis, what is the minimum threshold for 'Normal Morphology' using strict criteria?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "10%",
                "4%",
                "1%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The WHO 'strict' criteria (Kruger morphology) sets the lower reference limit at 4% normal forms. Lower than this is termed teratozoospermia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "A client's chart shows a consistent Luteal Phase length of 8 days. Based on Luteal Phase Optimization standards, what is the primary concern?",
            "options": [
                "The egg is being released too early (premature ovulation).",
                "The window of implantation is insufficient for the blastocyst to signal the mother's body.",
                "The cervical mucus is too acidic for sperm survival.",
                "The follicular phase is too long."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase shorter than 10 days (Luteal Phase Defect) is generally insufficient for successful implantation, as the lining may begin to shed before HCG can rescue the corpus luteum."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Rule of Three' used to confirm ovulation via BBT?",
            "options": [
                "Three temperatures at least 0.1°F higher than the previous three.",
                "Three temperatures at least 0.2°F higher than the highest of the previous six.",
                "Three days of fertile mucus followed by three days of dry mucus.",
                "Three consecutive months of 28-day cycles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard thermal shift rule requires three consecutive temperatures that are at least 0.2°F (0.1°C) higher than the previous six 'baseline' temperatures."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "How does the 'Progesterone-to-Estrogen Ratio' impact the Luteal Phase experience for a client?",
            "options": [
                "High estrogen and low progesterone can lead to 'Estrogen Dominance' symptoms like PMS and heavy bleeding.",
                "High progesterone always causes mid-cycle spotting.",
                "Low estrogen is the only cause of breast tenderness.",
                "The ratio has no impact on physical symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Progesterone is meant to balance estrogen. When the ratio is skewed (low progesterone relative to estrogen), it often results in symptomatic luteal phases (PMS, bloating, heavy flow)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "In a 'Data-Driven' coaching session, a client's chart shows high-quality mucus but no temperature rise for 20 days. What is the most likely interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The client is definitely pregnant.",
                "The client is experiencing a 'delayed ovulation' or anovulatory cycle.",
                "The client's thermometer is broken.",
                "Progesterone is too high."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Presence of fertile mucus indicates high estrogen and follicular activity, but the lack of a thermal shift indicates that the LH surge has not occurred or the follicle has not yet ruptured/luteinized."
