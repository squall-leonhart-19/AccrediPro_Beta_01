            "question": "In the Functional Fertility Framework, what is the primary distinction between 'clinical' and 'functional' laboratory ranges?",
            "options": [
                "Clinical ranges are based on the top 5% of the population, while functional ranges are based on the bottom 5%.",
                "Clinical ranges identify established disease states, while functional ranges identify the 'sweet spot' for physiological optimization and conception.",
                "Functional ranges are only used for male fertility, while clinical ranges are used for female fertility.",
                "There is no distinction; both use the exact same reference values provided by LabCorp or Quest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges focus on the 'optimal' zone where the body functions best for reproduction, whereas clinical ranges are designed to identify pathology or disease in the general (often unhealthy) population."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a consistent luteal phase length of 9 days. Based on Lesson 2, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "This is a normal variation and does not impact fertility.",
                "This indicates a 'Short Luteal Phase' (Luteal Phase Deficiency), suggesting insufficient progesterone to support implantation.",
                "This indicates that the client is likely not ovulating at all.",
                "This is a sign of 'Estrogen Dominance' and requires immediate DIM supplementation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase of less than 10 days is clinically defined as Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD), often caused by poor corpus luteum function and insufficient progesterone production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "When analyzing Day 3 labs, a client has an FSH of 14.2 mIU/mL and an AMH of 0.4 ng/mL. What is the most likely functional assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)",
                "Hyperprolactinemia",
                "Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR)",
                "Optimal fertility markers for her age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An elevated Day 3 FSH (>10-12 mIU/mL) paired with a low AMH (<1.0 ng/mL) is a classic indicator of Diminished Ovarian Reserve."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "According to the Metabolic Health lesson, what HOMA-IR score typically indicates the onset of insulin resistance in a fertility context?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR > 1.0",
                "HOMA-IR > 1.9",
                "HOMA-IR > 5.0",
                "HOMA-IR < 0.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges may go higher, a HOMA-IR (Fasting Insulin x Fasting Glucose / 405) greater than 1.9 suggests early insulin resistance that can impair egg quality and ovulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "What is the 'Functional Gold Standard' range for TSH when a client is actively trying to conceive?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 5.5 mIU/L",
                "4.0 - 10.0 mIU/L",
                "0.5 - 2.5 mIU/L",
                "Exactly 3.5 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The American Thyroid Association and functional practitioners generally recommend a TSH between 0.5 and 2.5 mIU/L for optimal preconception and first-trimester health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "How does an imbalance in the 'Estrobolome' (gut microbiome) contribute to Estrogen Dominance?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the ovaries to produce more estrogen.",
                "It produces excess progesterone which interferes with estrogen receptors.",
                "High levels of beta-glucuronidase deconjugate estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream instead of excreted.",
                "It destroys all estrogen in the gut, leading to low estrogen levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome produces beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that 'un-clips' estrogen from its carrier, allowing it to be reabsorbed (recycled) back into circulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In a Male Factor assessment, what does a 'Kruger Strict Morphology' score of 2% signify?",
            "options": [
                "Normal fertility potential",
                "Teratozoospermia (poor sperm shape), potentially indicating oxidative stress or varicocele",
                "Azoospermia (total absence of sperm)",
                "Excellent motility and progression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to Kruger Strict Criteria, morphology below 4% is considered low (teratozoospermia) and may impact the sperm's ability to penetrate the egg."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "How does chronic HPA-axis activation (high stress) directly suppress the HPO-axis (reproduction)?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol increases LH levels too early in the cycle.",
                "CRH and Cortisol inhibit the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus.",
                "Stress increases AMH levels, leading to egg depletion.",
                "High cortisol prevents the gut from absorbing folic acid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HPA and HPO axes are linked; high levels of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) and cortisol suppress GnRH, which in turn reduces LH and FSH signals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client tracks her mid-luteal (7 days post-ovulation) Progesterone, and the result is 6 ng/mL. Is this optimal for pregnancy maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "Yes, anything over 5 ng/mL is perfect.",
                "No, functional targets for pregnancy maintenance are typically >10-15 ng/mL.",
                "Yes, because progesterone fluctuates every hour.",
                "No, progesterone should be at least 50 ng/mL."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 5 ng/mL confirms ovulation, a mid-luteal progesterone level of at least 10-15 ng/mL is generally targeted to ensure the uterine lining is adequately prepared for implantation."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing a Functional Roadmap (Lesson 8), which of the following is considered a 'Foundational' intervention that should usually be addressed first?",
            "options": [
                "Prescription Clomid or Letrozole",
                "High-dose DHEA supplementation",
                "Addressing gut dysbiosis and blood sugar dysregulation",
                "Surgical intervention for endometriosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional synthesis prioritizes 'upstream' factors like metabolic health (blood sugar) and gut health (inflammation) before 'downstream' hormonal manipulations."
