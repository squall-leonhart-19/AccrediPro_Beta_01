            "question": "A client asks you to interpret her recent blood work and specifically asks if she should increase her Vitex dosage based on her low Progesterone. According to the Scope of Practice guidelines in Lesson 6, what is the correct response?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest she double the dose for two weeks and re-test.",
                "Interpret the results but tell her the dosage is up to her.",
                "Explain that interpreting lab results to change supplement dosages is outside your scope and she should consult her prescribing physician.",
                "Compare her results to 'optimal' ranges found in the course and recommend a specific herbal protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fertility coaches must never diagnose, prescribe, or interpret lab results to alter medical protocols. Referring the client back to their physician maintains professional boundaries and protects the coach from liability."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "During the 'Two-Week Wait' (2WW), a client is highly anxious about 'implantation cramping.' According to Lesson 3, when does implantation typically occur in a standard 28-day cycle?",
            "options": [
                "1-3 days post-ovulation (DPO)",
                "6-12 days post-ovulation (DPO)",
                "14-16 days post-ovulation (DPO)",
                "Immediately following the LH surge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implantation generally occurs between 6 and 12 days after ovulation, with 8-10 DPO being the most common window. Understanding this helps coaches manage client expectations during the 2WW."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Data Consolidation' (Lesson 2), if a client's BBT chart shows a sustained temperature rise for only 8 days before menstruation begins, what is the most likely refinement needed in the strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Focus on follicular phase egg quality only.",
                "Address a potential Luteal Phase Defect (LPD) and progesterone support.",
                "Assume the client did not ovulate at all.",
                "Advise the client to stop tracking BBT as it is clearly inaccurate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase of less than 10 days is typically classified as a Luteal Phase Defect (LPD), which may hinder implantation. Strategy refinement should focus on supporting the corpus luteum and progesterone levels."

        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL). What is the standard clinical definition of RPL that usually triggers a referral for a formal RPL workup?",
            "options": [
                "One miscarriage at any gestational age.",
                "Two or more consecutive clinical pregnancy losses.",
                "Two chemical pregnancies in one year.",
                "Any loss occurring after 20 weeks of gestation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While definitions are evolving, most clinical guidelines (ASRM) define RPL as two or more consecutive clinical pregnancy losses, necessitating a thorough investigation into genetic, anatomical, or autoimmune factors."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "When applying the 'Framework of Empowered Action' (Lesson 1), what is the primary shift the coach facilitates for the client?",
            "options": [
                "From medical treatment to 100% natural conception.",
                "From a passive 'victim' mindset to an active 'steward' of their fertility journey.",
                "From tracking data to ignoring data to reduce stress.",
                "From seeing a doctor to only seeing a fertility coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowered Action is about moving the client from a state of overwhelm and passivity into a role of informed, active participation and decision-making in their own care."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5 (Advanced Troubleshooting), when should a coach suggest a 'Pivot' to a Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE) for a client under the age of 35 who has been using timed intercourse with confirmed ovulation?",
            "options": [
                "After 3 months of trying.",
                "After 6 months of trying.",
                "After 12 months of trying.",
                "Only if the client has blocked fallopian tubes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For women under 35, the standard recommendation is to seek specialist care after 12 months of well-timed, unprotected intercourse. For women 35 and older, this window narrows to 6 months."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In early pregnancy monitoring (Lesson 3), what is the expected 'doubling time' for Beta HCG levels in a healthy, viable intrauterine pregnancy during the first 4-6 weeks?",
            "options": [
                "Every 12-24 hours.",
                "Every 48-72 hours.",
                "Every 7 days.",
                "HCG levels do not need to double, they only need to stay consistent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a normal early pregnancy, Beta HCG levels typically increase by at least 60% every 48 hours, or double every 48 to 72 hours. Slow-rising HCG can be an early indicator of a non-viable pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 focuses on building a sustainable practice. Which of the following is considered a 'Leading Indicator' of a healthy coaching business?",
            "options": [
                "Total revenue from the previous year.",
                "The number of discovery calls booked for next month.",

                "The total number of followers on social media."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators are predictive metrics (like discovery calls) that signal future success, whereas lagging indicators (like last year's revenue) tell you what has already happened."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "During the 'Case Study Synthesis' (Lesson 7), why is it critical to review the 'Male Factor' even if the female partner's charts look 'perfect'?",
            "options": [
                "Because male factor infertility accounts for approximately 40-50% of all infertility cases.",
                "Because men's supplements are more expensive and better for business.",
                "Because male factor issues are always easier to fix than female issues.",
                "It is not critical; if the female is ovulating, the male is usually fine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Statistics show that male factor issues contribute to roughly half of all infertility cases. A holistic synthesis using the F.E.R.T.I.L.E. Method™ must include the male partner's health and semen parameters."

        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'Chemical Pregnancy.' Based on Lesson 4, how should the coach explain this to the client to provide both clinical clarity and emotional support?",
            "options": [
                "Tell her it wasn't a 'real' pregnancy so she shouldn't be sad.",
                "Explain that it is a very early miscarriage occurring before anything can be seen on an ultrasound, but it confirms that sperm met egg and implantation was attempted.",
                "Tell her it was likely caused by something she ate during the 2WW.",
                "Advise her that she must wait 6 months before trying again to let her hormones reset."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A chemical pregnancy is a clinical reality confirming that conception and implantation occurred. Validating the loss while highlighting the positive sign that the 'mechanics' of conception are working is a key coaching balance."
