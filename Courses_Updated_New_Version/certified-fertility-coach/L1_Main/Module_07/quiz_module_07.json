            "question": "What is the fundamental difference between a 'Standard Protocol' and the 'Empowered Action Plan' (EAP) taught in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "The EAP includes more supplements than a standard protocol.",
                "The EAP is a static document that does not change for 6 months.",
                "The EAP is a dynamic, iterative framework that prioritizes client agency and real-time adjustments.",
                "The EAP is designed solely by the medical doctor, while the coach only observes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The EAP is defined as a 'living document' that evolves based on the client's biofeedback and life circumstances, moving away from the rigid, one-size-fits-all nature of standard protocols."

            "question": "In the 'Data-Driven Decision Making' model (Lesson 2), which biomarker is considered the 'leading indicator' for adjusting fertile window timing in real-time?",
            "options": [
                "Basal Body Temperature (BBT) rise",
                "Peak-type Cervical Mucus (CM)",
                "Progesterone levels (PdG) tested on Day 21",
                "The previous month's cycle length"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cervical mucus is a leading indicator of rising estrogen and the opening of the fertile window. BBT is a retrospective indicator (confirming ovulation after it happened), making CM superior for real-time adjustments."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Big Rocks' approach in Priority Sequencing, which intervention should be addressed BEFORE optimizing specific antioxidant supplements?",

                "CoQ10 dosage titration",
                "Advanced genetic testing (MTHFR)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Big Rocks' are the foundational pillars—sleep, nutrition, and stress management. Without these, micro-interventions like specific supplements have a significantly lower impact on egg and sperm quality."

                "12 hours",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The '72-hour rule' or Momentum Reset emphasizes getting back on track quickly to prevent a single lapse from turning into a total abandonment of the protocol."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A coach stays within scope by facilitating communication between the client and their medical team, rather than giving medical advice or contradicting the physician."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "A client has seen steady improvement for 3 cycles but has now hit a 'plateau' in their BBT stability. According to Lesson 6 (Troubleshooting), what is the first step the coach should take?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When progress stalls (The Rule of Three), the coach should investigate 'hidden stressors' or 'pivots' that may be interfering with the endocrine system before escalating the intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Window' (early first trimester) focuses on supporting the hormonal transition and early placental development, which requires nutrient density and a regulated nervous system."

            "question": "A client's data shows a sudden 8-day delay in ovulation during a high-stress work month. Using 'Data-Driven Decision Making,' how should the coach interpret this?",

                "The client is entering premature menopause.",
                "The supplements have stopped working and should be replaced.",
                "The body is successfully 'delaying' ovulation in response to acute cortisol elevation (a protective mechanism).",
                "The data is likely an error and should be ignored."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Delayed ovulation is often a sign of the body's intelligence, pausing the release of an egg during a period of perceived 'danger' or high stress (cortisol) to ensure a more favorable environment later."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is achieved when the client has integrated the wellness principles so deeply that they no longer need a rigid protocol or constant coaching to maintain their health."
