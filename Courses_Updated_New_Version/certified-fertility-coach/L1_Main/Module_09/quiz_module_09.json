            "options": [
                "To provide medical advice and rewrite clinical protocols for the patient",
                "To bridge the gap between clinical data and the patient's lived experience through informed empowerment",
                "To act as a legal representative for the client in cases of medical malpractice",
                "To replace the role of the clinic's nursing staff in explaining medication dosages"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrative Advocacy focuses on empowering the client to navigate the clinical system by understanding data and communicating effectively, rather than practicing medicine or law."

            "question": "A client undergoes an Endometrial Receptivity Analysis (ERA) and the result is 'Pre-Receptive' by 24 hours. What does this typically mean for their next transfer?",
            "options": [
                "The embryo transfer should be canceled as the uterus is not viable",
                "The embryo should be transferred 24 hours earlier than the standard protocol",
                "The client requires 24 hours of additional progesterone exposure before the transfer",
                "The client has an infection in the uterine lining that requires antibiotics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'pre-receptive' result indicates the window of implantation is later than average, requiring a longer duration of progesterone (in this case, 24 hours more) before the embryo is introduced."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While IUI can be effective for various conditions, success rates drop significantly (often below 5%) for women over age 40 due to age-related egg quality decline."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Lupron (GnRH agonist) trigger causes a natural surge of LH and FSH but has a shorter half-life than hCG, significantly reducing the risk of OHSS in high-responder patients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Inner Cell Mass (ICM) is the portion of the blastocyst that develops into the fetus; a high grade indicates a robust, tightly packed cluster of cells."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches help clients advocate for evidence-based protocol adjustments, such as switching from a medicated FET to a stimulated cycle, which can sometimes improve lining thickness."
