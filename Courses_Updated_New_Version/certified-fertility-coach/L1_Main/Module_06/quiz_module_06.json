            "question": "What is the primary biological rationale for the '90-Day Preconception Window' emphasized in the Lifestyle Alignment Protocol?",
            "options": [
                "It is the length of time required for the liver to fully detoxify all accumulated EDCs.",
                "It covers the approximate duration of both spermatogenesis and the final maturation phase of folliculogenesis.",
                "It is the time required for the uterine lining to complete three full cycles of shedding.",
                "It is the minimum time needed for a 10% reduction in total body weight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 90-120 day window is critical because it encompasses the full cycle of sperm production (approx. 74 days plus maturation) and the final recruitment and maturation phase of the primordial follicles."

            "question": "Beyond its role in sleep, why is melatonin specifically vital for oocyte quality within the ovarian follicle?",
            "options": [
                "It triggers the release of FSH from the anterior pituitary.",
                "It acts as a potent antioxidant that protects the oocyte from oxidative stress during the pre-ovulatory surge.",
                "It directly converts testosterone into progesterone within the granulosa cells.",
                "It thickens the zona pellucida to prevent polyspermy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin is found in high concentrations in follicular fluid, where it serves as a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that could otherwise damage the DNA of the maturing oocyte."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Which mechanism best describes how xenoestrogens like Bisphenol A (BPA) interfere with the endocrine system?",
            "options": [
                "They permanently destroy estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus.",
                "They bind to estrogen receptors, either mimicking or blocking the action of endogenous estradiol.",
                "They prevent the thyroid from absorbing iodine, leading to secondary infertility.",
                "They increase the half-life of cortisol, leading to chronic HPA-axis activation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA and other xenoestrogens are structural analogs to 17β-estradiol, allowing them to bind to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and disrupt normal hormonal signaling."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client is concerned about phthalate exposure. Which household change would provide the most significant reduction in their 'body burden' based on Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "Switching from tap water to bottled water in plastic containers.",

                "Replacing all wooden cutting boards with plastic ones.",
                "Increasing the use of antibacterial hand sanitizers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are primarily used as solvents for synthetic fragrances. Eliminating 'parfum' or 'fragrance' from personal care and household items is a high-impact strategy for reducing phthalate exposure."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "According to the 'J-Curve' of exercise and fertility, which scenario is most likely to result in 'Exercise-Induced Amenorrhea'?",
            "options": [
                "Moderate walking for 30 minutes, five days per week.",
                "Resistance training twice a week with progressive overload.",
                "High-intensity training combined with a chronic energy deficiency (low caloric intake).",
                "Yoga and flexibility training performed daily."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While moderate exercise improves fertility, the 'J-curve' suggests that excessive, high-intensity exercise—especially when coupled with inadequate caloric intake (RED-S)—can suppress the GnRH pulse generator and lead to ovulatory dysfunction."

            "question": "How does excess visceral adipose tissue (VAT) specifically contribute to 'Estrogen Dominance' in both men and women?",
            "options": [
                "VAT secretes luteinizing hormone directly into the bloodstream.",
                "VAT contains high levels of the enzyme aromatase, which converts androgens into estrogens.",
                "VAT prevents the kidneys from excreting excess estrogen.",
                "VAT stimulates the gallbladder to produce more cholesterol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ. It contains aromatase, which converts testosterone (in men) and androstenedione (in women) into estrogens, disrupting the delicate androgen/estrogen balance."

                "An increase in the production of testosterone by the Leydig cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spermatogenesis is highly temperature-sensitive. Research shows that even a 1°C increase in scrotal temperature can significantly impair sperm count, motility, and morphology."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Which 'Circadian Biology' intervention is most effective for a client struggling with a delayed sleep phase and low morning energy?",
            "options": [
                "Taking a high-dose melatonin supplement at 2:00 PM.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early morning light exposure (photobiomodulation) suppresses melatonin and triggers the timed release of cortisol, helping to anchor the circadian rhythm and improve hormonal timing."

                "The ability of the body to 'delete' all toxic memories during the first trimester."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic transgenerational inheritance occurs when environmental exposures affect the germline (sperm/egg) of a developing fetus, potentially influencing the health of the grandchildren (F2 generation) who were never directly exposed."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "In the 'Lifestyle Alignment Protocol,' what is the 'Hierarchy of Intervention' for EDCs?",
            "options": [
                "Detox supplements first, then lifestyle changes, then medical intervention.",
                "Avoidance/Removal of sources first, then Supporting Natural Detoxification, then Targeted Supplementation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The protocol prioritizes 'Avoidance' (reducing the incoming toxic load) as the most effective step, followed by supporting the body's innate Phase I and II detoxification pathways (liver/gut/skin)."
