            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "The pulsatile release of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) is critical for reproductive function. What occurs when the frequency of these pulses increases significantly during the follicular phase?",
            "options": [
                "It favors the secretion of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "It favors the secretion of Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "It triggers the immediate onset of the menses",
                "It causes the 'Pregnenolone Steal' to occur in the adrenals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-frequency GnRH pulses favor LH secretion, while low-frequency pulses favor FSH secretion. This shift is essential for the LH surge that triggers ovulation."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In Phase I Estrogen Detoxification, which metabolite is considered the 'protective' pathway due to its weak estrogenic activity and lower risk of DNA damage?",
            "options": [
                "4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH)",
                "16-alpha-hydroxyestrone (16-OH)",
                "2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH)",
                "Quinone-estrogen adducts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2-OH pathway is the preferred Phase I pathway. In contrast, 4-OH can lead to DNA-damaging quinones, and 16-OH is highly proliferative and linked to estrogen dominance symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a consistent 9-day luteal phase and spotting 3 days before her period. Based on Module 14, what is the most likely endocrine imbalance?",
            "options": [
                "Subclinical hyperthyroidism",
                "Luteal Phase Defect (LPD) caused by low progesterone",
                "Excessive 2-OH estrogen metabolites",
                "Insulin resistance leading to high FSH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase shorter than 10 days, accompanied by pre-menstrual spotting, is a classic clinical sign of Luteal Phase Defect, often resulting from insufficient progesterone production by the corpus luteum."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "According to the American Thyroid Association and ASRM guidelines discussed in Lesson 5, what is the optimal TSH range for women attempting to conceive?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 to 4.5 mIU/L",
                "Under 2.5 mIU/L",
                "Above 5.0 mIU/L",
                "TSH is irrelevant as long as T4 is normal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the 'normal' lab range often goes up to 4.5 mIU/L, fertility experts and the ATA recommend a TSH below 2.5 mIU/L for preconception and the first trimester to reduce miscarriage risk."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "How does hyperinsulinemia (high insulin) directly contribute to androgen excess in the ovaries?",
            "options": [
                "It inhibits the pituitary from releasing LH",
                "It stimulates the theca cells to produce testosterone and decreases SHBG",
                "It converts progesterone into estrogen via the aromatase enzyme",
                "It triggers the 'Pregnenolone Steal' in the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH to stimulate theca cells to produce androgens. It also suppresses Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) in the liver, increasing the amount of free, active testosterone."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (HPA axis dysregulation) describes a process where the body prioritizes the production of which hormone over sex hormones?",
            "options": [
                "Aldosterone",
                "DHEA",
                "Cortisol",
                "Oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes the production of cortisol (the survival hormone) over progesterone and other sex hormones, as they share the same precursor, pregnenolone."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "When interpreting a functional blood chemistry panel, an LH to FSH ratio of 3:1 in a client with irregular cycles is a strong biomarker for:",
            "options": [
                "Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR)",
                "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)",

                "Premature Ovarian Failure (POF)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While not the only diagnostic criteria, an LH:FSH ratio greater than 2:1 or 3:1 is a classic functional indicator of PCOS, reflecting the endocrine disruption that prevents follicle maturation."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "Which enzyme is responsible for the Phase II Methylation of estrogen, and which nutrient is a critical cofactor for its function?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase; Zinc",
                "COMT; Magnesium",
                "CYP1A1; Vitamin C",
                "5-alpha-reductase; Selenium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme handles the methylation of estrogen metabolites. Magnesium serves as a vital cofactor, along with SAMe and B-vitamins."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Low levels of Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in a fertility context are most commonly associated with:",
            "options": [
                "Excessive cervical mucus production",
                "High ovarian reserve and over-stimulation",
                "Poor egg quality and diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)",
                "The 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone detoxification pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DHEA is a precursor to testosterone and estrogen within the follicle. Low levels are often associated with diminished ovarian reserve and poor response to ovarian stimulation; supplementation is sometimes used to improve egg quality."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "In a client with 'Estrogen Dominance' symptoms but normal serum Estrogen levels, a coach should investigate which of the following first?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive progesterone levels",
                "Phase II detoxification and the Progesterone-to-Estrogen (Pg/E2) ratio",
                "Lowering the TSH to 0.1 mIU/L",
                "Increasing the intake of saturated fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Symptoms of estrogen dominance can occur even with normal estrogen levels if progesterone is too low (poor Pg/E2 ratio) or if the liver is not properly detoxifying estrogen (Phase II methylation issues)."
