            "question": "In the Functional Fertility Framework, what is the primary distinction between 'subclinical dysfunction' and 'clinical pathology'?",
            "options": [
                "Subclinical dysfunction is always asymptomatic, while pathology is always symptomatic.",
                "Subclinical dysfunction represents physiological 'friction' within lab ranges, while pathology meets diagnostic criteria for disease.",
                "Subclinical dysfunction only applies to thyroid health, whereas pathology applies to all systems.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms are used interchangeably in functional medicine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional assessment focuses on the 'gray area' where labs may be 'normal' by lab standards but suboptimal for the high metabolic demands of reproduction."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'mid-cycle spotting' and a 24-day cycle. Based on the Clinical Intake mapping (L2), which hormonal pattern is most likely?",
            "options": [
                "Overt Hyperthyroidism",
                "Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD) with low progesterone",
                "High Ovarian Reserve (PCOS Phenotype)",
                "Optimal Ovulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mid-cycle or pre-menstrual spotting combined with a short cycle (under 26 days) is a classic clinical sign of progesterone insufficiency or a weak corpus luteum."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When interpreting Ovarian Reserve markers, what does a Day 3 FSH level of 14 IU/L typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)",
                "Optimal fertility and high egg quality",
                "Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR) and decreased pituitary sensitivity",
                "Pregnancy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FSH levels above 10-12 IU/L on Day 3 suggest the brain is 'screaming' at the ovaries to produce a follicle, often indicating a decline in ovarian reserve."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Metabolic Markers, what is the 'Optimal' functional range for HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 1.5",
                "Between 2.5 and 3.5",
                "Exactly 4.0",
                "Greater than 5.0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While lab ranges may allow for higher levels, a HOMA-IR < 1.5 is considered functionally optimal for fertility to prevent hyperinsulinemia-driven androgen excess."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Why is a TSH of 4.2 mIU/L considered a concern in a fertility context, even if the lab range goes up to 4.5 mIU/L?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates the client is already pregnant.",
                "TSH above 2.5 mIU/L is associated with increased miscarriage risk and longer time to pregnancy.",
                "It suggests the client is consuming too much iodine.",
                "TSH has no impact on progesterone production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ASRM guidelines and functional standards suggest a TSH between 0.5 and 2.5 mIU/L is optimal for conception and maintaining early pregnancy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to the collection of gut bacteria capable of metabolizing and excreting estrogens. Which enzyme, if elevated, causes estrogen reabsorption?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Lipase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Pepsin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-couples' estrogen that the liver has neutralized, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, contributing to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "In a functional assessment of Male Factor fertility, what is the significance of the 'Kruger Strict' Morphology cutoff of 4%?",
            "options": [
                "Men with 4% morphology are considered sterile.",
                "It is the minimum threshold for 'normal' sperm shape; below this, fertilization rates may drop.",
                "It indicates a 100% chance of successful IVF.",
                "Morphology is no longer considered relevant in modern fertility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Kruger Strict criteria define 4% or higher as normal. Lower percentages suggest oxidative stress or issues during spermatogenesis that may impede natural fertilization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A client has a high AMH (5.2 ng/mL) and an LH:FSH ratio of 3:1. What is the most likely functional synthesis of this data?",
            "options": [
                "Premature Ovarian Failure",
                "Optimal hormonal balance",
                "PCOS Phenotype (Metabolic/Androgen-driven)",
                "Hyperprolactinemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High AMH combined with an LH that is significantly higher than FSH (often 2:1 or 3:1) is a hallmark of the PCOS hormonal architecture."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "How does chronic 'Adrenal' stress (high cortisol) directly impact the 'Foundation of Progesterone'?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol increases progesterone production to help the body relax.",
                "High cortisol can suppress GnRH pulsatility, leading to lower LH and subsequent poor corpus luteum function.",
                "Adrenal stress has no impact on the ovaries.",
                "Cortisol converts directly into estrogen in the gut."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HPA axis and HPO axis are linked; chronic stress signals to the brain that it is an 'unsafe' time to reproduce, dampening the signals required for robust ovulation and progesterone production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "What is the final step in the 'Functional Fertility Roadmap' (L8) before designing a client intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing a high-dose prenatal vitamin.",
                "Ordering more expensive genomic testing.",
                "Synthesizing intake data, symptoms, and labs to identify the 'Primary Driver' (Root Cause).",
                "Telling the client to 'just relax' and wait six months."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the core of the functional approach—connecting the dots between the clinical intake, symptom mapping, and labs to find the most impactful starting point for the coach."
