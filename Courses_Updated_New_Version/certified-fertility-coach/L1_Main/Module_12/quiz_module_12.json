            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Empowered Action' (L1), what is the primary psychological shift required for a client to move from 'passive patient' to 'empowered advocate'?",
            "options": [
                "Strict adherence to a predetermined medical protocol without question",
                "The development of self-efficacy and internal locus of control",
                "Increasing the number of supplements taken daily",
                "Delegating all decision-making to the fertility coach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L1 emphasizes that empowered action is built on self-efficacy—the belief in one's ability to influence outcomes—and shifting from an external to an internal locus of control."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "When performing 'Advanced Functional Data Synthesis' (L2), a client presents with a 'Flat Cortisol Slope' on a 4-point diurnal salivary test. What does this typically indicate in a fertility context?",
            "options": [
                "Acute, short-term stress response",
                "Optimal HPA-axis function and resilience",
                "Chronic HPA-axis exhaustion, often linked to long-term infertility trauma",
                "Excessive caffeine consumption only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flat diurnal slope (low morning cortisol and lack of decline) is a hallmark of chronic stress and HPA-axis dysfunction, common in clients who have endured years of infertility 'survival mode.'"

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Infertility Trauma, what is the clinical definition of 'Chronic Sorrow' in the context of reproductive loss?",
            "options": [
                "A temporary state of sadness lasting less than two weeks",
                "A cyclical, recurring grief that does not have a predictable end point",
                "A clinical depression that is unresponsive to talk therapy",
                "The grief experienced only after a confirmed miscarriage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic sorrow is the recurring, permanent grief experienced by those with ongoing life disparities (like infertility), where the loss is triggered repeatedly by cycles, announcements, or failed treatments."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In 'Complex Reproductive Literacy' (L4), a 'Stair-Step' rise in Basal Body Temperature (BBT) following ovulation is most frequently a biomarker for:",
            "options": [
                "Hyperprolactinemia",
                "Strong, robust corpus luteum function",
                "Sluggish progesterone production or poor follicle maturation",
                "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A stair-step rise (where temps take more than 3 days to reach the thermal shift) suggests the corpus luteum is struggling to produce progesterone rapidly, often due to poor egg maturation in the follicular phase."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 details therapeutic supplementation for Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL). What is the evidence-based rationale for using N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) alongside folic acid in RPL cases?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a sedative to reduce pregnancy anxiety",
                "It increases the thickness of the uterine lining by 50%",
                "It reduces oxidative stress and has been shown in studies to increase live birth rates in unexplained RPL",
                "It is used to suppress the immune system entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NAC is a precursor to glutathione; studies (e.g., Amin et al.) have shown that NAC combined with folic acid significantly increased ovulation and live birth rates compared to folic acid alone in RPL patients."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "During 'High-Stakes Integrative Advocacy' (L6), if a client experiences a failed transfer of a PGT-A 'Normal' embryo, which 'Uterine Factor' should be investigated first?",
            "options": [
                "The length of the menstrual cycle",
                "The presence of Chronic Endometritis (CE) or displaced window of implantation",

                "The partner's sperm morphology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a genetically normal embryo fails to implant, the focus shifts to the 'soil' (the uterus). Chronic Endometritis (asymptomatic inflammation) or timing issues (receptivity) are primary culprits."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "In 'Environmental Detoxification' (L7), why is the 'Half-Life' of Phthalates significant for a fertility coach to explain to a client?",
            "options": [
                "Because they stay in the body for decades, so intervention is useless",
                "Because they have a short half-life (hours/days), meaning lifestyle changes can yield rapid biological improvements",
                "Because they only affect male fertility",
                "Because they can only be removed through expensive IV chelation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and BPA have relatively short half-lives. This is empowering for clients to know that 'cleaner' living can reduce their toxic load within days, not years."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "The F.E.R.T.I.L.E. Method™ (L8) concludes with 'E' for 'Execute & Evolve.' What does 'Evolve' represent in this final phase?",
            "options": [
                "The end of the coaching relationship regardless of outcome",
                "Switching to a completely different medical team every month",
                "The iterative process of refining the protocol based on new cycle data and functional feedback",
                "Waiting for the doctor to provide all the answers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Evolve' step emphasizes that the F.E.R.T.I.L.E. Method™ is iterative; coaches use data from each cycle to pivot and optimize the strategy for the next."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 3 consecutive losses and a high Sperm DNA Fragmentation (SDF) score in the partner (35%). Which intervention from Module 12 is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing solely on the female's egg quality",
                "Advocating for ICSI with Zymot or TESE to bypass fragmented DNA",
                "Increasing the female's progesterone dose only",
                "Ignoring the SDF as it does not impact pregnancy maintenance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High SDF is a known contributor to RPL. Integrative advocacy (L6) involves recommending advanced sperm selection techniques (like Zymot) or surgical retrieval (TESE) to improve outcomes."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Advanced Lifestyle Protocols' (L7), which specific environmental toxin is most closely linked to a reduction in the number of antral follicles (AMH levels)?",

                "Fluoride in tap water",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a significant correlation between high urinary phthalate concentrations and lower Antral Follicle Counts (AFC) and AMH levels, suggesting an acceleration of ovarian aging."
