            "id": "q29_1",
            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Functional Interpretation,' what is the optimal functional range for TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) for a client actively trying to conceive, as opposed to the standard pathological range?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 4.5 mIU/L",
                "1.0 - 2.5 mIU/L",
                "2.5 - 5.0 mIU/L",
                "Under 1.0 mIU/L only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard labs allow up to 4.5 mIU/L, functional fertility standards prioritize 1.0 - 2.5 mIU/L to ensure optimal metabolic rate and reduce miscarriage risk."
        },

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "According to the F.E.R.T.I.L.E. Method™ synthesis, what does the 'R' represent, and why is it critical for the neuro-endocrine axis?",
            "options": [
                "Restoration; it focuses on sleep hygiene only.",
                "Regulation; it focuses on glucose management.",
                "Resilience; it addresses the HPA axis to prevent cortisol-induced GnRH suppression.",
                "Reproduction; it focuses on the timing of intercourse."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resilience refers to emotional and physiological stress management. High cortisol levels inhibit the pulsatile release of GnRH, which disrupts the entire HPO axis."

        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "When supporting a client through 'Precision Nutrition' for mitochondrial rescue, which antioxidant is specifically noted for its role in meiotic spindle assembly and ATP production in the oocyte?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinol)",
                "Folic Acid",
                "Iron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 (specifically in its active Ubiquinol form) is essential for the mitochondria to produce ATP, which is required for the energy-intensive process of chromosomal division (meiotic spindle assembly)."

        {
            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "In 'Integrative Advocacy,' how should a coach handle a situation where a client's PGT-A results show a 'Euploid' embryo but the client has had two previous implantation failures?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest the client find a new doctor immediately.",
                "Advise the client that PGT-A is 100% accurate and the issue is purely psychological.",
                "Advocate for 'Uterine Environment' investigation, such as chronic endometritis or receptivity testing (ERA).",
                "Tell the client to increase their prenatal vitamin dosage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A euploid embryo (chromosomally normal) does not guarantee pregnancy; advocacy involves looking at the 'soil' (uterus/immune system) when the 'seed' (embryo) is confirmed healthy."

        {
            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 5 suggests that what percentage of oocyte quality issues may be attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 20%",
                "Approximately 40%",
                "Up to 70%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that up to 70% of age-related oocyte decline is linked to mitochondrial decay and the resulting inability to complete meiosis correctly."

        {
            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "In Navigating Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL), what is the 'Functional' threshold for Ferritin levels to support oxygenation and cellular energy for early pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "10 - 20 ng/mL",
                "Over 150 ng/mL",
                "50 - 100 ng/mL",
                "Any level within the lab's normal range"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While labs often accept Ferritin as low as 12 ng/mL, functional fertility requires 50-100 ng/mL to ensure adequate iron stores for fetal development and maternal thyroid function."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "The 'Epigenetic Environment' (Lesson 6) emphasizes that the paternal contribution to the embryo's health is determined by lifestyle factors during which timeframe?",
            "options": [
                "The 24 hours prior to conception.",
                "The 72-90 days of the spermatogenesis cycle.",
                "Only the childhood health of the father.",
                "Paternal health does not have an epigenetic impact."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sperm take approximately 72-90 days to mature, making the three months prior to conception the 'epigenetic window' for paternal lifestyle interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "Which neuro-endocrine signal is often called the 'Safe to Conceive' signal, which can be inhibited by chronic caloric restriction or excessive exercise?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin",
                "Melatonin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Leptin, produced by adipose tissue, signals the hypothalamus that there is enough energy (fat stores) to support a pregnancy. Low leptin inhibits GnRH."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "When designing a '12-Month Mastery Roadmap,' why is the first 90 days designated as the 'Priming Phase'?",
            "options": [
                "To wait for the client's insurance to kick in.",
                "Because it takes 90 days for an oocyte to transition from a primordial state to ovulation, allowing for epigenetic influence.",
                "To ensure the coach and client have time to build rapport.",
                "Because most clients get pregnant within 30 days anyway."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '90-day egg cycle' is the critical window where the developing follicle is susceptible to nutritional, hormonal, and environmental changes."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Unexplained Infertility' but her Progesterone is 8 ng/mL seven days post-ovulation. How would a Master Coach interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "This is perfectly normal and needs no intervention.",
                "This is a 'Functional Deficiency'; levels should ideally be >15 ng/mL to support implantation.",
                "This indicates she did not ovulate at all.",
                "This suggests she is already pregnant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional interpretation looks for optimal levels. Progesterone below 10-15 ng/mL in the mid-luteal phase suggests sub-optimal corpus luteum function, which can hinder implantation."
