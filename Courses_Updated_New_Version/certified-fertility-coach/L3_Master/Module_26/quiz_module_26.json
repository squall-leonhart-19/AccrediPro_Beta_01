            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A short follicular phase combined with elevated Day 3 FSH is a significant indicator of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and requires immediate protocol adjustment or referral."

            "question": "According to the framework for 'Integrating Reproductive Literacy' (L4), why is tracking Basal Body Temperature (BBT) considered a 'Functional Vital Sign'?",
            "options": [
                "It predicts the exact moment of ovulation 48 hours in advance",
                "It serves as a proxy for progesterone production and metabolic health",
                "It is the only way to confirm a pregnancy before a missed period",
                "It eliminates the need for any clinical blood work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BBT is a functional vital sign because the thermal shift confirms ovulation and the sustained high temperature reflects the thermogenic effect of progesterone and thyroid function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because folliculogenesis (the maturation of the egg) takes approximately 90 days, a 3-month 'washout' and nutrient-loading period is the gold standard for improving egg quality."
