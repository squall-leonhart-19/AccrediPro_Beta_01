            "question": "According to the ASRM and ESHRE guidelines discussed in Lesson 1, what is the current clinical definition of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL)?",
            "options": [
                "Three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks gestation.",
                "Two or more documented pregnancy losses, not necessarily consecutive.",
                "Any loss occurring after a successful live birth followed by two subsequent losses.",
                "Two or more losses occurring only after the 12th week of gestation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern clinical guidelines (ASRM) now define RPL as two or more failed clinical pregnancies, acknowledging that the risk of a third loss after two is nearly as high as after three."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, Adenomyosis is distinguished from Endometriosis by which specific physiological characteristic?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the pelvic cavity.",
                "The growth of endometrial-like tissue within the myometrium (muscular wall) of the uterus.",
                "The formation of chocolate cysts specifically on the ovaries.",
                "The presence of superficial lesions on the peritoneal lining."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adenomyosis is often called 'endometriosis of the uterus' because it involves the invasion of the endometrial lining into the myometrium, leading to a 'globular' or enlarged uterus."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "When coaching a client through 'Failed ART Analysis' (Lesson 3), what does the term 'Euploid Gap' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The time delay between egg retrieval and the PGT-A results.",
                "The difference between the number of eggs retrieved and the number of blastocysts formed.",
                "The statistical discrepancy between the expected number of chromosomally normal embryos based on age and the actual results obtained.",
                "The cost difference between a standard IVF cycle and a PGT-A cycle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Euploid Gap is a critical analysis tool used to determine if a failure was due to egg/sperm quality (embryo issue) or if the results were significantly lower than age-based norms, suggesting a need for a protocol pivot."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client presents with an AMH of 0.4 ng/mL and an Antral Follicle Count (AFC) of 4. According to Lesson 4, which framework should the coach use for 'High-Stakes' DOR coaching?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Quantity over Quality' framework, focusing on high-dose stimulation.",
                "The 'Wait and See' approach, recommending 6 months of natural supplements.",
                "The 'Quality over Quantity' framework, emphasizing protocol nuances like 'Mini-IVF' or banking embryos.",
                "Immediate referral to donor eggs as the only viable biological option."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR), coaching focuses on maximizing the quality of the few eggs available, often through low-stimulation protocols or embryo banking, rather than aggressive high-dose protocols that may fry the eggs."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI). At what percentage does DFI typically begin to significantly impact IVF success rates and increase miscarriage risk?",
            "options": [
                "Above 5%",
                "Above 15%",
                "Above 30%",
                "Above 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A DFI of >30% is considered high fragmentation and is clinically associated with lower fertilization rates, poorer embryo quality, and a higher risk of pregnancy loss."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Social Isolation Paradox' identified in Lesson 6 regarding Secondary Infertility?",
            "options": [
                "The client is isolated because they have no friends with children.",
                "The client feels 'too fertile' for the primary infertility community but 'not fertile enough' for the parenting community.",
                "The client isolates themselves to spend more time with their existing child.",
                "The client's medical team ignores them because they already have a child."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary infertility clients often experience a unique form of isolation where they feel like 'traitors' in infertility groups because they have a child, yet they cannot relate to their 'fertile' friends who are easily expanding their families."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In the context of Third-Party Reproduction (Lesson 7), what is the primary difference between 'Traditional' and 'Gestational' surrogacy?",
            "options": [
                "Traditional uses the surrogate's own egg; Gestational uses an egg from the intended parent or a donor.",
                "Traditional is done via home insemination; Gestational is done in a clinic.",
                "Traditional is legal in all 50 states; Gestational is not.",
                "Traditional involves a relative; Gestational involves a stranger."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Traditional surrogacy involves the surrogate providing the genetic material (egg), whereas in gestational surrogacy, the surrogate has no genetic link to the baby."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "When a client is 'Transitioning to Child-Free' (Lesson 8), what is the 'Meaning-Making' phase of coaching focused on?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meaning-making is the final stage of the 'End of the Road' framework, where the coach helps the client reconstruct an identity that is not defined by infertility or the absence of children."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client with Advanced Endometriosis (Stage IV) is experiencing repeated implantation failure despite having euploid embryos. Based on Lesson 2, what investigation should the coach suggest discussing with their RE?",
            "options": [
                "A standard pelvic ultrasound.",
                "Suppression therapy (like Lupron Depot) or an ERA/ReceptivaDx test.",
                "Increasing the dosage of Progesterone.",
                "Switching to a natural cycle transfer immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stage IV endometriosis creates an inflammatory environment. Suppression with GnRH agonists (Lupron) for 2 months prior to transfer is a common 'pivot' strategy to improve receptivity."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "Which psychological dynamic is most prevalent in 'Complex Male Factor' cases involving Azoospermia, as discussed in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Protector' complex, where the male partner feels fine but the female partner is anxious.",

                "Relief that the 'problem' has been identified."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Male factor infertility, especially azoospermia (zero sperm count), often carries a heavy burden of shame and emasculation, leading to 'silent grief' where the man may withdraw from the coaching process."
