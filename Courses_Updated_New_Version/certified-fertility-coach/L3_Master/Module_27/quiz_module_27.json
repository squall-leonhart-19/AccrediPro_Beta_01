            "question": "In Advanced Maternal Age (AMA) coaching, which mitochondrial-targeted nutrient has been shown in clinical trials to improve oocyte maturation rates by supporting ATP production?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin (3mg)",
                "Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinol) at 600-800mg daily",

                "Vitamin D3 (1000 IU)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-dose CoQ10 (specifically Ubiquinol) is the gold standard for mitochondrial optimization in AMA, as it directly supports the electron transport chain and ATP production in the oocyte."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A client with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) tests positive for Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). What is the primary physiological mechanism that causes pregnancy loss in these cases?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "APS is an autoimmune condition that causes a 'sticky blood' state (hypercoagulability), leading to micro-clots in the developing placenta which results in pregnancy loss."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Regarding Severe Male Factor, a Sperm DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI) above what percentage is clinically associated with a significant decrease in IUI success and increased miscarriage risk?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A DFI of >30% is considered high and is associated with significantly poorer outcomes in natural conception and IUI, often necessitating ICSI or advanced sperm selection techniques."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Even lean PCOS patients often exhibit postprandial hyperinsulinemia (insulin resistance), which drives ovarian androgen production despite a normal BMI."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Endometriosis is increasingly characterized as a condition of 'Progesterone Resistance.' What is the consequence of this resistance in the uterine environment?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone resistance in endometriosis means the lining does not respond correctly to progesterone, leading to a failure of the decidualization process and a disrupted implantation window."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In the context of Third-Party Reproduction (Donor Egg), what is a key educational point a coach should provide regarding epigenetics?",
            "options": [
                "The birth mother has no biological influence on the child",
                "The uterine environment and microRNAs in the endometrial fluid can influence gene expression in the embryo",
                "DNA from the birth mother is physically integrated into the embryo's genome",
                "Epigenetics only matters in cases of sperm donation, not egg donation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that the birth mother’s uterine environment (including microRNAs) can influence the expression of the child's genes, a process known as 'epigenetic signaling.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary infertility often involves a 'double bind' of guilt, where parents feel they shouldn't complain because they already have a child, leading to isolation and 'silent grief.'"
