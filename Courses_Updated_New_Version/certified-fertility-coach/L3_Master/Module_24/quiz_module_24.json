            "options": ["F (Functional)", "R (Reproductive)", "T (Toxicological)", "E (Epigenetic)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'T' in the F.E.R.T.I.L.E. framework stands for Toxicological, which involves evaluating environmental exposures and the client's total toxic load."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "When interpreting functional labs for a preconception client, while the standard clinical range for TSH may go up to 4.5 mIU/L, what is the 'Master Practitioner' optimal range for fertility?",
            "options": ["0.5 - 2.5 mIU/L", "1.0 - 4.0 mIU/L", "2.5 - 5.0 mIU/L", "Below 1.0 mIU/L only"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In functional fertility coaching, TSH is ideally kept between 0.5 and 2.5 mIU/L to reduce miscarriage risk and support optimal ovulation."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A client presents with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) and tests positive for elevated Natural Killer (NK) cell activity. This falls under which category of Master Practitioner skills?",
            "options": ["Nutrigenomics", "Reproductive Immunology", "Somatic Coaching", "Precision Advocacy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated NK cell activity is a key focus of Reproductive Immunology, as it can lead to an overactive immune response against the embryo."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "During a session, a client becomes extremely agitated and starts breathing rapidly while discussing their upcoming embryo transfer. According to Polyvagal Theory, which state have they entered?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)", "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown)", "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)", "Functional Freeze"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Agitation and rapid breathing are physiological markers of the Sympathetic nervous system's 'Fight or Flight' response."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "A Master Coach identifies a 'slow rise' pattern and a 9-day luteal phase on a client's BBT chart. Which sub-clinical pathology is most likely present?",
            "options": ["Estrogen Dominance", "Luteal Phase Deficiency (Progesterone insufficiency)", "PCOS-related Anovulation", "Premature Ovarian Failure"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A short luteal phase (under 10 days) and a slow temperature rise after ovulation are classic indicators of Luteal Phase Deficiency or insufficient progesterone production."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "A client has a homozygous COMT (rs4680) polymorphism. As a Master Coach, which lifestyle/nutritional focus is most relevant for their fertility?",
            "options": ["Increasing caffeine intake to boost metabolism", "Supporting estrogen detoxification and phase II liver clearance", "Avoiding all forms of folate", "Focusing exclusively on Vitamin D absorption"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT gene is responsible for the methylation of estrogens; a polymorphism here can slow down estrogen clearance, potentially leading to estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "In 'High-Stakes Advocacy,' what is the coach's primary responsibility when a client is considering PGT-A (Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy)?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches do not diagnose or prescribe; they educate and provide tools for better communication between the client and their medical providers."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "According to the principles of Precision Nutrigenomics, why is the MTHFR C677T polymorphism significant in fertility?",
            "options": ["It prevents the absorption of Vitamin C", "It impairs the conversion of synthetic folic acid into active 5-MTHF", "It causes immediate fallopian tube blockage", "It is the primary cause of gestational diabetes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR mutation affects the enzyme responsible for converting folate into its active form, which is critical for DNA methylation and preventing neural tube defects."
