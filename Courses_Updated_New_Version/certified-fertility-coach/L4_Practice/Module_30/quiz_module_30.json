            "question": "In Lesson 1, why is 'General Fertility Coaching' identified as a strategic error for high-ticket practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "It requires too many certifications to maintain.",
                "It leads to 'commodity pricing' where you are compared solely on price rather than specialized outcomes.",
                "General coaching is illegal in most jurisdictions without a medical license.",
                "There is no demand for general fertility support in the current market."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generalists are viewed as a commodity. By defining a specific high-ticket niche (e.g., PCOS for over 35s), you position yourself as an expert, allowing for premium pricing based on specialized value."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never prescribe or adjust medical dosages. Doing so violates legal frameworks and scope of practice, potentially leading to significant legal liability."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Medical clinics are incentivized by patient outcomes and efficiency. Showing that coached patients are more compliant and less likely to quit treatment makes you a valuable asset to the clinic's bottom line."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-ticket enrollment is about helping the client see the value of the transformation. Exploring the 'cost of inaction' helps the client decide if the investment is worth the potential outcome."
