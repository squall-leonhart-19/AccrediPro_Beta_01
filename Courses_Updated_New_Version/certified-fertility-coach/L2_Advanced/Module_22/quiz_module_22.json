            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inclusivity in fertility involves recognizing that not all individuals seeking to conceive identify as 'women' or 'mothers,' and using inclusive language fosters a safe, ethical environment for all family structures."

            "question": "A coach's website claims: 'My 12-week program has a 90% success rate for PCOS reversal.' Why is this statement ethically problematic?",
            "options": [
                "Because 90% is too low of a number",
                "Because PCOS cannot be cured, only managed, and 'success' is often ill-defined and misleading in marketing",
                "Because the coach should have claimed 100% success",
                "It is not problematic as long as the coach has 10 testimonials"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Marketing ethics require transparency. Claiming to 'reverse' a chronic condition or guaranteeing specific pregnancy outcomes is misleading and violates the principle of evidence-based transparency."

                "'Ignore the labs; doctors use incorrect ranges for fertility.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A coach can identify that a value is outside of the optimal or reference range and explain its general impact on fertility, but they must never provide a medical diagnosis."
