            "question": "The 'Evidence-Based Practice' (EBP) triad used in professional fertility coaching consists of which three components?",
            "options": [
                "Social media trends, anecdotal success stories, and supplement manufacturer data",
                "Best research evidence, clinical expertise/coach experience, and client values/circumstances",
                "Peer-reviewed journals, government health mandates, and historical traditional medicine",
                "Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and expert opinion only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBP is defined as the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise and the unique values and circumstances of the client."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "When appraising reproductive literature, why is 'Absolute Risk Reduction' (ARR) often more clinically useful than 'Relative Risk Reduction' (RRR)?",
            "options": [
                "ARR always shows a larger number, making the intervention seem more effective to the client",
                "RRR is only used in animal studies, whereas ARR is used for human clinical trials",
                "ARR reflects the actual difference in event rates between groups, preventing the exaggeration of small benefits",
                "ARR accounts for the cost of the intervention, while RRR only accounts for biological outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Relative Risk can be misleading if the baseline risk is very low; Absolute Risk Reduction provides a clearer picture of the actual impact an intervention will have on an individual's outcome."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mitochondria provide the ATP necessary for oocyte maturation, spindle assembly, and early embryonic development; mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary driver of age-related infertility."

            "options": [
                "Replacing animal protein with plant protein sources was associated with a significantly lower risk of ovulatory infertility",
                "High intake of red meat improved ovulation rates by increasing iron stores",
                "Protein source had no measurable impact on fertility as long as total caloric intake was stable",
                "Whey protein isolate was the most effective protein source for improving follicular fluid quality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The study found that women who consumed more plant-based protein instead of animal-based protein had a significantly lower risk of infertility due to ovulatory disorders."

            "options": [
                "It is the time it takes for the liver to detoxify heavy metals",
                "It represents the full cycle of spermatogenesis, meaning toxin exposure during this time affects the current sperm batch",
                "It is the duration required for Phthalates to be fully excreted from adipose tissue",
                "It is the time required for DNA fragmentation to naturally repair itself without intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spermatogenesis takes approximately 74-90 days; therefore, lifestyle changes and toxin avoidance must be maintained for at least one full cycle to see improvements in sperm parameters."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol and CRH (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone) can inhibit the GnRH pulse generator in the hypothalamus, leading to downstream disruption of LH and FSH."

            "options": [
                "The total number of babies born in a specific zip code over one year",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CLBR is a more modern and comprehensive metric that accounts for the total success potential of a single stimulated retrieval cycle, rather than just the first transfer."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A client presents a study claiming that 'Supplement X' increases pregnancy rates by 50%. Upon critical appraisal, you see the 'n' value is 12. Why is this significant?",
            "options": [
                "The 'n' value represents the cost, and 12 is very expensive",
                "The 'n' value is the sample size; a sample of 12 is too small to generalize results to the broader population",
                "The 'n' value is the number of researchers; 12 indicates a high-quality multi-center trial",
                "The 'n' value refers to the number of months the study lasted; 12 months is the gold standard"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Small sample sizes (low 'n') increase the risk of 'Type I' errors (false positives) and lack the statistical power to ensure the results aren't due to chance."

            "question": "According to the 2018 study by Karayiannis et al. regarding the Mediterranean Diet and IVF, women in the highest adherence group had how much higher likelihood of achieving a live birth compared to the lowest adherence group?",

                "To ensure the coach makes all final medical decisions for the client",
                "To allow the client to choose any treatment they want, regardless of evidence",
                "To combine the best clinical evidence with the client's personal preferences and values to reach an informed choice",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shared Decision-Making (SDM) is the pinnacle of evidence-based coaching, ensuring the client is an active participant who understands the risks/benefits and how they align with their personal goals."
