            "question": "In the F.E.R.T.I.L.E. Framework discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary focus of the 'T' (Transformation) phase in complex cases?",
            "options": [
                "The physical detoxification of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs).",
                "Shifting the client's identity from 'infertile' to 'proactively fertile' through mindset and habit overhaul.",

                "The biochemical conversion of testosterone to estrogen in the granulosa cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Transformation phase focuses on the psychological and behavioral shift, moving the client away from a deficit-based identity toward an empowered, proactive state of health."

            "question": "When performing Advanced Functional Synthesis (Lesson 2), a coach notices a client has high 16α-OHE1 levels and low 2-OH-E1 levels on a DUTCH test. What is the most appropriate integrative suggestion?",
            "options": [
                "Increase intake of cruciferous vegetables and consider DIM to support the 2-OH pathway.",
                "Immediately recommend a high-dose progesterone cream to balance estrogen dominance.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High 16-hydroxyestrone relative to 2-hydroxyestrone indicates a less favorable estrogen metabolism pathway; cruciferous vegetables and DIM support the 'cleaner' 2-OH pathway (Phase I detoxification)."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to the Psychosomatic Bridge (Lesson 3), how does chronic HPA-axis activation specifically impact the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis?",
            "options": [
                "It increases LH pulse frequency, leading to premature ovulation.",
                "It stimulates the overproduction of FSH, causing early follicular depletion.",
                "Cortisol and CRH inhibit the secretion of GnRH, potentially leading to hypothalamic amenorrhea or delayed ovulation.",
                "Stress has no direct impact on GnRH but increases progesterone sensitivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress triggers CRH and cortisol, which have an inhibitory effect on GnRH neurons, disrupting the signaling required for follicular development and ovulation."

                "Dietary changes had no impact once the IVF cycle had already begun.",
                "The diet only worked if animal protein was completely removed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (such as Karayiannis et al., 2018) shows that high adherence to a Mediterranean diet significantly boosts IVF success rates, likely due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."

                "High urinary phthalate concentrations are associated with a 20% reduction in the number of oocytes retrieved during IVF.",
                "Phthalates only affect male fertility and sperm DNA fragmentation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environmental toxins like phthalates are proven to disrupt endocrine function; studies show they can reduce the yield of oocytes in stimulated cycles and increase the risk of implantation failure."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The maturation process for both eggs and sperm takes approximately 3-4 months, making this the 'critical window' for lifestyle and nutritional interventions to impact gamete quality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adjusting or prescribing medical grade pharmaceuticals (like Metformin) is strictly the domain of licensed medical providers; coaches must never alter a client's medication."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'unexplained' infertility. Your synthesis reveals high intestinal permeability (leaky gut) and low secretory IgA. Why might this be a priority for fertility?",
            "options": [
                "Gut inflammation can trigger a systemic immune response that may interfere with embryo implantation.",
                "Leaky gut causes the body to over-produce progesterone, leading to a short luteal phase.",

                "There is no connection between gut health and reproductive outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Estrobolome' and general gut health are vital; systemic inflammation from intestinal permeability can create an immune environment that is hostile to implantation and disrupts the HPG axis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for OHSS in PCOS patients; improving insulin sensitivity helps the ovaries respond more predictably to gonadotropins."
