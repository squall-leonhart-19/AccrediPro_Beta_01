            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "According to the ASRM updated definition discussed in Lesson 1, how many consecutive pregnancy losses are typically required to meet the clinical criteria for Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL)?",
            "options": [
                "Two or more clinical pregnancy losses",
                "Three or more clinical pregnancy losses",
                "Two biochemical and one clinical loss",
                "Four total losses regardless of timing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While historically three losses were required, the ASRM now defines RPL as two or more clinical pregnancy losses (documented by ultrasound or histopathology) to encourage earlier investigation."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A 41-year-old client presents with an AMH of 0.5 ng/mL and an Antral Follicle Count (AFC) of 4. Which concept is most critical to explain to her regarding 'egg quality' vs. 'egg quantity'?",
            "options": [
                "AMH is a direct measure of how many genetically normal eggs remain.",
                "Low quantity (DOR) does not automatically define the quality of the remaining eggs, but age (AMA) is the primary driver of aneuploidy.",
                "Her AFC suggests she is in premature menopause and cannot conceive with her own eggs.",
                "Supplements can increase the number of antral follicles available for the next cycle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DOR (quantity) and AMA (quality/age) are distinct. While low AMH indicates a smaller reserve, the age of the client is the most significant predictor of the chromosomal integrity (quality) of those remaining eggs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, 'Silent' Endometriosis is identified as a potential factor in unexplained infertility. What is a common 'red flag' for this condition in an asymptomatic client?",
            "options": [
                "Extremely high AMH levels",
                "Regular 28-day cycles with no spotting",
                "Repeated implantation failure (RIF) during IVF cycles with euploid embryos",
                "A history of heavy menstrual bleeding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Silent Endometriosis often lacks the classic symptom of pelvic pain but manifests as a 'silent inflammatory load' that prevents embryo implantation even when embryos are genetically normal (euploid)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Which PCOS phenotype is often referred to as 'Non-Obese' or 'Lean' PCOS, frequently involving higher adrenal androgen contributions?",
            "options": [
                "Phenotype A (Full PCOS)",
                "Phenotype B (Non-PCO PCOS)",
                "Phenotype C (Ovulatory PCOS)",
                "Phenotype D (Non-Hyperandrogenic PCOS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phenotype C (Ovulatory PCOS) involves hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries but maintains regular ovulation, often seen in lean individuals with metabolic complexities that are less obvious than Phenotype A."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A male partner has a 'normal' standard semen analysis, but the couple has experienced two early miscarriages. Which advanced test should a coach suggest they discuss with their urologist?",
            "options": [
                "Post-coital testing",
                "Sperm DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI)",
                "Total Motile Sperm Count (TMSC)",
                "Semen pH and volume assessment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard semen analysis looks at count, motility, and morphology, but not the integrity of the genetic material. High DNA fragmentation is a known cause of recurrent miscarriage and 'unexplained' infertility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Secondary Infertility Paradox' described in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "The inability to conceive after a previous easy pregnancy, leading to a unique form of 'disenfranchised grief.'",
                "The fact that secondary infertility is always caused by male factor issues.",
                "The medical phenomenon where a second pregnancy is easier to achieve than the first.",
                "The psychological state of wanting a child while being physically unable to care for one."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Secondary infertility is often met with less social support because the couple already has a child, leading to 'disenfranchised grief' where their pain is minimized by others."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "In the context of 'Silent Inflammatory Load' (Lesson 7), which ratio is often analyzed to assess the immune system's receptivity to an embryo?",
            "options": [
                "The Estrogen to Progesterone ratio",
                "The Th1 to Th2 cytokine ratio",
                "The LH to FSH ratio",
                "The Cortisol to DHEA ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healthy pregnancy requires a shift from a pro-inflammatory Th1 state to an anti-inflammatory, 'pro-gestational' Th2 state. An imbalance (Th1 dominance) can lead to implantation failure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "When a client is transitioning to a Donor Egg cycle, what is a primary psychological hurdle the coach should address?",
            "options": [
                "The fear that the child will not share the father's DNA",
                "The 'Grief of the Genetic Link' and the loss of the biological connection",
                "The concern that donor eggs are less successful than AMA eggs",
                "The financial cost of the supplements needed for a donor cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Grief of the Genetic Link' is a specific mourning process for the loss of the expected biological connection to their future child, which must be processed before moving forward with donor conception."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Adenomyosis differs from Endometriosis primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "It only affects the ovaries and fallopian tubes.",
                "It involves endometrial-like tissue growing within the muscular wall (myometrium) of the uterus.",
                "It is a purely hormonal condition with no physical lesions.",
                "It is resolved completely by a gluten-free diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adenomyosis is often called 'endometriosis of the uterus,' where the lining grows into the muscle wall, distorting the 'junctional zone' and making implantation difficult."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A client with 'Unexplained Infertility' has a high-stress job, poor sleep, and a diet high in ultra-processed foods. As a coach, how do you frame the 'Silent Inflammatory Load'?",
            "options": [
                "As a permanent state that requires immediate IVF.",
                "As a 'biological static' that may be interfering with the delicate signaling required for conception and implantation.",
                "As a condition that is only relevant if they have a diagnosed autoimmune disease.",
                "As the primary reason why their eggs are chromosomally abnormal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Framing inflammation as 'biological static' helps clients understand that while individual factors (stress, diet, sleep) might seem minor, their cumulative effect can disrupt the subtle hormonal and immune signaling needed for pregnancy."
