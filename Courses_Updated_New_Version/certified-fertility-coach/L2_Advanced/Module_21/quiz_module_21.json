            "question": "What is the primary biological rationale for the '90-Day Preconception Runway' emphasized in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "It takes 90 days for the liver to completely detoxify endocrine disruptors.",
                "It aligns with the full cycle of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis (egg and sperm maturation).",
                "It is the standard time required for thyroid medication to reach a steady state.",
                "It matches the average length of a standard insurance waiting period for ART."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 90-day runway is based on the biological timeline of germ cell development; oocytes take approximately 90-120 days to mature from the primordial stage, and spermatogenesis takes roughly 74-90 days."

            "question": "In the 'Functional Synthesis' model (Lesson 2), which of the following is considered a 'Tier 1' priority before addressing specific hormonal imbalances?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing DHEA for low ovarian reserve.",
                "High-dose progesterone supplementation.",
                "Glycemic regulation and gut-immune barrier integrity.",
                "Scheduling an immediate HSG (Hysterosalpingogram)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional Synthesis prioritizes foundational health (glycemic control, gut health, and inflammation) as Tier 1 because these factors dictate the cellular environment in which hormones operate."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, why is the supplement Vitex (Chasteberry) generally contraindicated during an active IVF 'stimulation' phase?",
            "options": [
                "It may interfere with pituitary suppression or the precise action of exogenous gonadotropins.",
                "It causes the uterine lining to thin significantly.",
                "It increases the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS).",
                "It deactivates the antioxidant properties of CoQ10."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitex acts on the pituitary gland to modulate LH and prolactin; during IVF, doctors use specific drugs to control these pathways, and Vitex can introduce unpredictable variables into the stimulation response."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client preparing for an IUI has a history of a 'thin lining' (6mm). Based on Lesson 4, which integrative intervention is most appropriate to include in the 30 days prior to the procedure?",

                "Complete caffeine cessation to prevent uterine contractions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L-Arginine and Vitamin E have clinical evidence for improving uterine blood flow and endometrial thickness, making them key components of ART preparation for lining support."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses Recurrent Implantation Failure (RIF). Which 'silent' factor is highlighted as a common cause that requires clinical advocacy?",
            "options": [
                "Poor sleep hygiene.",

                "Low dietary fiber intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic Endometritis is often asymptomatic but can significantly impair implantation; identifying it requires a specific biopsy (CD138 staining), which coaches should advocate for in RIF cases."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "When 'Data-Driven Pivoting' (Lesson 7), a coach notices a client's BBT chart shows a 'slow rise' and a 10-day luteal phase after 3 months of protocol. What is the most logical refinement?",
            "options": [
                "Transition the client immediately to donor eggs.",
                "Increase the dosage of melatonin to 10mg.",
                "Re-evaluate adrenal stress markers and consider pro-gestational support (herbal or clinical).",
                "Instruct the client to stop tracking BBT as it is causing stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A slow rise and short luteal phase often indicate suboptimal corpus luteum function or 'luteal phase deficiency,' requiring a pivot toward progesterone support or stress management."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Strategic Fertility Roadmap' discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a definitive guarantee of pregnancy within 6 months.",
                "To replace the medical doctor's treatment plan.",
                "To phase interventions logically so the body isn't overwhelmed and progress can be measured.",
                "To list every possible supplement the client could take."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic architecting involves phasing (e.g., Prep Phase, Action Phase, ART Support Phase) to ensure the body can assimilate changes and the coach can track which interventions are working."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Advanced Supplement Staging,' which antioxidant is specifically noted for its role in supporting mitochondrial ATP production in the oocyte?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "CoQ10 (Ubiquinol)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 is the gold standard for mitochondrial support in fertility coaching, as it is essential for the ATP production required for oocyte maturation and early embryo cleavage."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A client with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) has normal karyotyping and anatomy. According to Lesson 6, what is the next layer of the 'investigative stack'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If genetic and anatomical causes are ruled out, the roadmap must pivot to investigate 'unexplained' RPL through immunological testing (NK cells, cytokines) and thrombophilia screening."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Clinical Agency.' How is this demonstrated in the Finalized Empowered Action Roadmap?",
            "options": [
                "The client stops all medical treatments and tries only natural methods.",
                "The client follows the coach's plan even if it contradicts the doctor's safety warnings.",
                "The client is provided with specific questions and data points to discuss with their REI or OBGYN.",
                "The coach writes a formal prescription for the client to take to the pharmacy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical Agency means the client is empowered to be an active participant in their medical care, using the roadmap's data to facilitate collaborative conversations with their medical team."
