        {
            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "In Advanced Health History Mapping (L1), which term describes the underlying factors—such as genetics or early childhood environment—that set the stage for later fertility challenges?",
            "options": ["Mediators", "Triggers", "Antecedents", "Exposures"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Antecedents are the 'pre-existing' factors (genetics, birth trauma, etc.) that predispose an individual to certain health patterns before a trigger occurs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client's BBT chart shows a 'Fallback Rise' pattern where the temperature drops significantly on the second day after the initial shift before rising again. How should a coach interpret this?",
            "options": ["It is a sign of immediate progesterone failure", "It is a normal physiological variation caused by a secondary estrogen surge", "It indicates that ovulation did not actually occur", "It is a definitive sign of successful implantation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A fallback rise is considered a normal variation in about 10% of fertile cycles, often caused by a brief surge of estrogen shortly after ovulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When interpreting a hormonal panel (L3), a coach notices an LH to FSH ratio of 3:1 during the Day 3 testing. This ratio is a classic clinical marker for which condition?",
            "options": ["Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR)", "Hypothalamic Amenorrhea", "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)", "Endometriosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While not diagnostic on its own, an LH:FSH ratio where LH is significantly higher (2:1 or 3:1) is frequently seen in clients with PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which validated psychological screening tool (L4) is specifically designed to measure the impact of infertility across emotional, mind-body, relational, and social domains?",
            "options": ["PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire)", "FertiQoL (Fertility Quality of Life)", "PSS-10 (Perceived Stress Scale)", "GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FertiQoL is the gold-standard international tool for assessing the specific psychological burden and quality of life in fertility patients."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "In Metabolic Assessment (L5), a HOMA-IR score is calculated using fasting insulin and fasting glucose. Which score typically indicates the onset of early insulin resistance?",
            "options": ["Below 1.0", "Exactly 1.2", "Greater than 1.9", "Greater than 5.0"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 is generally considered the threshold for early insulin resistance, while scores above 2.9 indicate significant resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During a Lifestyle Toxicity Audit (L6), a coach finds a client uses heavy synthetic fragrances and plastic food containers. Which class of endocrine disruptors is the primary concern here?",
            "options": ["Organophosphates", "Phthalates", "Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)", "Heavy Metals"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are widely used as 'plasticizers' in containers and as 'fixatives' for fragrances; they are known to disrupt androgen and estrogen signaling."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "According to the WHO 6th Edition standards for Semen Analysis (L7), what is the minimum threshold for 'normal' sperm morphology using strict criteria?",
            "options": ["4%", "15%", "32%", "50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Under the WHO 6th edition (Kruger/Tygerberg strict criteria), a morphology score of 4% or higher is considered within the normal reference range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "What is the primary clinical purpose of a Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) compared to a Saline Infusion Sonogram (SIS)?",
            "options": ["HSG assesses egg quality, while SIS assesses sperm count", "HSG primarily checks fallopian tube patency, while SIS focuses on the uterine cavity", "HSG is used to measure AMH levels, while SIS measures FSH", "HSG is a blood test, while SIS is a surgical procedure"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HSG uses dye and X-ray to specifically check if fallopian tubes are open (patency), whereas SIS uses saline and ultrasound to look for abnormalities inside the uterus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "In the Comprehensive Fertility Audit (L8), data synthesis should follow a hierarchy. Which of the following should be addressed first as a 'foundational' layer?",
            "options": ["Advanced antioxidant supplementation", "IVF protocol adjustment", "Nervous system safety and circadian biology", "Surgical intervention for fibroids"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The audit synthesis emphasizes that foundational physiological safety—including nervous system regulation and circadian rhythms—must be addressed before moving to advanced interventions."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with a 9-day luteal phase, mid-luteal progesterone of 7 ng/mL, and 'spotting' for 3 days before her period. Which assessment synthesis is most accurate?",
            "options": ["The client likely has tubal factor infertility", "The data suggests Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD) and suboptimal corpus luteum function", "This is a classic presentation of high ovarian reserve", "The client is experiencing a normal, fertile cycle"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase under 10 days, progesterone under 10 ng/mL, and pre-menstrual spotting are hallmark signs of Luteal Phase Deficiency."
