            "question": "In a dual-pathology case of PCOS and Endometriosis, why is managing hyperinsulinemia considered a priority for reducing endometriosis symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin directly dissolves endometrial adhesions",
                "High insulin levels increase IGF-1, which can stimulate the growth of ectopic endometrial tissue",
                "Insulin lowers estrogen, which prevents the shedding of the lining",
                "Hyperinsulinemia prevents the liver from detoxifying progesterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperinsulinemia increases Bioavailable IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1), which has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of endometrial cells and exacerbate the inflammatory environment of endometriosis."

            "question": "A 42-year-old client with Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR) is preparing for IVF. Based on the lesson on Advanced Maternal Age, what is the recommended daily dosage of Ubiquinol to support oocyte mitochondrial ATP production?",
            "options": [
                "50 mg - 100 mg",
                "100 mg - 200 mg",
                "600 mg - 800 mg",
                "2,000 mg - 3,000 mg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies on AMA and oocyte quality typically utilize high-dose Ubiquinol (600-800mg) to overcome age-related mitochondrial decline and improve embryo cleavage rates."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "Sperm DNA Fragmentation (SDF) is a critical factor in male infertility. At what DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI) threshold do we see a significant statistical decline in natural conception and IUI success rates?",
            "options": [
                "Above 5%",
                "Above 15%",
                "Above 30%",
                "Above 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A DFI (DNA Fragmentation Index) of >30% is considered high and is associated with significantly lower pregnancy rates, longer time to conception, and increased risk of early miscarriage."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In cases of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) linked to immunological factors, a 'Th1 Dominance' is often observed. What does this signify in the context of the maternal-fetal interface?",
            "options": [
                "A healthy, anti-inflammatory state that protects the fetus",
                "A pro-inflammatory state that may lead to the rejection of the embryo",
                "A deficiency in Natural Killer (NK) cell activity",
                "An overproduction of progesterone by the corpus luteum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pregnancy is generally a Th2-dominant (anti-inflammatory) state. Th1 dominance is pro-inflammatory and involves cytokines that can be toxic to the embryo or interfere with proper trophoblast invasion."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When navigating a failed IVF cycle, the F.E.R.T.I.L.E. Method™ suggests a 90-day 'Priming Window' before the next attempt. What is the physiological rationale for this specific duration?",
            "options": [
                "It takes 90 days for the uterus to shed the effects of synthetic hormones",
                "It aligns with the full cycle of folliculogenesis (egg maturation) and spermatogenesis",
                "It is the time required for the liver to completely regenerate",
                "It is the standard insurance waiting period between cycles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 90-day window is critical because the recruitment and maturation of a primordial follicle into a dominant follicle (folliculogenesis) takes approximately 3 months, offering a window to influence egg quality via nutrition and lifestyle."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A client with 'Unexplained Infertility' has high exposure to phthalates through personal care products. How do these Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) typically impact fertility?",
            "options": [
                "They cause immediate tubal blockage",
                "They act as xenoestrogens, disrupting the HPO axis and potentially causing luteal phase defects",
                "They increase the pH of the vaginal canal, killing sperm",
                "They prevent the absorption of Vitamin D in the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and other EDCs act as xenoestrogens, binding to estrogen receptors and disrupting the delicate feedback loop of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis, often leading to ovulatory or implantation issues."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Secondary Infertility is often linked to 'Nutrient Depletion Gaps.' Which nutrient, often depleted during pregnancy and breastfeeding, is essential for the conversion of T4 to T3 and progesterone synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Selenium",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Folate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a key cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 to active T3. It also plays a vital role in antioxidant protection within the ovaries and supporting progesterone production."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Under the F.E.R.T.I.L.E. Method™, the 'R' in the acronym stands for 'Restoration of Gut and Micronutrients.' Why is gut health prioritized in a fertility case study?",
            "options": [
                "The gut is the primary site of estrogen excretion via the estrobolome",
                "Gut bacteria produce 90% of the body's progesterone",
                "A healthy gut prevents sperm from entering the bloodstream",
                "Gut health is only relevant if the client has IBS"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome is a collection of bacteria in the gut capable of metabolizing and excreting estrogens. Poor gut health can lead to the reabsorption of estrogen, contributing to estrogen dominance and hormonal imbalances."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "In a case study involving 'Silent Endometriosis' and RPL, what clinical marker might a coach suggest the client discuss with their doctor to investigate inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)",
                "Blood Glucose",
                "Hemoglobin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is a systemic marker of inflammation. While not specific to the uterus, chronically elevated hs-CRP in a fertility context can indicate an inflammatory environment that may hinder implantation or contribute to RPL."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "According to the module data, what percentage of 'Unexplained Infertility' cases are estimated to have an underlying environmental or lifestyle-based oxidative stress component?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Approximately 20%",
                "Up to 50-70%",
                "100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that a significant majority (up to 50-70%) of unexplained infertility cases involve sub-clinical oxidative stress, micronutrient deficiencies, or environmental toxic loads that are not caught by standard fertility testing."
