            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "When interpreting functional lab markers for optimal fertility, what is the 'functional' target range for Ferritin, as opposed to the standard laboratory 'normal' range which may start as low as 15 ng/mL?",
            "options": [
                "15–30 ng/mL",
                "30–50 ng/mL",
                "50–100 ng/mL",
                "150–200 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While standard labs often accept 15 ng/mL as normal, functional fertility standards suggest 50–100 ng/mL is required for optimal follicular development and oxygenation of the uterine environment."

        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Endocrine Modulation, a consistently low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) during the follicular phase is most indicative of which state?",
            "options": [
                "High vagal tone and parasympathetic dominance",
                "Chronic sympathetic nervous system arousal (high stress) inhibiting the HPO axis",
                "Optimal recovery and readiness for ovulation",
                "Excessive progesterone production in the previous cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low HRV indicates a lack of resilience in the autonomic nervous system and chronic sympathetic dominance, which can lead to HPO axis dysregulation and delayed or suppressed ovulation."

        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Which phenomenon in Complex Cycle Mapping is characterized by a premature rise in estrogen during the late luteal phase, leading to the recruitment of a follicle before the current cycle has ended?",
            "options": [
                "Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD)",
                "Luteal Out of Phase (LOOP) event",
                "Delayed Follicular Recruitment",
                "Estrogen Dominance Type II"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A LOOP event occurs when estrogen rises prematurely in the late luteal phase, often seen in perimenopause or high-stress cases, causing 'out of sync' follicular development."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Nutrigenomic research highlights the importance of the MTHFR 677C->T polymorphism. For a homozygous client (TT), which form of folate is essential to bypass the metabolic bottleneck?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Homozygous MTHFR mutations significantly reduce the ability to convert folic acid into the active form; 5-MTHF is the biologically active form that bypasses this genetic limitation."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "In mitochondrial bio-hacking, which 'nutrient duo' has shown a synergistic effect in improving ATP production and reducing spindle assembly defects in aging oocytes?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 supports the electron transport chain while PQQ promotes mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new mitochondria), making them a powerful combination for oocyte quality."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "A client undergoing IVF with a history of 'thin lining' (<7mm) may benefit from integrative advocacy. Which evidence-based adjunct might a coach suggest they discuss with their RE to improve uterine blood flow?",
            "options": [
                "Vaginal Sildenafil (Viagra)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vaginal Sildenafil has been used in clinical protocols to increase nitric oxide and improve uterine artery blood flow, helping to thicken the endometrial lining in resistant cases."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calcium D-Glucarate inhibits beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-packages' estrogen meant for excretion, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream."

        {
            "id": "q23_8",

            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "In Advanced Case Synthesis, if a client presents with high markers of systemic inflammation (hs-CRP >3.0 mg/L) and recurrent implantation failure, which 'silent' condition should be investigated?",
            "options": [
                "Silent Endometriosis",
                "Hypothyroidism",
                "Vitamin D Deficiency",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High systemic inflammation in the absence of other symptoms is a hallmark of 'silent' endometriosis, which can cause immune-mediated implantation failure even without pelvic pain."

        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "According to the principles of Integrative Advocacy in ART, what is the primary goal of the 'Pre-Retrieval Priming' phase (usually 90-120 days)?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the number of eggs retrieved regardless of quality",
                "To influence the follicular microenvironment during the recruitment and maturation phase",
                "To suppress the natural cycle completely using birth control",
                "To ensure the client loses at least 10% of their body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because oocyte maturation takes approximately 90-120 days, the priming phase is designed to optimize the environment in which the egg matures, directly impacting egg quality and chromosomal stability."
