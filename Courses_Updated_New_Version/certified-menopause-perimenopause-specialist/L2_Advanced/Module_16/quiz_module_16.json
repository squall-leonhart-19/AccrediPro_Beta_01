            "question": "In the context of Early Perimenopause and Metabolic Syndrome (L1), the 'P' and 'H' integration focuses on which two physiological drivers?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone and Histamine",
                "Pancreas (Insulin) and Hypothalamus (HPA/HPO Axis)",
                "Pituitary and Hepatic Clearance",
                "Parathyroid and Homocysteine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'P' and 'H' integration refers to the crosstalk between the Pancreas (metabolic health/insulin sensitivity) and the Hypothalamus (the master regulator of the endocrine system), which becomes dysregulated as estrogen fluctuates."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, why does surgical menopause require 'Rapid Stabilization' compared to natural menopause?",
            "options": [
                "Because the decline in hormones is gradual over 10 years",
                "Because the adrenal glands immediately compensate for ovarian loss",
                "Because the sudden 100% loss of ovarian estradiol and progesterone triggers more intense vasomotor and neurological symptoms",
                "Because surgical menopause does not affect bone density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Surgical menopause involves an abrupt cessation of hormone production, leading to a 'surgical shock' to the system that requires immediate and often higher-dose intervention than the gradual transition of natural menopause."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "For the High-Performance Athlete (L3), the 'Activate and Harmonize' strategy suggests which modification to protein intake?",
            "options": [
                "Decreasing protein to 0.8g/kg to protect the kidneys",
                "Increasing protein to 1.6-2.2g/kg to stimulate mTOR and counteract anabolic resistance",
                "Eliminating protein powders in favor of simple carbohydrates",
                "Protein intake is irrelevant for perimenopausal athletes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Perimenopausal athletes face anabolic resistance due to declining estrogen; higher protein thresholds (1.6-2.2g/kg) are required to trigger muscle protein synthesis via the mTOR pathway."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Stress-Dominant Transition), what is the primary reason progesterone depletion exacerbates HPA axis dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone increases cortisol production",
                "Progesterone metabolites (like allopregnanolone) are potent GABA-A receptor agonists that provide a 'calming' effect",
                "Progesterone blocks the action of the thyroid",
                "Progesterone is only active in the uterus and does not affect the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone converts to allopregnanolone, which modulates GABA receptors. When progesterone drops during perimenopause, the brain loses its natural 'brake' on the stress response."

            "id": "q16_5",

            "options": [
                "At least 20 years after the final menstrual period",
                "Only after the age of 75",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "Only if the client has existing heart disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that initiating HRT within the first 10 years of menopause (the 'window') provides significant neuro- and cardio-protective benefits that may not be present if started much later."

            "id": "q16_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the PHASE approach for POI, Assessment is critical because these women face decades of hormone deficiency, significantly increasing their risk for osteoporosis and early CVD."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Neurological Menopause (L7) often involves 'GABAergic shifts.' How does this typically manifest clinically during perimenopause?",
            "options": [
                "Improved focus and concentration",
                "Increased 2:00 AM waking and lower tolerance for alcohol/caffeine",
                "Deep, restorative sleep lasting 9 hours",
                "Increased verbal memory and recall"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As progesterone and its GABA-modulating metabolites decline, women often experience 'GABAergic shifts' characterized by fragmented sleep (3:00 AM wakefulness) and increased sensitivity to stimulants."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, why is there a 'complex interplay' between estrogen and histamine?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen increases the DAO enzyme, which clears histamine",
                "Estrogen stimulates mast cells to release histamine and downregulates the DAO enzyme",
                "Histamine has no relationship with female sex hormones",
                "Progesterone is the primary driver of histamine release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen and histamine exist in a positive feedback loop: estrogen triggers mast cell degranulation (releasing histamine) and inhibits the DAO enzyme responsible for breaking histamine down."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A 44-year-old client (Case Study) presents with new-onset hives, bloating, and worsening anxiety during her ovulatory phase. Which intervention matches the L8 protocol?",
            "options": [
                "High-histamine fermented foods to improve gut health",
                "A low-histamine diet paired with cycle-synced support to stabilize estrogen spikes",
                "Increasing estrogen dosage significantly",
                "Eliminating all fat from the diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For histamine-sensitive perimenopausal clients, stabilizing the estrogen spikes that trigger mast cell release and implementing a low-histamine diet is the standard clinical approach."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A client in the 'Stress-Dominant' transition (L4) has high evening cortisol and low progesterone. Which 'Coach Tip' is most applicable?",
            "options": [
                "Push through with high-intensity fasted cardio",
                "Prioritize 'NSDR' (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) and magnesium glycinate to support the HPA axis",
                "Restrict calories to 1,200 per day",
                "Increase caffeine intake to combat fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In stress-dominant cases, the goal is to lower the 'allostatic load.' NSDR and magnesium glycinate support the nervous system and GABA receptors, helping to stabilize the HPA axis."
