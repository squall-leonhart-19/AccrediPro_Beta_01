            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "In the P.H.A.S.E. Interconnectivity framework, which component specifically addresses the impact of endocrine disruptors (EDCs) and circadian rhythm disruption on hormonal signaling?",
            "options": ["Physiological", "Hormonal", "Affective", "Environmental"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Environmental' component of the P.H.A.S.E. framework focuses on external factors like EDCs, light exposure/circadian rhythms, and toxins that interfere with the endocrine system."

        {
            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "When interpreting advanced hormone metabolites, a low 2-OHE1 to 16α-OHE1 ratio (e.g., < 2.0) is clinically significant because it suggests:",
            "options": ["Excessive progesterone clearance", "A shift toward more proliferative, potentially more estrogenic pathways", "Optimal Phase 2 methylation of estrogens", "Low risk for estrogen-sensitive tissue changes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2-OHE1 metabolite is considered 'protective,' while 16α-OHE1 is more 'proliferative.' A low ratio indicates a higher proportion of 16α-OHE1, which is associated with increased estrogenic stimulation."

        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to the Neuro-Endocrine Axis synthesis, how does chronic HPA axis activation (elevated cortisol) directly impair the HPG axis during perimenopause?",
            "options": ["By increasing the sensitivity of LH receptors", "By suppressing the release of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) at the hypothalamus", "By accelerating the conversion of testosterone to estrogen", "By increasing SHBG levels, making more hormone available"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol elevation inhibits the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn reduces LH and FSH secretion, further destabilizing the HPG axis."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR of 2.8 and a Triglyceride/HDL ratio of 3.5. Based on Module 18's metabolic activation strategies, what is the primary clinical priority?",
            "options": ["Initiating high-dose estrogen therapy immediately", "Intense fasted HIIT training 5 days a week", "Restoring insulin sensitivity through nutrition and circadian timing", "Focusing exclusively on bone density supplements"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR > 1.9 and TG/HDL ratio > 3.0 indicate significant insulin resistance. Metabolic stabilization (insulin/glucose) must precede or accompany other interventions to ensure the client can safely handle HRT or intense exercise."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "The 'Glymphatic System,' which clears metabolic waste like beta-amyloid from the brain, is most active during which state, and which hormone supports its efficiency?",
            "options": ["REM sleep; Progesterone", "Deep N3 NREM sleep; Estrogen", "Light N1 sleep; Testosterone", "Active exercise; Cortisol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is most active during deep N3 NREM sleep. Estrogen is neuroprotective and supports the vascular and metabolic health required for efficient glymphatic clearance."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "For long-term cardiovascular protection in post-menopausal women, which biomarker is currently considered more predictive of risk than standard LDL-C?",
            "options": ["Total Cholesterol", "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)", "Fasting Glucose", "DHEA-S"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB measures the total number of atherogenic particles and is a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk in the post-menopausal transition than LDL-C alone."

        {
            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "In cases of 'Estrogen Dominance' paired with Histamine Intolerance, what is the underlying biochemical mechanism discussed in Lesson 7?",
            "options": ["Estrogen upregulates the DAO enzyme, clearing histamine too fast", "Estrogen downregulates the DAO enzyme and stimulates mast cell degranulation", "Progesterone increases histamine release from mast cells", "Histamine prevents estrogen from binding to its receptors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen can inhibit Diamine Oxidase (DAO), the enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine, while simultaneously stimulating mast cells to release more histamine, creating a vicious cycle."

        {
            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "The 'Mastery Protocol' suggests that in complex cases involving both HPA dysfunction and gut dysbiosis, the practitioner should first:",
            "options": ["Introduce heavy weightlifting", "Prescribe high-dose melatonin", "Address the 'Foundational Tier' (Sleep, Stress, and Gut integrity)", "Wait until menopause is fully reached before acting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Mastery Protocol emphasizes sequencing. Addressing the foundational tier (stress, sleep, gut) is required to reduce the total 'allostatic load' before introducing more aggressive metabolic or hormonal changes."

        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "What is the clinical significance of a low Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) level in a perimenopausal metabolic profile?",
            "options": ["It indicates excellent liver health", "It is a reliable surrogate marker for hyperinsulinemia and metabolic syndrome", "It suggests the client has too much progesterone", "It means the client is at low risk for cardiovascular disease"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin inhibits the hepatic production of SHBG. Therefore, low SHBG is often a clinical 'red flag' for insulin resistance and systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis for cardiovascular and neurological protection suggests that HRT is most effective when started:",
            "options": ["Only after age 65", "At least 15 years after the final menstrual period", "Within 10 years of the final menstrual period or before age 60", "Only if the client has high blood pressure"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the benefits for cardiovascular and brain health are maximized when estrogen therapy is initiated within the 'window' of 10 years from the onset of menopause."
