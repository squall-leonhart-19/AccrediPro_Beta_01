            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Prep' phase focuses on building a foundation of resilience, stabilizing the HPA-axis, and improving sleep/stress management before layering on more physiologically demanding interventions."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A client is struggling with severe night sweats and mood swings. According to Lesson 3, which botanical has the highest level of clinical evidence for managing vasomotor symptoms via SERM-like activity without stimulating the endometrium?",

                "Ginseng"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Black Cohosh is one of the most studied botanicals for menopause; it acts as a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) in the brain (hypothalamus) to reduce hot flashes without having systemic estrogenic effects on the uterus or breasts."

                "Steady-state walking for 150 minutes per week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To stimulate osteoblast activity and maintain bone mineral density post-menopause, high-intensity resistance training (heavy loads, 80-85% 1RM) is required to provide the necessary mechanical tension."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 5's discussion of 'Multi-System Symptom Clusters,' which physiological marker is most frequently linked to the 'Trifecta' of insomnia, visceral weight gain, and brain fog?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of sleep issues, abdominal fat, and cognitive changes is often driven by the synergistic effect of insulin resistance and chronic HPA-axis (cortisol) activation during the perimenopausal transition."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "If a client is a 'Non-Responder' to a well-formulated nutrition and exercise plan after 12 weeks, what is the first 'hidden layer' the specialist should investigate according to the Lesson 6 protocol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-responders often have underlying systemic inflammation or gut dysbiosis (estrobolome issues) that prevents hormonal balance and metabolic progress despite 'perfect' nutrition and training."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Evolve Roadmap' (Lesson 7), which biomarker is considered a critical 'Longevity North Star' for post-menopausal women due to the loss of cardioprotective estrogen?",

                "Serum Iron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB is a more accurate marker of cardiovascular risk than total cholesterol. As estrogen declines, LDL particle count often increases, making ApoB monitoring vital for post-menopausal longevity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To avoid 'protocol overwhelm' and accurately track what is working, specialists are encouraged to prioritize the 3 most impactful interventions before adding more complexity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) or post-menopausal bleeding is a 'red flag' that requires immediate medical referral to rule out endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy; this is outside the scope of a non-medical specialist."

                "Is the only way to lose 'menopause belly'",
                "Is more effective than strength training for bone density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zone 2 training (aerobic base) targets mitochondrial health. Since estrogen loss can impair mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility, Zone 2 is essential for maintaining the ability to oxidize fat."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Nutrition' (Lesson 3), what is the recommended protein distribution for a woman in the 'Sustain' phase to prevent sarcopenia?",

                "Protein is less important than total carbohydrate restriction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in menopause, protein must be distributed throughout the day, with at least 30-40g per meal to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) via the leucine threshold."
