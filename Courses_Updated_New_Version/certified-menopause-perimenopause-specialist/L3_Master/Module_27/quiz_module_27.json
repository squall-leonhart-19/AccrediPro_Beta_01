            "question": "In high-performance athletes, the decline of estrogen during perimenopause is most significantly linked to which physiological change regarding injury risk?",
            "options": [
                "Increased muscle fiber hypertrophy",
                "Decreased collagen synthesis and reduced ligament stiffness",
                "Enhanced neuromuscular coordination",
                "Decreased core body temperature during exertion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a crucial role in collagen synthesis. As levels decline, athletes face a higher risk of tendon and ligament injuries due to reduced structural integrity and changes in connective tissue stiffness."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Which autoimmune condition is most likely to experience a 'flare' or worsening of symptoms during the low-estrogen environment of menopause?",
            "options": [
                "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)",
                "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)",
                "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis",
                "Multiple Sclerosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While SLE often improves or stabilizes with lower estrogen, Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) frequently worsens during the menopausal transition, as estrogen has a complex, often protective anti-inflammatory effect on joint tissues."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "For a client with ADHD entering perimenopause, why might their stimulant medication suddenly seem less effective?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen acts as a catalyst for dopamine synthesis and receptor sensitivity",
                "Progesterone inhibits the absorption of ADHD medications",
                "Cortisol blocks the blood-brain barrier to stimulants",
                "The decline in testosterone reduces physical energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen modulates dopamine. When estrogen levels drop, dopamine signaling becomes less efficient, often exacerbating ADHD symptoms and making previously stable doses of stimulant medication feel inadequate."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "A breast cancer survivor experiencing severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) cannot use systemic HRT. According to current guidelines, which non-hormonal intervention has shown significant efficacy?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose Vitamin E supplementation",
                "St. John's Wort",
                "Low-dose SSRIs/SNRIs (e.g., Venlafaxine) or Fezolinetant",
                "Evening Primrose Oil"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low-dose SSRIs/SNRIs and the newer NK3 receptor antagonists like Fezolinetant are evidence-based, non-hormonal options for managing VMS in survivors of hormone-positive breast cancers."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "What is the primary clinical recommendation for a woman diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) at age 32 regarding HRT?",
            "options": [
                "HRT should only be used for a maximum of 5 years",
                "HRT should be avoided to prevent early breast cancer risk",
                "HRT should be maintained until at least the average age of natural menopause (51)",
                "HRT is only necessary if she is experiencing hot flashes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In POI, HRT is physiological replacement, not 'supplementation.' It is critical to maintain HRT until at least age 51 to protect bone density, cognitive health, and cardiovascular function."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Surgical menopause (bilateral oophorectomy) differs from natural menopause primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "It results in a gradual decline of hormones over 10 years",
                "Testosterone levels remain high while estrogen drops",
                "The drop in estrogen and androgens is immediate and total, often causing more severe symptoms",
                "It does not affect bone density as significantly as natural menopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Surgical menopause causes an overnight cessation of ovarian hormone production. Unlike natural menopause, where the ovaries still produce small amounts of androgens, surgical menopause leads to an abrupt 50% drop in testosterone and a total loss of estradiol."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "In clients with a history of PCOS, the transition to menopause often results in the 'Double Hit' phenomenon. What does this refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Simultaneous loss of bone and muscle mass",
                "The combination of pre-existing insulin resistance and menopause-induced visceral fat gain",
                "Experiencing both hot flashes and cold sweats",
                "The loss of both hair on the head and body hair"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PCOS patients already struggle with insulin resistance. The loss of estrogen during menopause further promotes visceral adiposity, creating a 'double hit' to metabolic health and increasing the risk of Type 2 Diabetes."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "According to the SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation), which demographic is likely to experience the longest duration of vasomotor symptoms (VMS)?",
            "options": [
                "Caucasian women",
                "Chinese women",
                "Japanese women",
                "Black women"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The SWAN study found that Black women report the longest duration of VMS (averaging 10 years) and are more likely to experience more frequent and severe symptoms compared to other ethnic groups."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "When working with a neurodivergent client (Autistic or ADHD), which 'sensory' aspect of menopause is often overlooked by practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "Changes in visual acuity",
                "Increased sensory processing sensitivity (tinnitus, light sensitivity, or tactile defensiveness)",
                "Loss of taste (ageusia)",
                "Improved olfactory sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent individuals often experience 'sensory overwhelm.' The hormonal fluctuations of menopause can exacerbate sensory processing issues, making environments (noise, lights, clothing textures) feel significantly more distressing."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "Which specific screening is essential for a woman diagnosed with POI to rule out associated genetic conditions?",
            "options": [
                "24-hour urine cortisol",
                "Karyotype and FMR1 premutation testing",
                "Gallbladder ultrasound",
                "Celiac disease antibody panel"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Karyotyping (to check for Turner Syndrome variants) and FMR1 testing (for Fragile X premutation) are standard of care in the workup of POI to identify underlying genetic causes."
