            "question": "When applying the PHASE framework (Physiological, Hormonal, Affective, Social, Environmental), which component addresses the 'Window of Opportunity' for cardiovascular intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Physiological",
                "Hormonal",
                "Social",
                "Environmental"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Hormonal' component of the PHASE framework specifically addresses the timing and administration of HRT, including the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis which suggests CV benefits are maximized when HRT is started within 10 years of menopause."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "In Advanced Hormonal Profiling, a client presenting with high estrone (E1) levels relative to estradiol (E2), coupled with elevated fasting insulin, most likely demonstrates which pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Adrenal-driven progesterone steal",
                "Primary ovarian failure",
                "Metabolic-estrogen recycling (Adipose aromatization)",
                "Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis suppression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated E1 relative to E2 in the presence of insulin resistance typically indicates peripheral aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue, a common metabolic-hormonal pattern in post-menopausal obesity."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Metabolic Harmonization, what is the clinical significance of a HOMA-IR score greater than 1.9 in a perimenopausal client?",
            "options": [
                "It is considered optimal for fat oxidation",
                "It indicates early-stage insulin resistance and increased risk for PCOS-like hormonal shifts",
                "It suggests the client is in a deep ketogenic state",
                "It confirms that the client has reached clinical menopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score above 1.9 is a key marker for early insulin resistance, which can exacerbate hormonal imbalances like androgen excess during the perimenopausal transition."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "Which strength training variable is MOST critical for stimulating osteoblastic activity and preventing sarcopenia in the post-menopausal evolution phase?",
            "options": [
                "High-repetition endurance training (20+ reps)",
                "Static stretching and flexibility work",
                "Mechanical loading at high intensity (>75% 1RM)",
                "Low-impact steady-state (LISS) cardio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-intensity mechanical loading (lifting weights at >75% of one-rep max) is required to provide the necessary osteogenic stimulus to maintain bone mineral density and counteract the rapid muscle loss (sarcopenia) associated with estrogen decline."

        {
            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "The 'Brain-Hormone Axis' lesson highlights that estrogen decline leads to a 'bioenergetic crisis' in the brain. What is the primary mechanism behind this?",
            "options": [
                "Increased blood flow to the prefrontal cortex",
                "A significant reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism",
                "Excessive production of serotonin",
                "Lowered cortisol production in the hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a key regulator of glucose metabolism in the brain. As levels drop, the brain's ability to utilize glucose efficiently decreases, leading to the 'brain fog' and cognitive fatigue often reported by menopausal clients."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "A client on HRT (Estradiol patch) continues to experience severe night sweats and low mood. You notice her diet is deficient in magnesium and B-vitamins. This represents a failure of:",
            "options": [
                "Pharmacological efficacy",

                "Social support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutraceutical Synergy involves ensuring the body has the necessary co-factors (like Magnesium and B-vitamins) to metabolize and utilize hormones effectively. Without these, HRT may be less effective at resolving symptoms."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "In the context of Cardiovascular Longevity, why does the risk of LDL particle size shifting from 'Pattern A' to 'Pattern B' increase post-menopause?",
            "options": [
                "Increased estrogen levels protect large particles",
                "The loss of estradiol leads to increased hepatic lipase activity and insulin resistance",
                "Decreased dietary fat intake",
                "Increased progesterone levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The loss of estradiol increases hepatic lipase activity and promotes insulin resistance, which shifts LDL particles toward the smaller, denser, and more atherogenic 'Pattern B' particles."

            "id": "q29_8",

                "Wait 3 months to see if the bleeding persists"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-menopausal bleeding is a 'red flag' that requires immediate medical referral to rule out endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy. It is outside the scope of a non-medical specialist to manage this symptom."

        {
            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical combination is specifically recommended in the 'Integrative Pharmacology' lesson to support bone density while on HRT?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C and Iron",
                "Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2, and Magnesium",
                "Melatonin and Valerian Root",
                "St. John's Wort and Black Cohosh"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 facilitates calcium absorption, Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) directs calcium to the bone matrix, and Magnesium is a critical structural component, making this the gold-standard synergy for bone health."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (52) has high stress, visceral weight gain, and 'wired but tired' insomnia. Her cortisol is high in the evening. Integration of the PHASE plan suggests prioritizing which intervention first?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) at 5 AM",
                "Aggressive caloric restriction (<1000 kcal)",

                "Increasing caffeine intake to combat daytime fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Sarah's case, adding more stress (HIIT or extreme dieting) would likely worsen her cortisol profile and metabolic state. Prioritizing neurological stabilization and circadian rhythm alignment is the foundational step for recovery."
