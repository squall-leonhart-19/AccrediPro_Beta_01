            "question": "To clinically confirm the post-menopausal baseline, a practitioner typically looks for 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. Which hormonal profile is most indicative of this stage?",
            "options": [
                "FSH < 10 IU/L and Estradiol > 100 pg/mL",
                "FSH > 40 IU/L and Estradiol < 30 pg/mL",
                "FSH between 15-25 IU/L and fluctuating Progesterone",
                "LH suppression with elevated Inhibin B"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the post-menopausal baseline, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) typically rises above 40 IU/L while Estradiol drops significantly (often below 30 pg/mL) due to the cessation of ovarian follicular activity."

            "question": "According to the 'Timing Hypothesis' discussed in Lesson 2, what is the critical window for initiating Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) to maximize cardiovascular benefits?",
            "options": [
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "At least 15 years after the final menstrual period",
                "Only after the age of 70 to prevent stroke",
                "Regardless of age, as long as LDL levels are below 100 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Timing Hypothesis suggests that HRT is most effective for cardiovascular protection when started within 10 years of menopause or before age 60, while the vascular endothelium is still relatively healthy."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'brain fog' and concerns about Alzheimer’s. If she is an APOE4 carrier, what specific lifestyle intervention is prioritized in Lesson 3 for cognitive longevity?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For APOE4 carriers, metabolic health (blood glucose and lipid management) and regular physical exercise are critical, as this genotype is more sensitive to the cognitive decline associated with insulin resistance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rapid bone loss occurs in the early post-menopausal years, with women potentially losing up to 20% of their bone density during this critical window due to the sharp decline in estrogen."

            "id": "q5_5",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Osteopenia is defined by a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5. A score of -2.5 or lower is classified as osteoporosis."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights 'Metabolic Evolution.' Why does post-menopausal insulin resistance often increase even if diet remains unchanged?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen loss reduces GLUT4 translocation and increases visceral fat storage",
                "Progesterone increases, causing sugar cravings",

                "Post-menopausal women require 50% more calories than perimenopausal women"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a key role in insulin sensitivity; its loss leads to reduced GLUT4 (glucose transporter) efficiency and a shift toward android (visceral) fat distribution, which promotes insulin resistance."

            "id": "q5_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Evolve' stage focuses on the psychological shift of menopause as a transition into a new life phase, requiring a redefinition of self-identity and finding a new, sustainable baseline for health."

                "HDL is only found in men"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that post-menopause, the quality of HDL can change; high levels of HDL-C may hide the fact that the particles have become dysfunctional and no longer effectively clear cholesterol from the arteries."
