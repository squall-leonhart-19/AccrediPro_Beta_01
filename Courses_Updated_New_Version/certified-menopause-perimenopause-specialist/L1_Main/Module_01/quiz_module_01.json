            "question": "In the PHASE Framework™, what is the primary objective of the 'Profile' pillar?",
            "options": [
                "To prescribe specific hormone replacement dosages immediately",
                "To establish a comprehensive physiological and symptomatic baseline for personalized care",
                "To eliminate all 34 symptoms within the first 30 days of coaching",
                "To focus exclusively on weight loss and caloric restriction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Profile pillar is the 'Discovery' phase where the practitioner gathers data on hormones, symptoms, and metabolic health to create a baseline for the rest of the framework."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Which hormonal change is typically the earliest marker of the perimenopausal transition, occurring even before significant FSH elevations?",
            "options": [
                "A sharp increase in Progesterone",
                "A decrease in Inhibin B",
                "A total depletion of Testosterone",
                "A consistent rise in Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As the ovarian reserve declines, Inhibin B levels drop. Since Inhibin B normally provides negative feedback to the pituitary, its decline allows FSH to begin rising."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to the STRAW+10 criteria, what specific menstrual pattern defines the transition from Stage -2 (Early) to Stage -1 (Late)?",
            "options": [
                "Cycles becoming shorter than 21 days for three consecutive months",
                "The occurrence of a single skipped period",
                "The presence of 'persistent' amenorrhea of 60 days or more",
                "Exactly 12 months of total amenorrhea"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stage -1 (Late Menopausal Transition) is characterized by increased cycle variability and the presence of intervals of amenorrhea lasting 60 days or longer."
        },

            "id": "q1_4",

            "options": [
                "Vasomotor symptoms",
                "Psychological symptoms",

                "Urogenital symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While less common than hot flashes, electric shocks and burning mouth are recognized somatic/neurological symptoms linked to fluctuating estrogen levels affecting the nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "When tracking menstrual cycles in early perimenopause (Stage -2), a 'persistent' change in cycle length is clinically defined as a difference of how many days between consecutive cycles?",
            "options": [
                "3 days",
                "7 days or more",
                "14 days or more",
                "Exactly 28 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The STRAW+10 criteria define the early transition (Stage -2) as a persistent difference of 7 days or more in the length of consecutive cycles."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which metabolic shift is most commonly observed during the 'Estrogen Gap' as a woman moves through the transition?",
            "options": [
                "Increased insulin sensitivity and lower LDL cholesterol",
                "A shift from gynoid (pear-shaped) to android (apple-shaped) fat distribution",
                "A decrease in visceral adipose tissue",
                "A spontaneous increase in basal metabolic rate (BMR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The decline in estrogen is strongly associated with a shift toward android fat distribution (visceral adiposity) and an increase in cardiovascular risk markers like LDL cholesterol."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "The 'Window of Vulnerability' theory in neuro-psychological profiling suggests that women are at the highest risk for new-onset depressive symptoms during which phase?",
            "options": [
                "Pre-menarche",
                "Early reproductive years (Stage -4)",
                "The perimenopausal transition (Stages -2 and -1)",
                "Late post-menopause (Stage +2)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The perimenopausal transition is considered a 'window of vulnerability' where rapid hormonal fluctuations can significantly impact neurotransmitter systems, increasing the risk for mood disorders."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In an intake strategy, why is it critical to identify 'Anovulatory Patterns' even if the client is still menstruating?",
            "options": [
                "Because anovulation results in a Progesterone deficiency, often leading to heavy bleeding and mood instability",
                "Because anovulation means the woman is officially in post-menopause",
                "Because anovulation guarantees the client cannot experience hot flashes",
                "Because anovulation always results in weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anovulatory cycles lack a corpus luteum, meaning progesterone is not produced. This 'estrogen dominance' (relative to progesterone) can cause heavy bleeding and increased anxiety or insomnia."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A 48-year-old client presents with a BMI of 29, a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.88, and rising fasting glucose. Which part of the Profile pillar should the practitioner prioritize?",
            "options": [
                "Bone Density Profiling",
                "Metabolic Health and Cardiovascular Risk Profiling",
                "Vocal Cord Change Analysis",
                "Hair Loss Mapping"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and glucose levels, mapping her metabolic health is the priority to mitigate cardiovascular and Type 2 Diabetes risks during the transition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of synthesizing 'Subjective Symptom Data' with 'Objective Clinical Staging' (like STRAW+10) in the PHASE Roadmap?",
            "options": [
                "To prove the client is overreacting to their symptoms",
                "To determine if the client needs surgery",
                "To validate the client's experience while identifying their specific physiological location in the transition",
                "To replace the need for any blood testing or medical consultation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis allows the practitioner to match the client's lived experience (symptoms) with their physiological stage, ensuring the intervention roadmap is both empathetic and clinically sound."
