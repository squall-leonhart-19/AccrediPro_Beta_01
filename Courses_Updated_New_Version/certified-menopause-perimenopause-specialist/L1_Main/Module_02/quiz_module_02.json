            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Harmonize' module, what is the primary physiological reason that insulin sensitivity often declines during the perimenopausal transition?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in total caloric expenditure due to aging",
                "The loss of the protective effects of estradiol on skeletal muscle glucose uptake",
                "An increase in progesterone which naturally causes insulin resistance",
                "A sudden decrease in the production of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estradiol plays a critical role in maintaining insulin sensitivity by promoting glucose uptake in skeletal muscle; as estradiol fluctuates and declines, women become more susceptible to insulin resistance even without dietary changes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the most sensitive indicator of early-stage insulin resistance in perimenopausal women, often appearing abnormal before fasting glucose rises?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c)",
                "Fasting Blood Glucose",
                "HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)",
                "Total Cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR calculates the relationship between fasting insulin and fasting glucose, identifying 'hyperinsulinemia'—where the body is overproducing insulin to keep glucose stable—long before fasting glucose or HbA1c reach pre-diabetic levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or HPA Axis Shunt) describes a process where the body prioritizes which hormone production pathway during periods of chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "Prioritizing DHEA over Cortisol",
                "Prioritizing Progesterone over Cortisol",
                "Prioritizing Cortisol over Progesterone and DHEA",
                "Prioritizing Estradiol over Testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the precursor hormone pregnenolone is diverted toward the production of cortisol to meet the demands of the HPA axis, often leading to a depletion of progesterone and DHEA."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "To prevent sarcopenia and support the 'anabolic resistance' common in menopause, what is the evidence-based protein recommendation for perimenopausal women?",
            "options": [
                "0.6 - 0.8g per kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 1.6g per kg of body weight",
                "2.5 - 3.0g per kg of body weight",
                "Exactly 40g per day regardless of weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that aging and declining estrogen levels increase protein requirements; 1.2 to 1.6g/kg is required to maintain muscle mass and support metabolic health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which enzyme, produced by certain bacteria in the estrobolome, is responsible for 'deconjugating' estrogen in the gut, leading to its reabsorption into circulation?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Amylase",
                "Lipoprotein Lipase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid (the 'package' the liver put it in), allowing the 'free' estrogen to re-enter the bloodstream, potentially contributing to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In Phase II Liver Detoxification, which specific pathway is crucial for neutralizing the potentially DNA-damaging 4-OH estrogen metabolites?",
            "options": [
                "Sulfation",
                "Methylation (via the COMT enzyme)",
                "Acetylation",
                "Glucuronidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT enzyme (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) performs methylation, which converts reactive hydroxyestrogens (like 4-OH) into stable, water-soluble methoxyestrogens for excretion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Phthalates, a common class of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) found in synthetic fragrances, primarily disrupt hormonal balance by:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the production of Progesterone",
                "Acting as anti-androgens and interfering with thyroid hormone signaling",
                "Stimulating the production of Vitamin D",
                "Reducing the half-life of Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are known to interfere with androgen (testosterone) receptors and can suppress thyroid function, which compounds the metabolic challenges of perimenopause."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "According to the Harmonization Protocol, why is blood sugar stabilization often addressed before intensive gut or liver protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Because blood sugar has no impact on other hormones",
                "Because dysregulated insulin and glucose act as primary stressors on the HPA axis",
                "Because it is the only way to lose weight",
                "Because liver detoxification cannot happen if glucose is above 90 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blood sugar 'rollercoasters' trigger cortisol spikes and systemic inflammation, making it nearly impossible to balance the HPA axis or support the liver if the foundation of metabolic stability is missing."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in the module found that just one night of partial sleep deprivation (4 hours) can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "Over 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data shows that acute sleep deprivation significantly impairs insulin sensitivity (roughly 25-30%), highlighting why sleep is a non-negotiable pillar of the Harmonization Protocol."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Client Case: A 47-year-old female presents with bloating, high anxiety, and 'stubborn' belly fat. Her stool test shows elevated Beta-glucuronidase. Which dietary intervention specifically targets this enzyme's activity?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing intake of Calcium D-Glucarate rich foods (like cruciferous vegetables)",
                "Switching to a strictly low-fat diet",
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates",
                "Increasing intake of fermented dairy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Calcium D-Glucarate (found in cruciferous vegetables or as a supplement) inhibits beta-glucuronidase, preventing the reabsorption of estrogen and supporting healthy excretion through the gut."
