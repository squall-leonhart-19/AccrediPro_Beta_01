            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which physiological change primarily contributes to 'anabolic resistance' in menopausal women, making it harder to build muscle compared to their pre-menopausal years?",
            "options": [
                "Increased sensitivity to leucine in the diet",
                "The decline of estradiol, which normally stimulates satellite cell proliferation",
                "A decrease in resting cortisol levels",
                "Overactive mTOR signaling pathways"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estradiol plays a critical role in muscle repair and growth by stimulating satellite cells; its decline leads to anabolic resistance, requiring higher intensity and specific protein timing to achieve the same hypertrophic results."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to the research discussed in Lesson 2, what is the estimated rate of muscle mass loss (sarcopenia) per year for women immediately following the menopausal transition?",
            "options": [
                "0.2% per year",
                "0.5% to 1% per year",
                "Up to 2% per year",
                "Muscle mass remains stable if protein intake is high"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While muscle loss begins earlier, the rate accelerates significantly during the menopausal transition, with some studies showing losses of up to 2% per year without intervention."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "To trigger 'Osteogenic Loading' and improve bone mineral density at the femoral neck, research suggests the force applied must reach approximately what threshold?",
            "options": [
                "1.0 times body weight",
                "2.5 times body weight",
                "4.2 times body weight",
                "10.0 times body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Minimum Essential Strain' required to stimulate bone growth in the hip (femoral neck) is approximately 4.2 times body weight, which is why heavy lifting or high-impact plyometrics are necessary."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Why is 'Chronic Cardio' (long-duration, moderate-intensity steady state) often counterproductive for menopausal clients struggling with weight gain?",
            "options": [
                "It increases insulin sensitivity too rapidly",
                "It can chronically elevate cortisol levels, promoting visceral fat storage and muscle breakdown",
                "It burns too many calories, leading to extreme hypoglycemia",
                "It stimulates too much Type IIx muscle fiber growth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic cardio can lead to sustained high cortisol levels. In the absence of sufficient estrogen, this promotes the storage of abdominal (visceral) fat and the breakdown of lean muscle tissue."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A client experiences 'stress urinary incontinence' during heavy squats. What is the most appropriate immediate coaching cue to help manage her intra-abdominal pressure?",
            "options": [
                "'Hold your breath throughout the entire movement (Valsalva Maneuver)'",
                "'Inhale deeply at the bottom of the squat'",
                "'Exhale on the exertion (the ascent) to allow the pelvic floor to lift'",
                "'Push your belly out against your lifting belt as hard as possible'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exhaling on exertion helps manage intra-abdominal pressure by allowing the diaphragm and pelvic floor to rise together, reducing the downward pressure on the pelvic floor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "How does the decline in estrogen specifically affect joint health and the risk of 'menopause arthralgia'?",
            "options": [
                "It causes an overproduction of synovial fluid",
                "It leads to a decrease in collagen synthesis and reduced hydration of connective tissues",
                "It hardens the tendons, making them less likely to tear",
                "It increases the thickness of articular cartilage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen receptors are located in joints and tendons. Lower estrogen levels reduce collagen synthesis and the water-holding capacity of tissues, leading to stiffness and pain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Activate' roadmap, what is the recommended protein dosage for a menopausal woman following a strength session to overcome anabolic resistance?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams of any protein source",
                "20 grams of collagen peptides",
                "30-40 grams of high-quality protein with at least 2.5-3g of Leucine",
                "Protein intake is only necessary before the workout, not after"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To overcome anabolic resistance, midlife women require a higher bolus of protein (30-40g) and a specific threshold of the amino acid Leucine to 'trigger' muscle protein synthesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is preferred over steady-state cardio for menopausal women because it:",
            "options": [
                "Decreases the production of Growth Hormone",
                "Specifically targets GLUT4 translocation, improving insulin sensitivity without needing high estrogen",
                "Is easier on the joints than walking",
                "Does not require a warm-up"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIIT (and SIT) improves insulin sensitivity by increasing GLUT4 receptors in the muscle, which is vital as estrogen's role in glucose metabolism declines."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When programming for a client in late perimenopause with fluctuating energy levels, which approach aligns with the 'Activate' methodology?",
            "options": [
                "Force the client to complete the high-intensity plan regardless of symptoms",
                "Switch entirely to restorative yoga until post-menopause",
                "Implement 'Autoregulation,' adjusting intensity based on her daily recovery and RPE",
                "Increase the volume of training to 'push through' the fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autoregulation allows the coach to maintain the stimulus of the 'Activate' phase (strength/power) while respecting the client's fluctuating hormonal state and recovery capacity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Overtraining Trap' in midlife women?",
            "options": [
                "Training more than 30 minutes a day",
                "The point where training stress exceeds recovery capacity, leading to 'flatlining' results and systemic inflammation",
                "Only occurring in elite athletes, not general population clients",
                "A myth used to discourage women from lifting heavy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In midlife, the recovery window is longer. If a woman trains too frequently or with too much volume without adequate recovery, she enters the overtraining trap where cortisol remains high and progress stalls."
