            "question": "In the 'Menopause-Metabolic Intersection,' how does the decline in 17β-estradiol specifically contribute to insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of glucagon in the pancreas",
                "By impairing GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane in skeletal muscle",
                "By reducing the total number of insulin receptors on adipocytes",
                "By stimulating the overproduction of cortisol in the adrenal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a critical role in metabolic signaling; its decline directly impairs the translocation of GLUT4 (glucose transporter type 4) to the cell membrane, reducing glucose uptake efficiency in skeletal muscle."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to Advanced Cardiovascular Risk Profiling, why is ApoB considered a superior marker to LDL-C for menopausal women?",
            "options": [
                "ApoB measures the total weight of cholesterol within particles",
                "LDL-C levels typically decrease after menopause, masking risk",
                "ApoB represents the total number of atherogenic particles, including VLDL and IDL",
                "ApoB is less expensive to test and more widely available in standard panels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ApoB (Apolipoprotein B) provides a direct measure of the total number of atherogenic particles. In menopause, women often see a shift toward smaller, denser LDL particles which LDL-C (a measure of mass) may underestimate."

                "5.0 - 6.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance in the post-menopausal state, reaching a leucine threshold of approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams per meal is necessary to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Irisin is a myokine released during muscle contraction that facilitates the 'browning' of white fat into beige fat, which is more metabolically active and thermogenic."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A client experiencing a 'Metabolic Stall' despite a significant caloric deficit is likely suffering from 'Adaptive Thermogenesis.' What is the primary hormone driving this downregulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged deficits lead to metabolic adaptation where leptin drops (signaling hunger and low energy) and active thyroid hormone (T3) decreases to conserve energy, stalling weight loss."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the enzyme produced by specific gut bacteria that deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to WHO criteria, a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 indicates osteopenia (low bone mass), while -2.5 or lower indicates osteoporosis."

            "question": "A 52-year-old client presents with a 'Metabolic Stall.' Her NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) has dropped by 30% due to fatigue. Statistically, how much can NEAT vary between individuals daily?",

                "Up to 100 calories",
                "Up to 500 calories",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that NEAT can vary by up to 2,000 calories per day between individuals of similar size, making it a massive lever in overcoming metabolic plateaus."

                "Eliminating all dietary protein to reduce mTOR activation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is the ability to switch between burning fats and carbs. Strategic carb cycling (higher carbs on training days, lower on rest days) teaches the body to utilize glucose when needed while maintaining fat oxidation capacity."
