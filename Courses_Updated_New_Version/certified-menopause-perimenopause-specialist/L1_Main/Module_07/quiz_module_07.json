            "question": "According to the STRAW+10 staging system discussed in Lesson 1, which hormonal marker is most indicative of the transition into 'Late Perimenopause'?",
            "options": [
                "A sustained FSH level above 25 IU/L",
                "A decrease in Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) to undetectable levels",
                "A consistent rise in Inhibin B",
                "Progesterone levels remaining above 10 ng/mL during the luteal phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Late perimenopause is characterized by increased cycle variability and a sustained FSH level >25 IU/L, reflecting the declining ovarian reserve and loss of feedback loops."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Metabolic Harmonization), what is the primary mechanism by which estrogen (E2) deficiency promotes insulin resistance in skeletal muscle?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of glucagon from the pancreas",
                "It impairs the translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane",
                "It causes a rapid increase in Type IIb fast-twitch muscle fibers",
                "It blocks the absorption of glucose in the small intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a critical role in metabolic health by facilitating GLUT4 translocation; when E2 drops, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle decreases, leading to higher circulating insulin."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 describes the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt). How does this affect a perimenopausal woman's hormonal profile?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive cortisol production increases the conversion of DHEA to Estriol",
                "Chronic stress redirects hormonal precursors to produce cortisol at the expense of progesterone",
                "High cortisol levels stimulate the ovaries to produce more eggs",
                "The shunt causes an immediate drop in Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes cortisol production (survival) over progesterone (reproduction), which can worsen the estrogen-to-progesterone imbalance common in perimenopause."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in post-menopausal women (Lesson 4), what is the recommended minimum 'Leucine Threshold' per meal to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "1.5 - 2.0 grams",
                "3.0 - 4.0 grams",
                "8.0 - 10.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to declining estrogen and aging, women require a higher leucine threshold (roughly 3-4g per meal) to effectively trigger the mTOR pathway and stimulate muscle protein synthesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Thermostat Theory' explains that vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) occur because the 'thermoneutral zone' does what?",
            "options": [
                "It widens, allowing for greater temperature fluctuations",
                "It narrows, making the body hypersensitive to minor changes in core temperature",
                "It shifts upward, making the woman feel cold constantly",
                "It disappears entirely, leading to hypothermia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Menopause narrows the thermoneutral zone. Consequently, even a tiny increase in core body temperature can trigger a massive sympathetic nervous system response (sweating/vasodilation) to cool down."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 focuses on neuro-stabilization. Which metabolite of progesterone is responsible for its calming, sedative effect on the brain via GABA-A receptors?",
            "options": [
                "Androstenedione",
                "17-Hydroxyprogesterone",
                "Allopregnanolone",
                "Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a potent neurosteroid that modulates GABA-A receptors, promoting relaxation and better sleep architecture. Its decline during menopause contributes to anxiety and insomnia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, why does the risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) increase significantly after the menopause transition?",
            "options": [
                "The loss of estrogen leads to a decrease in Nitric Oxide (NO) production and arterial stiffening",
                "HDL levels typically double, causing 'Good Cholesterol' toxicity",
                "Blood pressure naturally drops too low, leading to heart failure",
                "Estrogen loss causes the blood to become too thin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is cardioprotective because it stimulates Nitric Oxide (NO) production, which keeps vessels dilated. Without it, women face increased arterial stiffness and a shift toward more atherogenic LDL particles."

        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses the 'Bioenergetic Crisis' in the menopausal brain. What primary shift in fuel source occurs during this time?",
            "options": [
                "The brain stops using glucose and begins using protein for 90% of its energy",
                "There is a decline in glucose metabolism, and the brain may struggle to bridge the energy gap",
                "The brain begins to synthesize its own estrogen from fatty acids",
                "Oxygen consumption in the brain increases by 400%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As estrogen drops, the brain's ability to metabolize glucose efficiently declines. This 'energy gap' is a leading theory behind menopausal brain fog and increased long-term risk for cognitive decline."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A 54-year-old client reports significant sarcopenia and weight gain in the midsection. Based on Lesson 4 and Lesson 2, what is the most effective exercise prescription?",
            "options": [
                "Daily 60-minute steady-state jogging (Zone 2)",
                "Restorative yoga twice a week with no other activity",
                "High-intensity resistance training (6-10 rep range) combined with adequate protein",
                "Low-weight, high-repetition (30+) toning exercises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heavy resistance training is required to provide the mechanical tension necessary to overcome anabolic resistance and improve insulin sensitivity in the post-menopausal population."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "If a client is experiencing '3 AM wakefulness' followed by racing thoughts, which evidence-based nutritional intervention from Lesson 6 would be most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing caffeine intake in the late afternoon to prevent 'crashing'",
                "A high-sugar snack right before bed to spike insulin",
                "Supplementing with Magnesium Glycinate and L-Theanine to support GABAergic pathways",
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium Glycinate and L-Theanine support the nervous system and GABA activity, helping to stabilize the sleep-wake cycle and reduce the 'tired but wired' feeling common in menopause."
