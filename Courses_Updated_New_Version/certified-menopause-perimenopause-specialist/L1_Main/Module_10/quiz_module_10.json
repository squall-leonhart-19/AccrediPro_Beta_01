        {
            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "In the PHASE Framework™, which pillar focuses on the initial data collection of hormonal biomarkers, lifestyle habits, and symptom tracking?",
            "options": ["Profiling", "Hormonal Harmonization", "Activation", "Stabilization"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Profiling is the first step of the PHASE Framework™, involving the comprehensive assessment of the client's current physiological and lifestyle state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Lesson 2 discusses 'Advanced Profiling.' Which hormonal pattern is most characteristic of the 'Hormonal Rollercoaster' seen in early perimenopause?",
            "options": ["Consistently low estrogen and high FSH", "Erratic estrogen spikes with fluctuating FSH and declining progesterone", "High testosterone and low insulin sensitivity", "Flatlined cortisol and elevated DHEA"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early perimenopause is defined by unpredictable estrogen surges and drops, often occurring alongside the first signs of progesterone decline."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to the Protein Leverage Hypothesis in Lesson 3, why do menopausal women often experience increased hunger?",
            "options": ["They are not consuming enough healthy fats", "The body drives hunger until a specific protein threshold is met to preserve lean mass", "Estrogen increases the speed of gastric emptying", "Progesterone depletion causes sugar cravings exclusively"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Protein Leverage Hypothesis suggests the body prioritizes protein intake; if protein needs aren't met, the body signals hunger to encourage more consumption, often leading to overeating fats and carbs."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In 'Activation Strategies' (Lesson 4), what is the primary reason for recommending 'Heavy Slow Resistance' (HSR) training for the aging athlete?",
            "options": ["To increase cardiovascular VO2 max", "To bypass the need for protein intake", "To stimulate osteoblast activity and mitigate sarcopenia through high mechanical tension", "To reduce cortisol levels through aerobic movement"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heavy resistance training provides the mechanical loading necessary to stimulate bone growth (osteoblasts) and maintain muscle tissue (preventing sarcopenia)."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 explains the 'Estrogen-Dopamine Link.' How does declining estrogen specifically contribute to 'Brain Fog'?",
            "options": ["Estrogen is a co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis", "Estrogen prevents dopamine from crossing the blood-brain barrier", "Estrogen decline causes a surplus of dopamine, leading to overstimulation", "Estrogen has no relationship with neurotransmitters"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen modulates dopamine synthesis and receptor density. When estrogen drops, dopamine production can falter, leading to issues with focus, motivation, and cognitive clarity."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Regarding the 'Evolve Roadmap' (Lesson 6), what does the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis suggest about Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)?",
            "options": ["HRT should only be started 20 years after the final period", "HRT is most effective for cardiovascular protection when initiated within 10 years of menopause onset", "HRT is only effective if started before age 40", "There is no specific window for HRT benefits"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Window of Opportunity' suggests that starting HRT early in the menopausal transition or within 10 years of the final period provides the greatest cardiovascular and neuroprotective benefits."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, which of the following actions falls OUTSIDE the scope of practice for a Menopause & Perimenopause Specialist?",
            "options": ["Providing nutritional education based on the Protein Leverage Hypothesis", "Suggesting lifestyle modifications to improve sleep hygiene", "Adjusting a client's prescribed progesterone dosage to better manage symptoms", "Explaining the physiological mechanisms of the Estrogen-Dopamine link"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adjusting prescribed medication dosages is a clinical act reserved for licensed medical providers. Specialists may educate, but never prescribe or alter medical treatments."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In the Case Mastery (Lesson 8), a client presents with high cortisol, night sweats, and insulin resistance. According to the PHASE Framework™, what should be the priority?",
            "options": ["High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) to lose weight quickly", "Stabilization of the HPA axis and sleep before introducing high-stress exercise", "Immediate implementation of a ketogenic diet", "Focusing exclusively on bone density supplements"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PHASE Framework™ prioritizes Stabilization when a client is in a high-stress/low-recovery state, as adding intense exercise (Activation) to a 'broken' metabolism can worsen symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "What is the recommended protein intake range discussed in Lesson 3 for a menopausal woman aiming to maintain metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": ["0.4 - 0.6g per kg of body weight", "0.8g per kg of body weight (RDA)", "1.2 - 1.6g per kg of body weight", "Over 3.0g per kg of body weight"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To combat anabolic resistance and support metabolic health, perimenopausal and menopausal women generally require higher protein intakes, typically between 1.2 and 1.6g/kg."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Lesson 6 emphasizes cardiovascular longevity. Which lipid marker is often a more accurate predictor of risk in menopausal women than LDL-C alone?",
            "options": ["Total Cholesterol", "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)", "Triglycerides", "HDL-C"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB measures the total number of atherogenic particles and is considered a more precise marker of cardiovascular risk than LDL cholesterol alone, especially during the hormonal transition."
