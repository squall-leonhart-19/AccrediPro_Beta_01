            "question": "According to the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis in cardiovascular health, when is Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) most effective at providing cardioprotection?",
            "options": [
                "When initiated within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "When initiated at least 15 years after the final menstrual period",
                "Only when used in women over the age of 75 with existing atherosclerosis",
                "Regardless of age, as long as the patient has high HDL levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Window of Opportunity' suggests that HRT is cardioprotective when started early (within 10 years of menopause or before age 60) before significant atherosclerotic plaque has formed and hardened."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Which neurological shift is primarily responsible for the 'brain fog' and cognitive fatigue often seen in the perimenopause-to-menopause transition?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in cerebral blood flow to the prefrontal cortex",

                "The sudden overproduction of myelin in the hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a significant drop (approx. 20-25%) in the brain's ability to metabolize glucose during menopause, creating a bioenergetic crisis that manifests as cognitive symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "What is the primary function of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase within the 'Estrobolome'?",
            "options": [
                "It synthesizes new progesterone from cholesterol in the gut",
                "It deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream",
                "It breaks down fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)",
                "It binds to estrogen to ensure it is excreted in the stool"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase produced by gut bacteria deconjugates estrogen (breaks the bond with glucuronic acid), allowing the active hormone to be reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis, why does menopause often trigger a flare in symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen decline leads to a shift toward a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 cytokine profile",
                "Estrogen decline causes an over-activation of Regulatory T-cells (Tregs)",
                "Progesterone increases, which directly attacks joint cartilage",
                "The gut microbiome becomes too diverse, confusing the immune system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen has an immunomodulatory effect; its decline shifts the immune system toward a pro-inflammatory state, increasing cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-6 which exacerbate autoimmune flares."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A client presents with recurrent UTIs and a vaginal pH of 6.2. Which physiological change associated with Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "An overgrowth of Lactobacillus species",
                "Increased production of glycogen in the vaginal epithelium",
                "Loss of estrogen leading to decreased glycogen and a subsequent rise in pH",
                "Excessive sebum production in the urogenital tract"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lower estrogen levels reduce vaginal glycogen; fewer Lactobacilli can then convert glycogen to lactic acid, causing the pH to rise (becoming more alkaline), which allows uropathogens to thrive."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in a post-menopausal woman with sarcopenic obesity, what is the recommended leucine-rich protein intake per meal?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams of protein per meal",
                "20 grams of protein per day, total",

                "Protein should be restricted to prevent kidney strain in all menopausal women"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance, post-menopausal women require higher per-meal protein boluses (30-40g) to trigger muscle protein synthesis (MPS) compared to younger individuals."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which class of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs), often found in plastics and receipts, is known as an 'obesogen' because it promotes adipogenesis via PPAR-gamma activation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA and phthalates are well-documented EDCs that can interfere with metabolic signaling and promote the formation of fat cells (adipogenesis) by activating PPAR-gamma."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Centenarian Vitality,' what does the term 'Compression of Morbidity' refer to?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compression of morbidity is the goal of longevity medicine: to stay healthy and functional for as long as possible, only experiencing decline in the very final months or years of life."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "How does the loss of estrogen impact the lipid profile beyond just raising total cholesterol?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the number of small, dense LDL particles which are more atherogenic",
                "It increases the size of HDL particles, making them more efficient at clearing plaque",
                "It causes a 50% decrease in circulating triglycerides",
                "It has no effect on lipid subfractions, only on weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Post-menopause, there is a shift toward a more atherogenic lipid profile, characterized by an increase in small, dense LDL particles that easily penetrate the arterial wall."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Which lifestyle intervention has shown the greatest efficacy in improving both metabolic health and cognitive reserve (BDNF levels) in post-menopausal women?",
            "options": [
                "Strict bed rest and caloric restriction",
