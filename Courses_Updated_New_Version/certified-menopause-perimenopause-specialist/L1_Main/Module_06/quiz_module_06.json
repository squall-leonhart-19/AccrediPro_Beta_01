            "question": "Which mechanism best explains why the decline in 17β-estradiol during the menopause transition leads to increased insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen decline reduces the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell membrane.",
                "Estrogen decline increases the production of glucagon in the pancreas.",
                "Low estrogen levels cause a direct destruction of insulin-producing beta cells.",
                "Estrogen decline prevents the absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a critical role in metabolic health by facilitating the translocation of GLUT4 transporters; without sufficient estrogen, glucose uptake into skeletal muscle becomes less efficient."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in a postmenopausal client, what is the recommended minimum amount of high-quality protein per meal to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "10–15 grams",
                "15–20 grams",
                "25–40 grams",
                "60–75 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance, menopausal women require a higher 'leucine threshold' (typically found in 25–40g of protein) to stimulate the mTOR pathway and initiate muscle repair."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Nutritional Architecture' lesson, which strategy is most effective for restoring metabolic flexibility in a client with high fasting insulin?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic ketogenic dieting for 12+ months",
                "Carbohydrate backloading or 'pacing' around the resistance training window",
                "A low-protein, high-fat diet to spare glucose",
                "Eliminating all fats to prioritize glucose oxidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is best supported by 'matching' carbohydrate intake to activity (activity-dependent fueling), ensuring glucose is utilized by muscles rather than stored as fat."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Strength Training Programming for the Hormonal Window,' why is lifting at high intensities (>80% 1RM) prioritized over high-repetition 'toning' circuits?",
            "options": [
                "High repetitions increase cortisol too much for menopausal women.",
                "Heavy lifting is the only way to burn calories effectively.",
                "Heavy loads provide the mechanical tension necessary to recruit Type II fast-twitch fibers, which decline rapidly post-menopause.",
                "Menopausal women cannot perform high-repetition exercises due to joint laxity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The menopause transition is characterized by a disproportionate loss of Type II muscle fibers; heavy resistance training is required to maintain these fibers and metabolic rate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Wolff's Law, as applied to bone density preservation in Lesson 5, suggests that bone matrix formation is stimulated by:",
            "options": [

                "Reducing protein intake to lower the acid load on bones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wolff's Law states that bone adapts to the loads under which it is placed. Impact or heavy resistance that exceeds a certain strain threshold is required to activate osteoblasts."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "How does the 'Cortisol-Insulin Axis' specifically contribute to the development of visceral 'menopause belly' fat?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated cortisol inhibits insulin, causing muscle wasting and fat gain.",
                "Cortisol increases gluconeogenesis, which triggers insulin secretion, while visceral fat cells have a higher density of glucocorticoid receptors.",
                "Cortisol prevents the digestion of fats, leading to localized storage in the abdomen.",
                "Insulin suppresses cortisol, leading to a thyroid slowdown."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visceral fat has a higher density of cortisol receptors; when cortisol is chronically high, it drives glucose production and subsequent insulin spikes, funneling fat storage to the midsection."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Which cardiovascular change is most commonly observed in the first 12 months following the Final Menstrual Period (FMP)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The loss of estrogen leads to a rapid shift in lipid profiles (increased LDL/Apo-B) and a reduction in nitric oxide production, which increases arterial stiffness."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "When applying the PHASE Framework™ to a client with severe vasomotor symptoms and high stress, which 'P' (Priority) should usually be addressed first?",
            "options": [
                "Performance-based strength gains",
                "Aggressive caloric restriction",

                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under the PHASE Framework™, if the client's 'bucket' is overflowing with stress and lack of sleep, physiological stabilization is the priority before adding the stress of intense exercise or dieting."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "What is the 'Leucine Threshold' concept discussed in Lesson 2 regarding sarcopenia?",

                "A measurement of leucine found only in plant-based proteins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The leucine threshold is the specific amount of this branched-chain amino acid required to activate the mTORC1 pathway; this threshold increases as women age/enter menopause."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "A 52-year-old client (postmenopausal) presents with a DEXA T-score of -1.8 (osteopenia). Based on Lesson 5, which intervention is most evidence-based for bone preservation?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies like the LIFTMOR trial demonstrate that high-intensity resistance and impact training are safe and effective for improving bone mineral density in those with low bone mass."
