            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain the efficacy of the PHASE Framework™ in a group setting, practitioners must stratify participants by their hormonal stage to ensure the 'Harmonize' and 'Activate' interventions remain relevant to their specific physiological needs."
