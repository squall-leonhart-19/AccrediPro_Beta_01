            "question": "A client presents her latest lab results showing high FSH and low Estradiol, asking you to confirm if she is in menopause and if she should increase her progesterone. What is the legally compliant response?",
            "options": [
                "Confirm the diagnosis based on standard clinical ranges and suggest a dosage increase.",
                "Tell her the labs look like menopause but she must ask her doctor about the dosage.",
                "State that you cannot interpret labs for diagnosis or suggest medication changes, and refer her to her prescribing physician.",
                "Explain that FSH over 30 IU/L always indicates menopause and provide a supplement alternative to progesterone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interpreting lab results for the purpose of diagnosis and recommending changes to prescription medication (like progesterone) are strictly medical acts. A non-medical specialist must refer these queries to a licensed physician to stay within their scope of practice."

            "question": "To minimize the risk of a client claiming an 'implied' doctor-patient relationship, which clause is most critical in your Informed Consent & Disclosure document?",
            "options": [
                "A guarantee of specific health outcomes within 90 days.",
                "A clear statement that the specialist is not a licensed medical provider and the services do not constitute medical advice.",
                "A list of all the specialist's academic certifications and degrees.",
                "A clause stating that the specialist can change the program terms at any time without notice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Non-Medical Disclosure' is the cornerstone of informed consent for health coaches and specialists. It explicitly defines the relationship and prevents the client from reasonably assuming they are receiving medical treatment."

            "question": "Under HIPAA regulations in the United States, which of the following actions is a violation when handling Protected Health Information (PHI)?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sharing identifiable health information (name, city, and symptoms) in a public or non-secure forum is a major HIPAA violation. PHI must remain confidential and be shared only through secure, authorized channels."

            "question": "You want to use a testimonial from a client who says your program 'cured her hot flashes and stopped her depression.' According to FTC Advertising Standards, how should this be handled?",

                "Post it as-is, as long as the client actually said it.",
                "Post it with a small 'Results not typical' disclaimer in the footer of your website.",
                "Avoid using 'cure' language and include a clear, conspicuous disclosure of the typical results a consumer can expect.",
                "Only post it if the client provides a signed affidavit and a photo."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FTC prohibits 'cure' claims for non-medical programs. If using a testimonial that describes an exceptional result, you must clearly disclose what the 'typical' result is, and you cannot claim to cure or treat a disease (like clinical depression)."

                "Occurrence-based only covers accidents that happen in a physical office.",
                "Claims-made covers any incident that ever happened, regardless of when the policy started.",
                "Occurrence-based requires a 'tail' coverage purchase when you cancel the policy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Claims-made policies cover claims only if the policy is in effect both when the incident occurred and when the claim is filed. Occurrence-based policies cover any incident that happened during the policy period, even if the claim is filed years later after the policy has ended."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GDPR has 'extraterritorial effect,' meaning it applies to any organization—regardless of where they are located—that processes the personal data of individuals residing in the EU or UK."

                "It may violate Anti-Kickback Statutes (AKS) and ethical standards regarding 'fee-splitting'.",
                "It is perfectly legal as long as the client is informed of the payment.",
                "It is only a violation if the specialist is a licensed medical doctor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paying or receiving 'kickbacks' for referrals is illegal in many jurisdictions under Anti-Kickback Statutes and is considered unethical by most professional certifying bodies, as it creates a conflict of interest."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Threats of self-harm require immediate action. Specialists must have a pre-defined crisis protocol that includes assessing the level of risk and referring the client to emergency professional help (e.g., 988 in the US or A&E in the UK)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires disclosures to be 'clear and conspicuous.' This means they should be placed where consumers will notice them—typically before the link or in close proximity to the claim—not hidden in fine print or on separate pages."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Many states have strict 'Nutrition Practice Acts' that limit who can provide individualized nutrition counseling. A specialist must ensure their services do not violate the specific professional licensing laws of the state where the *client* is located."
