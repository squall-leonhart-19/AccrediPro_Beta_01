            "options": [
                "It reduces the total number of competitors and allows for premium value-based pricing.",
                "It requires less specialized knowledge because the demographic is smaller.",
                "It eliminates the need for a P.H.A.S.E. Framework™ application.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Micro-niching allows a specialist to solve specific, high-stakes problems for a defined group, which reduces competition and justifies premium pricing based on specialized expertise."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing anchors the cost to the result (e.g., sleeping through the night, returning to work) rather than the time spent, which better reflects the specialist's expertise."
