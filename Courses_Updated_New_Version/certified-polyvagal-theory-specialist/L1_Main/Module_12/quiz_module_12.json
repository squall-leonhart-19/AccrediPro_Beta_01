            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the most recent evolutionary development, unique to mammals, and facilitates the Social Engagement System (SES)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Play' state is a hybrid state where the Sympathetic system provides energy for mobilization while the Ventral Vagal system 'brakes' the fear response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to the principle of phylogenetic reversal, one must usually move 'up' the ladder through mobilization (Sympathetic) before reaching the Social Engagement state (Ventral)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A narrow Window of Tolerance means the system transitions into Sympathetic or Dorsal states with very little provocation, often due to a history of trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High vagal tone is associated with high Heart Rate Variability (HRV), indicating the Ventral Vagus is effectively regulating the heart's pace."
