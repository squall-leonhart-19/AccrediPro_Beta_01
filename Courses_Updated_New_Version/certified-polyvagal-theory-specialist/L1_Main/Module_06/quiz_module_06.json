            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Neuroception (L3) is defined as the subconscious detection of safety and threat. Where in the brain does this process primarily occur?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The physiological sigh (double inhale followed by a long exhale) is a proven mechanism to reinflate alveoli and trigger the Vagal brake via the diaphragm's influence on the heart rate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The biological imperative refers to the fact that humans are hardwired to seek safe social connection as a primary means of autonomic regulation."

                "Cognitive functions are often offline or impaired when the brainstem detects threat",
                "Bottom-up processing is faster for learning new cognitive skills",
                "Top-down processing requires too much physical energy from the client",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "During high states of autonomic arousal, the prefrontal cortex (top-down) is functionally inhibited. We must first stabilize the nervous system (bottom-up) before cognitive work can be effective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Processing deep trauma or repressed memories requires specific clinical licensure (e.g., Psychologist, LCSW). Coaches focus on regulation, education, and current autonomic states."
