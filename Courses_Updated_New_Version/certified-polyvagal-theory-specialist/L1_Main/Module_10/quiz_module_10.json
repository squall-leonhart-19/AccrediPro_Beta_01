            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Neuroception is defined as the nervous system's ability to detect risk without conscious awareness. Where is this 'subconscious surveillance' primarily processed?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception occurs in the primitive subcortical structures of the brain, bypassing the analytical 'thinking' brain (prefrontal cortex) to ensure rapid survival responses."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'functional freeze,' where they appear productive but feel numb, cold, and disconnected. Which autonomic state combination does this likely represent?",

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which grounding intervention utilizes the 'Voo' sound to stimulate the vagus nerve via the laryngeal and pharyngeal branches?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Voo' sound creates a vibration in the chest and throat that physically stimulates the vagus nerve, helping to shift the system toward Ventral regulation."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In the context of the Social Engagement System (SES), which cranial nerves are involved in regulating facial expression, listening, and vocalization?",

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A client's 'Window of Tolerance' refers to the range of autonomic arousal where they can process information and remain integrated. How is this window effectively widened?",

                "Through 'pendulation'—safely touching the edges of activation and returning to Ventral",
                "By forcing the client into high-stress situations to build 'grit'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resilience is built through the rhythmic oscillation between states, expanding the system's capacity to handle stress without collapsing into shutdown or exploding into panic."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagal Brake is the myelinated Ventral Vagus's ability to rapidly modulate heart rate, allowing for calm engagement or quick mobilization without a full sympathetic 'dump.'"
