            "question": "According to Stephen Porges, what is the defining characteristic that distinguishes 'Neuroception' from 'Perception'?",
            "options": [
                "Neuroception occurs below the level of conscious awareness.",
                "Perception is handled exclusively by the brainstem.",
                "Neuroception requires cognitive appraisal of a situation.",
                "Perception is faster than neuroception in emergency situations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the nervous system's 'surveillance system' that detects safety or threat without requiring conscious, cognitive processing."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "What percentage of the fibers in the Vagus nerve are afferent (sensory), carrying information from the body to the brain?",
            "options": [
                "20%",
                "80%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Approximately 80% of vagal fibers are afferent, meaning the vast majority of 'communication' is the body telling the brain its state, rather than the brain commanding the body."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which brain region acts as the primary 'hub' for interoception, integrating bodily sensations into a cohesive sense of self?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",

                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex (Insula) is responsible for decoding interoceptive signals and is essential for the emotional experience of bodily states."

            "options": [
                "Bodily sensations serve as an automated alarm system that influences decision-making.",

                "The skin is the primary organ for detecting social safety.",
                "Muscle tension is the only reliable indicator of a sympathetic shift."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic markers are bodily feelings (like a 'gut feeling') that the brain uses to quickly evaluate options and make decisions before conscious thought occurs."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In the context of Environmental Neuroception, which of the following is most likely to trigger a 'False Positive' for threat in a client with a history of trauma?",
            "options": [
                "Bright, natural sunlight in a large room.",
                "The sound of a rhythmic, steady heartbeat.",
                "A room with only one exit where the client's back is to the door.",
                "The presence of soft, weighted blankets."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environmental triggers like lack of exit visibility often trigger a neuroception of 'trapped,' leading to a sympathetic mobilization or dorsal vagal collapse."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Relational Neuroception is facilitated by the Social Engagement System (SES). Which cranial nerves are primarily involved in this system?",
            "options": [
                "CN I, II, and III",
                "CN V, VII, IX, X, and XI",

                "CN XII only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SES involves the trigeminal (V), facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), and accessory (XI) nerves, which control facial expression, middle ear hearing, and vocal prosody."

                "A micro-moment of Ventral Vagal safety that signals the system is okay.",
                "The first sign of a sympathetic 'fight' response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glimmers are the opposite of triggers; they are small moments that cue the nervous system into a state of safety, connection, and Ventral Vagal regulation."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client who feels 'numb' and 'disconnected' in a safe, supportive therapy session is likely experiencing which type of faulty neuroception?",
            "options": [
                "A False Positive (detecting threat where safety exists).",
                "A False Negative (detecting safety where threat exists).",

                "Hyper-Interoceptive Sensitivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A False Positive occurs when the nervous system misreads safety cues as threats, triggering a defensive state (in this case, a dorsal vagal 'numbness') despite being in a safe environment."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",

            "options": [
                "To immediately change the autonomic state.",
                "To move from 'detection' to 'recognition' without judgment.",
                "To analyze the childhood origins of the trigger.",
                "To perform deep breathing exercises to lower the heart rate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Awareness stage is about bridging the gap between unconscious neuroception and conscious recognition, allowing the client to say, 'I notice I am in a sympathetic state.'"

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which vocal quality is most likely to cue a neuroception of safety (Ventral Vagal) in a client?",
            "options": [
                "High-pitched, rapid speech.",
                "Monotone, flat delivery.",
                "Melodic prosody with varied frequency.",
                "Low-frequency, growling tones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prosody, or the musicality of the voice, is a primary cue for the Social Engagement System. Melodic, varied tones signal safety, while monotone or low-frequency tones can signal boredom or threat."
