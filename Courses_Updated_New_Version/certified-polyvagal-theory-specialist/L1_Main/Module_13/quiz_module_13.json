            "question": "In the V.A.G.U.S. Framework™ introduced in Lesson 1, what does the 'A' represent in the clinical sequence?",
            "options": [
                "Activation Analysis",
                "Autonomic Awareness",
                "Amygdala Assessment",
                "Afferent Alignment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The V.A.G.U.S. Framework™ stands for Ventral Mapping, Autonomic Awareness, Grounding Interventions, Utilizing Co-regulation, and Systemic Resilience. Autonomic Awareness is the second stage, focusing on the client's ability to track their state in real-time."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "When conducting 'Ventral Mapping' (Lesson 2), what is the primary clinical objective of identifying a client's 'Glimmers'?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from traumatic memories",
                "To create a cognitive list of hobbies",
                "To identify micro-moments of ventral vagal activation and safety",
                "To suppress the sympathetic nervous system response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glimmers are micro-moments of ventral vagal activation. Mapping them helps the client recognize the physiological signatures of safety, which is essential for building the 'Cartography of Safety' and expanding the window of tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Neuroception, which statement best describes the 'Neuroception Skillset'?",
            "options": [
                "The conscious cognitive appraisal of environmental risks",
                "The reflexive, subcortical detection of safety, danger, and life threat",
                "A voluntary breathing technique used to lower heart rate",
                "The ability to read facial micro-expressions in others"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is an involuntary, subcortical process. Developing it as a 'skillset' involves bringing these internal 'surveillance' signals into conscious awareness (interoception) to better manage autonomic shifts."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client presents in a high-arousal Sympathetic state (Flight/Fight). Based on Lesson 4, which grounding intervention would be most effective for 'Vagal Toning'?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, shallow chest breathing",
                "Extended exhalations (e.g., 4-count inhale, 8-count exhale)",
                "Total physical stillness and sensory deprivation",
                "Focusing on a high-intensity cognitive puzzle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations stimulate the vagus nerve and engage the 'vagal brake,' which slows the heart rate and helps transition the body from a sympathetic state back toward a ventral vagal state."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the Social Engagement System (SES). Which cranial nerves are primarily involved in the 'Social Engagement Complex'?",
            "options": [
                "Cranial Nerves I, II, and III",
                "Cranial Nerves V, VII, IX, X, and XI",

                "Cranial Nerve XII only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Social Engagement System involves CN V (Trigeminal), VII (Facial), IX (Glossopharyngeal), X (Vagus), and XI (Accessory). These control facial expression, middle ear muscles, swallowing, and vocal prosody."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Systemic Resilience' is defined by the ability to move flexibly between states. What does a 'narrow' Window of Tolerance typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "High vagal tone and excellent co-regulation skills",
                "A state of permanent Ventral Vagal stabilization",
                "A nervous system that quickly shifts into Dorsal Shutdown or Sympathetic Arousal",
                "The absence of a functional Dorsal Vagal pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A narrow Window of Tolerance means the individual has limited capacity to process stress before their nervous system triggers a survival response (either hyper-arousal/Sympathetic or hypo-arousal/Dorsal)."

            "id": "q13_7",

                "The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ), developed by Stephen Porges, is a standard tool in Polyvagal-informed practice for assessing interoceptive awareness and autonomic reactivity."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Based on the 'Advanced Tracking' concepts in Lesson 8, research by Ed Tronick suggests that in healthy attachment dyads, 'Repair' occurs approximately what percentage of the time?",
            "options": [
                "100% of the time",
                "70% of the time",
                "30% of the time",
                "5% of the time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tronick's research shows that even in healthy, secure attachments, the dyad is 'out of sync' (ruptured) about 70% of the time. The key to resilience is the successful repair that occurs in the remaining 30%."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client becomes 'flat' and unresponsive during a session (Dorsal Vagal). According to Lesson 8's Rupture Repair protocol, what should the practitioner's first priority be?",
            "options": [
                "Challenge the client's cognitive distortions",
                "Increase the intensity of the physical exercise",
                "Offer co-regulation through soft prosody and 'Ventral' presence to signal safety",
                "End the session immediately to avoid further trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client enters a Dorsal Vagal state (shutdown), the practitioner must use their own Ventral Vagal state to offer co-regulation. Soft prosody and a calm presence signal safety to the client's neuroception, facilitating a return to the Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Vagal Toning' (Lesson 4), what physiological metric is considered a 'gold standard' for measuring the functional strength of the myelinated vagus?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Pressure",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) / Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)",
                "Cortisol levels in saliva",
                "Pupillary dilation speed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV, specifically Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), measures the heart rate's rhythmic fluctuation with breath. High RSA indicates a strong 'vagal brake,' which is the hallmark of a healthy, resilient ventral vagal system."
