            "question": "According to the neurobiology of group co-regulation (L1), what is the primary role of the Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) in a workshop setting?",
            "options": [
                "To trigger the 'fight-or-flight' response for increased motivation",
                "To suppress all emotional expression to maintain order",
                "To provide an 'autonomic anchor' that allows members to down-regulate through social cues",
                "To induce a state of dorsal shutdown for collective meditation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The VVC acts as the physiological foundation for the Social Engagement System, allowing participants to use facial expressions, prosody, and gestures to co-regulate and feel safe within the group."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "Which environmental factor is identified in Lesson 3 as a common trigger for 'Danger' neuroception in sensitive participants?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flickering fluorescent lights can be neurocepted as a biological threat or 'unstable' environment, potentially triggering sympathetic arousal or sensory overload."

                "To identify which group members are 'toxic' to the environment",
                "To create a visual representation of the group's shared resources, safety cues, and 'glimmers'",
                "To force every member into a state of high-energy sympathetic arousal",
                "To rank participants based on their vagal tone scores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collective Ventral Mapping helps the group identify shared 'glimmers' and resources, moving from an individual 'I' map to a shared 'We' map of safety."

            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "A 2022 study referenced in Lesson 5 found that synchronized group humming and vocal toning led to which physiological outcome?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synchronized vocalizations stimulate the laryngeal and pharyngeal branches of the vagus nerve, increasing HRV and fostering a sense of biological 'attunement' among participants."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "If a 'sympathetic spike' occurs in a group (e.g., a heated argument), what is the facilitator's first priority according to Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately eject the disruptive participants",
                "To ignore the conflict and continue with the planned curriculum",
                "To utilize self-regulation to remain a 'Ventral Anchor' for the room",
                "To shout over the participants to regain control"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The facilitator must first stabilize their own autonomic state (self-regulation) to provide the co-regulatory cues necessary to bring the group back into a Ventral state."

            "id": "q34_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Biological mirroring involves mirror neurons and neuroception, where we subconsciously pick up and often 'match' the autonomic state of others in our social proximity."

        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "From an ethical standpoint (L8), why is 'Informed Consent' particularly complex in experiential Polyvagal workshops?",
            "options": [
                "Because participants cannot predict how their nervous system will react to certain exercises",
                "Because it is illegal to run workshops without a medical degree",
                "Because all participants must sign a waiver promising not to get upset",
                "Because the facilitator is not allowed to explain the risks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Informed consent in this context requires explaining that autonomic shifts can be unpredictable and ensuring participants know they have the 'right of refusal' for any experiential exercise."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "Which seating arrangement is recommended in Lesson 3 to maximize 'Social Engagement' and minimize 'Predatory Neuroception'?",

                "Classroom style (rows facing the front)",
                "The 'Open Circle' (no tables, clear sightlines)",
                "Theater style (darkened room facing a stage)",
                "Individual cubicles facing the walls"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The open circle allows for eye contact and clear view of hands/body language, which are essential cues for the Social Engagement System to detect safety."

        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the 'Scope of Practice' boundary for a Polyvagal Coach leading a group program?",
            "options": [
                "They are allowed to diagnose PTSD if the group is small",
                "They may perform deep trauma processing if the participant gives verbal consent",
                "They should focus on 'Psychoeducation and Regulation' rather than 'Reprocessing and Therapy'",
                "There are no boundaries as long as the workshop is titled 'Educational'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must stay within the realm of education and regulation; deep trauma processing or clinical diagnosis is reserved for licensed mental health professionals."
