                "A client seeking to improve their social engagement system",
                "A client with a history of complex trauma experiencing active, unmanaged dissociative episodes",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active dissociative episodes and complex trauma require clinical licensure and specialized therapeutic intervention, exceeding the educational/coaching scope of practice."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety-informed marketing avoids triggering the client's sympathetic nervous system (threat response) and instead invites them into a state of ventral connection."

            "id": "q30_5",
            "question": "The 'Co-regulation Contract' discussed in Lesson 5 primarily focuses on which ethical obligation?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Co-regulation Contract is an ethical commitment where the practitioner prioritizes their own regulation to provide a safe 'anchor' for the client's nervous system."

            "id": "q30_6",
            "question": "Why is Heart Rate Variability (HRV) recommended in Lesson 7 as a key metric for outcome tracking?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only way to measure blood pressure accurately",
                "It provides a physiological proxy for 'vagal brake' efficiency and parasympathetic tone",
                "It determines if a client is lying about their emotional state",
                "It measures the strength of the sympathetic 'fight or flight' response only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV is a scientifically validated metric that reflects the influence of the vagus nerve on the heart, indicating the functional state of the parasympathetic system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ventral Buffer Zones allow practitioners to discharge sympathetic energy or emerge from dorsal states between clients, ensuring sustainable practice."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic resilience involves a multidisciplinary approach where various providers support the client's nervous system from different angles (somatic, nutritional, clinical)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency sounds are evolutionarily associated with predators and can trigger a sympathetic or dorsal response in sensitive clients."

            "question": "When packaging Polyvagal services, why is 'Value-Based Pricing' preferred over 'Hourly Billing'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to charge more for less work",
                "It focuses on the shift in the client's baseline autonomic state and overall quality of life",
                "It is required by most insurance companies",
                "It prevents clients from asking questions during the session"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing reflects the profound impact of autonomic regulation on every aspect of a client's life, rather than just the time spent in a chair."
