            "question": "A Certified Polyvagal Theory Specialist who is not a licensed mental health professional must avoid which of the following to stay within their legal scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Educating clients on the functions of the Vagus nerve",
                "Using biofeedback tools to track Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Diagnosing or treating clinical Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)",
                "Teaching ventral vagal stabilization techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unless the practitioner holds a separate state-issued clinical license, diagnosing or treating DSM-5 conditions like PTSD is outside the scope of a PVT Specialist and constitutes the unlicensed practice of medicine or psychology."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "In the context of somatic and autonomic work, what specific element must be included in the 'Informed Consent' process that differs from standard talk therapy?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner's hourly rate and billing cycle",
                "The potential for 'autonomic discharge' or unexpected emotional abreactions during somatic tracking",
                "A guarantee that the client will reach a state of Ventral Vagal dominance within six sessions",
                "A list of the practitioner's academic degrees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because PVT work involves the nervous system, informed consent must explicitly mention that physiological shifts (trembling, temperature changes, or emotional releases) may occur as the body processes autonomic state shifts."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "When storing 'Neuro-Data' (such as HRV logs, skin conductance maps, or pupil dilation records), which data security standard is most applicable for practitioners in the United States?",
            "options": [
                "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)",
                "HIPAA/HITECH compliance for Protected Health Information (PHI)",
                "The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)",
                "The Sarbanes-Oxley Act"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biometric data and autonomic logs used in a health or wellness context are considered Protected Health Information (PHI) and must be stored in HIPAA-compliant encrypted systems."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "A practitioner is working via telehealth and the client enters a severe 'Dorsal Vagal Shutdown' (dissociation). What is the primary legal/safety requirement for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately terminate the call to protect the practitioner's liability",
                "Ensure they have the client's current physical location and a local emergency contact on file",
                "Record the session to show the client's state to their doctor later",
                "Prescribe a sympathetic-nervous-system stimulant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Telehealth compliance requires having a 'Crisis Intervention Plan' that includes the client's physical address for each session and a local emergency contact in case of a medical or psychological crisis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_5",
            "question": "Regarding 'Ethical Co-regulation,' why is the power differential particularly sensitive in Polyvagal-informed work?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner is usually paid more than the client",
                "The client's nervous system may 'entrain' with the practitioner, creating a physiological dependency",
                "The practitioner has access to the client's financial records",
                "Somatic work always involves physical touch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biologically, a client in a state of high vulnerability may biologically 'lean' on the practitioner's Ventral Vagal state. This creates a risk of 'neuroceptive transference' where the client feels a physiological bond that can be misinterpreted as personal intimacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "In advertising PVT services, which of the following statements would most likely trigger an FTC (Federal Trade Commission) investigation for 'unsubstantiated claims'?",
            "options": [
                "'Our program helps you understand your body's stress response.'",
                "'Polyvagal Theory provides a framework for understanding the autonomic nervous system.'",
                "'This 10-minute vagus nerve exercise is a 100% permanent cure for clinical depression and anxiety.'",
                "'Learn to move from a state of fight-or-flight to a state of safety.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FTC prohibits making 'cure' claims or '100% success' claims for clinical conditions without rigorous, peer-reviewed clinical evidence. Using 'cure' in marketing for mental health conditions is a high-risk compliance violation."

        {
            "id": "q33_7",
            "question": "If a PVT Specialist suspects that a child or vulnerable adult is being abused based on autonomic cues and client disclosures, what is their legal obligation?",
            "options": [
                "They must wait for physical proof before taking action",
                "They are 'Mandatory Reporters' in most jurisdictions and must report 'reasonable suspicion' to the authorities",
                "They should keep it confidential to maintain the therapeutic alliance",
                "They should confront the abuser directly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Health and wellness professionals are generally classified as mandatory reporters. The legal threshold is 'reasonable suspicion,' not absolute proof, and reporting is a legal requirement that overrides confidentiality."

        {
            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "Professional Liability Insurance for a Somatic/PVT practitioner typically covers 'malpractice.' In this field, what is a common 'risk' that requires such coverage?",
            "options": [
                "A client tripping on a rug in the office (General Liability)",
                "A client claiming 'psychological injury' or 're-traumatization' due to a somatic intervention",
                "The practitioner's computer being stolen",
                "Copyright infringement on the practitioner's website"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional liability (malpractice) covers the specific services provided. In PVT work, the primary risk is a client claiming that a somatic or autonomic intervention caused them psychological distress or autonomic instability."

        {
            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "When practicing across state lines via telehealth, what is the primary compliance hurdle for a PVT practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Internet bandwidth requirements",
                "State-specific licensing laws and 'Practice Act' restrictions",
                "The time zone difference",
                "The cost of international calling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most states regulate health and wellness services based on where the *client* is located. Practicing across state lines often requires a license in the client's state or ensuring the service is defined as 'coaching' rather than 'therapy' under that state's specific laws."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Right to Withdraw' in the context of a PVT-informed somatic session?",
            "options": [
                "The client can only stop the session if the practitioner agrees",
                "The client has the right to stop any somatic exercise or touch immediately, for any reason, without penalty",
                "The client must give 24 hours notice to stop an exercise",
                "The practitioner can withdraw the client's right to speak during a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain a sense of 'Ventral Vagal Safety,' the client must have absolute agency. The 'Right to Withdraw' at any second is a cornerstone of trauma-informed legal and ethical compliance."
