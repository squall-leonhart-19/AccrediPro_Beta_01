            "question": "What is the primary distinction between a Polyvagal Practitioner and a Polyvagal Strategist (Consultant)?",
            "options": [
                "The Strategist focuses on individual clinical outcomes, while the Practitioner focuses on group dynamics.",
                "The Strategist moves from individual co-regulation to designing systems that foster collective neuroception of safety.",
                "The Strategist is required to have a medical degree, whereas the Practitioner does not.",
                "The Strategist only uses digital tools, while the Practitioner only uses manual techniques."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Polyvagal Strategist transitions from 1-on-1 clinical work to systemic intervention, designing environments and protocols that influence the 'collective neuroception' of entire organizations."

                "The spread of biological viruses through physical contact.",
                "The process where one individual's autonomic state (e.g., panic or calm) triggers similar states in others through neuroception.",
                "A digital marketing strategy for Polyvagal services.",
                "The mandatory adoption of breathing exercises in a corporate office."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social contagion refers to the rapid spread of autonomic states within a group; a dysregulated leader can trigger sympathetic arousal or dorsal shutdown across an entire team."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dorsal shutdown often results from a lack of safety and predictability. Transparency and clear communication act as cues of safety that help transition employees back toward the Social Engagement System."

                "To completely stop the heart rate during rest periods.",
                "To modulate sympathetic arousal, allowing for high mobilization without crossing into 'fight-or-flight' panic.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elite performers use the Vagal Brake to 'thinly' release sympathetic energy, allowing for intense mobilization while maintaining the social engagement needed for strategy and fine motor control."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Institutional burnout occurs when staff are constantly 'co-regulating' dysregulated populations without having the environmental or systemic support to recover their own Ventral Vagal state."

            "id": "q35_6",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bio-Sync (Biological Synchrony) is the physiological alignment observed between individuals—such as a mother and infant or therapist and client—which can now be tracked via high-fidelity wearables."

                "It is a technique for balancing the left and right hemispheres of the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Parallel Process highlights that the supervisor's ability to provide a Ventral Vagal anchor for the supervisee is what enables the supervisee to effectively regulate their own clients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue is viewed as a physiological state—specifically a Dorsal Vagal 'shutdown'—occurring when a practitioner's system can no longer sustain the 'cost of caring' and resonance with trauma."
