            "question": "A Polyvagal-informed coach is working with a client who begins to recall a repressed childhood trauma in vivid detail. According to 'Scope of Practice' guidelines, what is the most ethical course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the session using VVC stabilization techniques to process the memory.",
                "Immediately pause the narrative and refer the client to a licensed mental health professional for trauma processing.",
                "Encourage the client to enter a Dorsal state to numb the emotional pain.",
                "Ask the client to provide more details to determine if the trauma is 'significant enough' for a referral."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must recognize the limits of their scope; while coaches can stabilize the nervous system, processing deep trauma requires clinical licensure. Pausing and referring ensures the client's safety."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "In the context of autonomic interventions, why is 'dynamic consent' considered superior to a single signed form at the start of treatment?",
            "options": [
                "Because a client's neuroceptive state changes, and a state of 'Dorsal Vagal' collapse may render them unable to truly consent in the moment.",
                "Because it allows the practitioner to charge for additional administrative time.",
                "Because it is a legal requirement in all 50 states for non-clinical practitioners.",
                "Because it prevents the client from ever entering a sympathetic state during a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Autonomic states fluctuate. A client in a 'shutdown' or 'fawn' response may agree to things they don't actually want. Dynamic consent involves checking in as states shift."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "When considering the 'Ethics of Touch,' what is the primary neurobiological risk of using touch with a client who has a history of trauma?",
            "options": [
                "It may lead to an immediate and permanent state of Ventral Vagal stabilization.",
                "It can trigger a 'neuroception of danger,' causing an involuntary shift into a defensive state despite the client's verbal 'yes.'",
                "It significantly decreases the levels of oxytocin in the practitioner's system.",
                "It is always illegal for a Polyvagal Specialist to use touch under any circumstances."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is below conscious awareness. Even if a client says 'yes,' their nervous system may interpret touch as a threat, leading to a sympathetic or dorsal defensive shift."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "How does 'neuroceptive vulnerability' impact the power dynamic between a practitioner and a client?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the client more powerful than the practitioner because they control the 'vibe.'",
                "It creates an inherent imbalance where the client's system is primed to look to the practitioner for cues of safety or danger.",
                "It eliminates the need for professional boundaries as both systems become one.",
                "It only affects the practitioner, making them vulnerable to the client's state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroceptive vulnerability means the client's nervous system is highly sensitive to the practitioner’s cues, placing a significant ethical responsibility on the practitioner to remain regulated."

            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "A 2021 study on 'Systemic Neuroception' suggests that marginalized populations may experience a baseline of 'chronic sympathetic activation.' How does this influence ethical PVT practice?",
            "options": [
                "Practitioners should assume these clients cannot reach a Ventral Vagal state.",
                "Practitioners must recognize that 'safety' is not just internal, but influenced by systemic and cultural environmental factors.",
                "Practitioners should ignore cultural differences to treat every nervous system exactly the same.",
                "It suggests that only practitioners from the same background can provide effective co-regulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires cultural humility, acknowledging that systemic factors (racism, poverty) impact a client's neuroception of safety regardless of the practitioner's intent."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "During a session, a client suddenly stops speaking, stares blankly, and their heart rate (monitored via wearable) drops significantly. This 'Dorsal Drop' requires the practitioner to:",
            "options": [
                "Force the client to stand up and do jumping jacks to increase sympathetic arousal.",
                "Maintain a calm, regulated Ventral presence and use gentle, non-demanding cues to invite the client back.",
                "End the session immediately and call emergency services for a suspected stroke.",
                "Shout the client's name loudly to 'break' the dissociation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Managing high-arousal or low-arousal drops requires 'Duty of Care.' A regulated Ventral presence provides the necessary co-regulation to help the client safely transition out of collapse."

            "question": "What is a primary ethical concern regarding 'Digital Co-regulation' in telehealth sessions?",
            "options": [
                "The lack of physical proximity makes it impossible to achieve any Ventral Vagal connection.",
                "The 'latency' or lag in video calls can be neuroceptively interpreted as a 'lack of contingency,' triggering a threat response.",
                "Digital sessions are not HIPAA compliant regardless of the platform used.",
                "Clients are more likely to lie about their autonomic state when behind a screen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Small delays in audio/video (latency) can disrupt the 'Social Engagement System,' as the brain expects immediate contingent responses. Practitioners must ethically manage this 'digital gap.'"

        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Why is practitioner self-regulation considered an 'Ethical Imperative' rather than just 'self-care'?",
            "options": [
                "Because a dysregulated practitioner cannot provide the 'Ventral Vagal' anchor necessary for client safety and co-regulation.",
                "Because insurance companies require practitioners to prove they meditate.",
                "Because it allows the practitioner to work 60 hours a week without burnout.",
                "Because it is the only way to ensure the client never feels any sympathetic arousal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In PVT, the practitioner's nervous system is the primary intervention tool. If the practitioner is dysregulated, they may inadvertently transmit cues of danger to the client."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "In a case study involving a client with 'Fawn' tendencies, the practitioner notices the client constantly agrees with every suggestion. What is the ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Celebrate the client's high level of 'compliance' and move faster through the protocol.",
                "Slow down and explicitly explore if the client feels safe enough to disagree, acknowledging the Fawn response.",
                "Assume the client is in a permanent Ventral Vagal state because they are smiling.",
                "Tell the client they are being 'fake' and need to be more honest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fawning is a defensive 'appeasement' strategy. Ethically, the practitioner must recognize this as a lack of true safety and adjust the pace to ensure genuine consent."

            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Right to Withdraw' in a Polyvagal-informed session?",
            "options": [
                "The client can only leave if the practitioner determines they are regulated enough to drive.",
                "The client must provide 24 hours notice before ending a session based on autonomic discomfort.",
                "The client has the right to stop any autonomic exercise at any second, for any reason, without explanation.",
                "The right to withdraw only applies to research studies, not coaching sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maintain a neuroception of safety, the client must have absolute agency over their own nervous system, including the immediate right to stop any intervention."
