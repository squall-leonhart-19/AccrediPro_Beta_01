            "question": "When conducting an 'Autonomic Intake' (Lesson 1), what is the primary shift required of the practitioner compared to a traditional clinical intake?",
            "options": [
                "Prioritizing the chronological accuracy of the trauma history",
                "Moving from the cognitive narrative to the physiological state of the nervous system",
                "Focusing exclusively on the client's DSM-5 diagnostic criteria",
                "Ensuring the client remains in a state of high sympathetic arousal to access memories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Autonomic Intake prioritizes the 'how' of the body's response over the 'what' of the story, focusing on the state of the nervous system rather than just the cognitive narrative."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "The Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ), developed by Dr. Stephen Porges, specifically measures which of the following?",

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In clinical Heart Rate Variability (HRV) monitoring, what does Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) specifically represent?",
            "options": [
                "The degree of sympathetic nervous system dominance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSA is the rhythmic fluctuation in heart rate linked to breathing and serves as a direct proxy for the 'vagal brake' or the influence of the myelinated ventral vagus."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "When assessing the Social Engagement System (SES), a practitioner observes a client with 'flat prosody' and minimal facial expression. Which cranial nerves are likely showing reduced efferent influence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Social Engagement System involves the integrated regulation of CN VII (facial expression) and CN X (laryngeal/pharyngeal control for vocal prosody)."

            "id": "q20_6",

            "options": [
                "Play involves only the Dorsal Vagal system",
                "Aggression involves higher levels of oxytocin",
                "Play is a mixed state of Sympathetic arousal co-regulated by the Ventral Vagal system",
                "There is no autonomic difference; they are both pure Sympathetic states"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Play is a 'hybrid' or mixed state where Sympathetic mobilization is modulated by the Ventral Vagal system to maintain safety and connection."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client presents with high 'Neuroceptive Load' (Lesson 7). Which of the following environmental factors would most likely increase this load?",

                "Soft, prosodic vocal cues from the practitioner",
                "Predictable, rhythmic movements in the room",
                "A well-lit space with clear exits and warm colors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neuroceptive load is increased by cues of danger, such as low-frequency sounds (which mimic predators) and poor lighting, which can trigger the sympathetic or dorsal systems."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In 'Resilience Benchmarking' (Lesson 8), what is the most significant indicator of autonomic progress over a 6-month period?",
            "options": [
                "The total elimination of all sympathetic activation",
                "The speed of 'Vagal Rebound' (returning to Ventral Vagal state after a stressor)",
                "The client's ability to remain in Dorsal Vagal shutdown for longer periods",
                "Increasing the heart rate to maximum levels during every session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resilience is not the absence of stress, but the efficiency of the nervous system in returning to a state of safety (Ventral Vagal) after being challenged."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client's ANSI (Autonomic Nervous System Inventory) score shows a high correlation with 'Sub-diaphragmatic Reactivity.' What clinical symptoms would you expect to see?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid heart rate and sweaty palms",
                "Digestive distress, nausea, or 'gut' shutdown",
                "Increased verbal fluency and social desire",
                "Excessive eye contact and smiling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sub-diaphragmatic reactivity refers to the organs below the diaphragm, which are primarily innervated by the unmyelinated Dorsal Vagus, often manifesting as digestive issues."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "When using HRV as a longitudinal progress monitor, a consistent increase in the RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) value typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Worsening autonomic dysregulation",
                "Increased parasympathetic (vagal) activity and better regulatory capacity",
                "Chronic sympathetic over-arousal",
                "A decrease in the client's overall resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is a standard HRV metric that reflects short-term changes in heart rate, primarily mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system; higher values generally indicate better vagal tone."
