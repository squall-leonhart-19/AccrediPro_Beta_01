            "options": [
                "It may trigger a 'Sympathetic Storm' as the system passes through mobilization on its way back to safety",
                "It will make the client too dependent on the practitioner for happiness",
                "There is no danger; Ventral safety is always the immediate goal",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In complex trauma, the 'thaw' from a chronic Dorsal state often releases stored Sympathetic energy (the 'Sympathetic Storm'), which can be overwhelming if not paced correctly."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crisis management requires physiological stabilization. Long exhalations stimulate the vagus nerve to slow the heart, and co-regulatory cues provide the neuroception of safety."
