            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the V.A.G.U.S. Framework™, 'A' stands for Autonomic Awareness, focusing on the practitioner's ability to maintain a regulated Ventral Vagal state to serve as a biological mirror for the client."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For complex dissociation, the 'G' (Grounding) in V.A.G.U.S. requires somatic titration and gentle cues to slowly bring the client back from Dorsal Vagal shutdown without triggering a Sympathetic spike."

            ],

                "The HPA axis only activates during Ventral Vagal states.",
                "The Vagus nerve inhibits the HPA axis entirely during a 'fight or flight' response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SNS is the fast-acting neural response, while the HPA axis is the slower, hormonal system that sustains the stress response if the threat persists."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional mastery involves the fluid ability to use one's own autonomic state (mirroring) while strategically guiding the client's state based on real-time neuroceptive feedback."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Level 3 emphasizes that the practitioner's own Ventral Vagal tone is a primary driver of the client's ability to feel safe and stabilize their own nervous system."
