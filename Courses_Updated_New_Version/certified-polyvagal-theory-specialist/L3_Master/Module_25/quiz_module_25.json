            "question": "In Polyvagal-informed supervision, what is the primary objective of the 'Neuroceptive Check-in' at the start of a session?",
            "options": [
                "To review the supervisee's clinical notes for accuracy",
                "To establish a foundation of Ventral Vagal safety and assess the supervisee's current physiological state",
                "To ensure the supervisee has met their hourly requirements for certification",
                "To provide immediate corrective feedback on the supervisee's previous session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neuroceptive Check-in is designed to bring awareness to the supervisee's autonomic state, ensuring they are in a Ventral Vagal state (Safety) to facilitate learning and co-regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "Which concept describes the phenomenon where a supervisee subconsciously mirrors the autonomic dysregulation of their client, which is then reflected in the supervisory relationship?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Resonance",
                "The Vagal Brake Failure",
                "The Parallel Process of Neuroception",
                "Dorsal Disconnection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Parallel Process of Neuroception occurs when the physiological state of the client is 'carried' by the practitioner into the supervision, allowing the supervisor to observe and help regulate the state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "Within the V.A.G.U.S. Framework™, what does the 'G' represent in the context of mentoring?",

                "Global Assessment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generative Feedback in the V.A.G.U.S. Framework™ focuses on feedback that stimulates growth and neuroplasticity through a lens of safety rather than criticism."

        {
            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A supervisee reports feeling 'heavy, foggy, and emotionally distant' after working with a survivor of chronic neglect. Which state of vicarious dysregulation are they likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Hyper-arousal",
                "Ventral Vagal Fluency",
                "Dorsal Vagal Hypo-arousal",
                "Mixed State Play"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Feeling heavy, foggy, and distant are hallmark indicators of the Dorsal Vagal state, often associated with vicarious trauma or secondary traumatic stress."

        {
            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, how should a supervisor ethically manage the 'Biological Hierarchy' inherent in the supervisory relationship?",
            "options": [
                "By maintaining a strict professional distance to avoid 'Vagal Enmeshment'",
                "By asserting dominance to ensure the supervisee follows protocols",
                "By intentionally using prosody, eye contact, and transparency to signal 'Ventral-to-Ventral' safety",
                "By ignoring power dynamics to focus solely on clinical data"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because hierarchy can trigger a 'threat' response (Sympathetic/Dorsal), the supervisor must use Social Engagement System cues to create a safe container for learning."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "In Group Supervision (Lesson 6), what is the primary benefit of 'Collective Co-regulation'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the supervisor to work with more people at once to save time",
                "It creates a 'Neural Safety Net' that amplifies the Ventral Vagal signal for all participants",
                "It encourages competition between practitioners to improve performance",
                "It prevents the need for individual self-regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collective co-regulation utilizes the Social Engagement Systems of the entire group to stabilize dysregulated members and reinforce the 'Safety' circuit."

            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "When assessing a practitioner's competency in 'Vagal Toning' (Lesson 7), which metric is most indicative of skill?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner's ability to remain in a Ventral state regardless of the client's state",
                "The practitioner's ability to force a client into a Ventral state within 10 minutes",
                "The practitioner's 'Autonomic Agility'—the speed and smoothness of returning to Ventral after a challenge",
                "The total number of breathing exercises the practitioner has memorized"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autonomic Agility (or Vagal Flexibility) is the gold standard of competency, showing the practitioner can navigate states without getting 'stuck' in dysregulation."

            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module found that practitioners who engaged in monthly Polyvagal-informed supervision showed a ____ reduction in markers of Secondary Traumatic Stress.",

                "15%",
                "32%",
                "50%",
                "85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that consistent, state-aware supervision correlates with a roughly 32% reduction in vicarious trauma symptoms compared to traditional supervision."

        {
            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key component of 'Biological Boundaries' in a sustainable mentorship practice?",
            "options": [
                "Refusing to work with clients who have high trauma loads",
                "Practicing 'Somatic Shaking' or 'Vagal Sighing' immediately after a supervision session to discharge energy",
                "Working 60 hours a week to build 'Vagal Resilience'",
                "Suppressing all emotions during sessions to remain objective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological boundaries involve active physiological discharge (shaking, sighing, movement) to prevent the accumulation of sympathetic or dorsal energy."

        {
            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "During a supervision session, the supervisor notices the supervisee's voice becoming high-pitched and strained while discussing a difficult case. What is the supervisor's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "To correct the supervisee's vocal tone immediately",
                "To ask the supervisee to provide more data on the client's history",
                "To use their own prosody and breath to co-regulate the supervisee's Sympathetic arousal",
                "To end the session as the supervisee is clearly too dysregulated to learn"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-pitched, strained voice (lack of prosody) indicates Sympathetic activation. The supervisor must first co-regulate the supervisee back to Ventral before continuing the clinical discussion."
