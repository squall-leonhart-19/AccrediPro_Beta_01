                "The ability to charge higher rates for standard 60-minute sessions.",
                "The shift from being a conduit for healing to being a facilitator of another's spiritual initiation and attunement.",
                "The requirement to stop seeing individual clients to focus solely on students.",
                "The mastery of physical massage techniques to complement Reiki energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition to Master-Teacher involves moving beyond personal practice into the sacred responsibility of initiating others into the Reiki lineage through the attunement process."

            "options": [
                "Group events are easier to market because they are cheaper.",
                "The 'Collective Resonance' created by a group can amplify the healing frequency and accelerate breakthroughs for participants.",
                "There is no energetic advantage; group sessions are purely for business efficiency.",
                "Group sessions allow the practitioner to use less energy because it is spread out."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group healing leverages 'Collective Resonance,' where the combined intention and energy of the group create a more powerful field than a single individual might experience alone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling requires automation; a CRM allows a Master-Teacher to track the complex journey of multiple students, including levels, attunements, and follow-up support without manual errors."

                "It allows the Reiki Master to diagnose mental health conditions.",
                "It creates a holistic 'bridge' where Reiki can help process the energetic or somatic release of emotional work done in therapy.",
                "It allows the practitioner to charge the therapist a commission for every client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic partnerships work best when services are complementary; Reiki provides a somatic and energetic outlet for the emotional processing that occurs in traditional psychotherapy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital products (courses, meditations, etc.) allow a practitioner to serve thousands of people simultaneously, removing the 'income ceiling' imposed by the number of hours in a day."

            "options": [
                "It is always cheaper for the client than hourly rates.",
                "It prices the 'result' or 'outcome' (e.g., a 12-week anxiety relief journey) rather than the time spent in the chair.",
                "It requires the practitioner to work 40 hours a week.",
                "It is a flat fee of $100 regardless of the service provided."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transformation-based pricing focuses on the value of the life-change the client receives, which justifies 'high-ticket' packages that provide more comprehensive support and better results."

                "The practitioner needs to switch to a different type of energy healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Legacy building involves creating unique frameworks and methodologies; trademarking and copyrighting these ensures the brand's value is preserved for future generations or potential sale."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling capacity requires 'Energetic Hygiene.' Buffer periods allow the practitioner to clear the previous client's energy and return to center, preventing energetic 'carry-over' and exhaustion."
