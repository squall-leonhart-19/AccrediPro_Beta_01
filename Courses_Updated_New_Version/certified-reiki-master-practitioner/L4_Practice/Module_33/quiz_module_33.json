            "options": [
                "Because chakras are not recognized by the FDA.",
                "Because it links an energetic observation to a medical diagnosis and suggests causality.",
                "Because practitioners are only allowed to discuss the crown and root chakras.",
                "It does not violate scope as long as the practitioner is a Reiki Master."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must avoid diagnosing medical conditions or attributing physical ailments to energetic states in a way that implies medical expertise. This crosses the line from energetic balancing into unlicensed medical diagnosis."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Not a Substitute' clause is the most critical legal protection, ensuring the client understands the boundaries of the service and the practitioner's lack of medical authority."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LLC provides a 'corporate veil' that separates personal assets from business liabilities, which is a primary reason practitioners choose this structure over a Sole Proprietorship."
