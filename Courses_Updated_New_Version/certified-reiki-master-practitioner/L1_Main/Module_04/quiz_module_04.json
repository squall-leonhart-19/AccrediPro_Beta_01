            "question": "Physiologically, the 'Restore' phase of Reiki is most closely associated with the activation of which system to facilitate cellular repair?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Somatic Nervous System",
                "The Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Restore phase focuses on shifting the client into a parasympathetic state (rest and digest), which lowers cortisol and allows the body's natural cellular repair mechanisms to function optimally."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "What is the primary function of the 'Etheric Template' in the context of Reiki restoration as discussed in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "It serves as the emotional storage unit for past traumas.",
                "It acts as the bridge between the crown chakra and the divine.",
                "It is the energetic blueprint that guides the physical body's cellular structure and regeneration.",
                "It is the outermost layer of the aura that protects against negative intent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Etheric Template is the first layer of the human energy field and serves as the holographic blueprint for the physical body; restoring this layer is essential for physical healing."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "When treating a client with severe adrenal fatigue and physical depletion, which hand placement protocol is emphasized in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "Directly over the eyes and temples",
                "The upper chest and throat area",
                "The lower back, specifically over the kidneys and adrenals",
                "The soles of the feet only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To address physical depletion and 'burnout,' Reiki is targeted at the kidneys and adrenal glands (lower back) to replenish the body's vital essence or 'Jing'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "According to the principles of 'Bio-Resonance' in Lesson 4, how does the Reiki Master's intent impact the client's restoration?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner's high-vibrational state creates a 'frequency match' that the client's cells entrain to.",
                "The practitioner must manually 'push' energy into depleted areas.",
                "The practitioner's intent creates a vacuum that sucks out toxins.",
                "Intent is secondary to the physical hand placement symbols."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bio-resonance occurs through entrainment, where the client's lower-vibrational (depleted) state naturally rises to match the stable, high-vibrational frequency held by the practitioner."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In the Restore phase, how is the Cho Ku Rei symbol specifically utilized to enhance 'Symbology of Vitality'?",
            "options": [
                "To release unwanted spirits from the room",
                "To amplify and 'lock in' the restorative energy into the physical cells",
                "To open a portal to the Akashic records",
                "To disconnect the practitioner's energy from the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the context of restoration, Cho Ku Rei acts as a 'power switch' and a seal, concentrating the Reiki energy and ensuring it remains within the client's field to continue the healing process."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Joshin Kokyu Ho involves breathing light into the Tanden (the body's center of gravity and energy reservoir) to build internal Ki before it is channeled to the client."

            "id": "q4_8",

                "The client begins to talk about their problems.",
                "The practitioner feels a 'magnetic pull' or heavy sensation in their hands stop, replaced by a light, steady flow.",
                "The client falls into a deep sleep (REM sleep).",
                "The room temperature drops significantly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a depleted area has been restored, the 'Byosen' (energetic sensation) usually shifts from a strong 'pull' or 'throb' to a smooth, uniform radiation, signaling the system is saturated."

            "id": "q4_9",

                "Adrenaline secretion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that Reiki facilitates restoration at a cellular level by enhancing mitochondrial function and the production of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the body's energy currency."
