            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "Avoid the area entirely as heat indicates 'too much' energy",
                "Apply heavy physical pressure to 'break' the heat sensation",
                "Hold the position until the sensation peaks and begins to subside or the 'pulse' slows",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
