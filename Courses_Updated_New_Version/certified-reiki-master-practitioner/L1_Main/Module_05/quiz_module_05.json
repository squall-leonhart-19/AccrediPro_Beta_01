            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "By allowing the practitioner to feel every pain the client feels in real-time",
                "By creating a 'neutral observer' state that prevents the practitioner from absorbing the client's trauma",
                "By making the practitioner completely emotionless and detached from the client",
                "By ensuring the practitioner's energy is always higher than the client's"
            ],

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Alpha-Theta bridge is the 'sweet spot' for centering, where the practitioner is deeply relaxed (Theta) yet remains consciously aware (Alpha)."
