            "question": "When scanning the biofield, a practitioner feels a 'cold, dense void' approximately three inches above the client's Solar Plexus. According to the Anatomy of Stagnation (L1), this most likely represents:",
            "options": [
                "An overactive energy center requiring grounding",
                "Chronic energetic depletion or a long-standing blockage",
                "Acute inflammation requiring cooling energy",
                "A healthy, clear flow of Ki"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cold spots or 'voids' typically indicate chronic stagnation or depletion where energy has ceased to circulate effectively, whereas heat often indicates acute inflammation or overactivity."

            "question": "A client reports feeling 'spiritually adrift' and experiences frequent tension headaches at the base of the skull. Which upper meridian clearing protocol (L2) should be the primary focus?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) is the gateway for spiritual connection and vertical alignment; blockages here often manifest as spiritual disconnection and physical tension in the upper cranium."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A spontaneous deep sigh or 'respiratory release' is a classic clinical indicator that the autonomic nervous system is shifting and emotional congestion in the Heart Gateway is moving."

                "Fluidity is only found in female clients, while power is only in male clients",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sacral center governs the 'fluid' aspects of life (emotions, creativity, sexuality), while the Solar Plexus governs the 'fire' or power aspects (will, boundaries, and identity)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An increase of 1-3 degrees Celsius in the extremities is a common clinical indicator of improved peripheral circulation and a shift into the parasympathetic 'rest and digest' state."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cooling breaths like Sitali help regulate the 'fire' of the Solar Plexus, assisting in the release of anger or inflammation without over-stimulating the nervous system."
