            "question": "According to the 'Physiology of Ki' research discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary mechanism by which the human biofield is thought to communicate information?",
            "options": [
                "Biophotonic emission and electromagnetic field (EMF) resonance",
                "Simple thermal radiation from skin contact",
                "Ultrasonic vibrations from muscle tissue",
                "Chemical signaling through perspiration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the body emits biophotons (ultra-weak light particles) and creates an electromagnetic field that acts as a communication network for subtle energy (Ki)."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "During a Byosen Reikan scan, you encounter a sensation of 'Chiku-chiku' (prickling or stinging). According to the 5 levels of Byosen, what does this indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Level 1: Gentle warmth indicating a healthy flow",
                "Level 2: Strong heat indicating a minor blockage",
                "Level 3: Prickling/stinging indicating a significant accumulation of toxins or stagnant energy",
                "Level 5: Numbness indicating a chronic, long-term depletion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chiku-chiku is the third level of Hibiki (sensations), representing a more intense accumulation of 'Byosen' or stagnant energy that requires targeted attention."

            "question": "In the 'Sacred Architecture' phase (Lesson 3), what is the primary purpose of the practitioner performing Gassho Meiso before the client arrives?",
            "options": [
                "To physically warm the hands for the client's comfort",
                "To diagnose the client's problems remotely",
                "To align the practitioner's internal channel and quiet the 'ego-mind'",
                "To clear the physical dust from the treatment room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sacred Architecture focuses on the practitioner becoming a 'clear hollow bamboo.' Gassho Meiso centers the practitioner, ensuring they are a neutral conduit for Reiki."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'Somatic Release' (involuntary twitching or deep sighing) during the Unblock phase. What is the most professional response according to the SOURCE protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the session as this is a sign of distress",
                "Apply heavy pressure to the area to stop the movement",
                "Maintain a light touch or hover (off-body) and allow the release to complete naturally",
                "Start the session over from the beginning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic releases are normal signs of the body processing energetic blockages. The practitioner should hold space and allow the process to finish without interference."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "What distinguishes the 'Restore' phase from the 'Unblock' phase in the SOURCE protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Unblock removes stagnant energy; Restore refills the area with high-vibrational resonance",
                "Unblock is done at the end; Restore is done at the beginning",
                "Unblock uses symbols; Restore does not use symbols",
                "There is no difference; they are the same step"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The SOURCE protocol follows a logical flow: first you clear the 'debris' (Unblock), then you replenish the 'vitality' (Restore) to ensure the client doesn't feel depleted."

            "id": "q8_6",

                "Kenyoku-ho (Dry Bathing)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kenyoku-ho is the 'dry bathing' technique used to clear the practitioner's own energy field and disconnect from the client's energetic state."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module regarding Reiki and the Autonomic Nervous System found that Reiki most consistently produces which physiological change?",
            "options": [
                "Increased cortisol production",
                "Increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and parasympathetic activation",
                "Decreased white blood cell count",
                "Increased blood pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reiki is scientifically shown to shift the body into the 'rest and digest' (parasympathetic) state, which is accurately measured via increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV)."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "When applying the 'Embody' phase (Lesson 7), how should a Master Practitioner utilize the Reiki Precepts (Gokai)?",
            "options": [
                "As a set of rules to judge the client's behavior",
                "As a daily meditative practice to maintain the practitioner's own vibration",
                "As a replacement for professional clinical ethics",
                "They should only be recited during the actual session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Precepts are for the practitioner's self-cultivation. By embodying the precepts daily, the practitioner remains a more effective and stable channel for Ki."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "In the SOURCE protocol, what is the 'C' in the acronym, and why is it vital for the client?",
            "options": [
                "Cleanse; to wash the client's hands",
                "Center; to ground the client's energy back into their physical body",
                "Calculate; to determine the cost of the session",
                "Communicate; to tell the client what you found during the scan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Center' phase (Integration and Grounding) ensures the client is fully 'back in their body' and grounded before they leave the session, preventing lightheadedness."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Regarding professional ethics in Lesson 8, if a practitioner 'sees' a specific medical diagnosis during a scan, what is the required action?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client exactly what disease they have",
                "Keep it a secret and do nothing",
                "Describe the energetic sensation (e.g., 'heaviness') and suggest the client see a physician for any physical concerns",
                "Prescribe a specific medication to fix the issue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reiki practitioners do not diagnose or prescribe. We report energetic observations and always refer clients to licensed medical professionals for physical diagnosis."
