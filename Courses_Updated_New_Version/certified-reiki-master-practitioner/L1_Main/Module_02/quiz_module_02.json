            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Gassho Meiso, focusing on the point where the middle fingers meet helps center the mind and serves as a physical anchor for the meditative state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Joshin Kokyu Ho is a 'cleansing breath' technique where Ki is drawn into the Tanden (the body's energetic center) to purify the practitioner's system and strengthen their aura."

            "options": [
                "Shielding requires too much physical equipment like crystals.",
                "Shielding is often rooted in a frequency of fear, which can actually attract lower-resonant energies.",
                "Boundaries are only necessary for beginner practitioners.",
                "Shielding prevents the practitioner from feeling any sensations during Byosen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sacred boundaries are based on resonance and sovereignty. Traditional 'shielding' often implies a state of fear or defensiveness, which can lower the practitioner's vibration."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Byosen refers to the 'frequency of the disharmony' felt in the hands. Detecting this allows the practitioner to identify where the body most needs energy."

            "options": [
                "S is the physical setup; O is the internal and energetic alignment of the practitioner.",
                "S is the treatment; O is the intake form.",
                "S is the invocation; O is the physical touch.",
                "S is the cleansing; O is the payment collection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'S' (Space) phase focuses on the external environment, while the 'O' (Open) phase focuses on the practitioner's internal state and the opening of the energetic connection."

                "The verbal intake of the client's symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Feeling drained (energetic 'vampirism' or 'sympathetic resonance') usually occurs when a practitioner fails to remain an 'Empty Vessel' and instead uses their own vital force or lacks clear boundaries."

            "id": "q2_10",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show that focused meditation like Gassho improves Heart Rate Variability (HRV), indicating a shift from the sympathetic (stress) to the parasympathetic (rest/digest) nervous system."
