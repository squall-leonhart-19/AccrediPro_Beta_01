            "options": [
                "They are high-frequency sound waves emitted during a Reiki session.",
                "They are ultra-weak light emissions from biological systems that facilitate cellular communication.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biophotons are ultra-weak light emissions (photons) from biological systems. Research suggests the biofield uses these emissions for non-local cellular communication, which Reiki practitioners interact with during energy work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
