            "question": "In the S.O.U.R.C.E. Method™ introduced in Lesson 1, what does the 'U' represent in the practitioner's workflow?",
            "options": [
                "Universal Alignment",
                "Use Symbols",
                "Unblock Meridians",
                "Underlying Cause Identification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The S.O.U.R.C.E. Method™ stands for Scan, Open, Use Symbols, Release, Center, and Embody. The 'U' phase is where the Level 2 practitioner specifically integrates Cho Ku Rei, Sei He Ki, and Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "When integrating symbols into Advanced Scanning (Byosen Reikan), which symbol is specifically used to 'laser-focus' the practitioner's sensitivity to detect subtle Hibiki (sensations)?",
            "options": [
                "Cho Ku Rei",
                "Sei He Ki",
                "Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen",
                "The Master Symbol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cho Ku Rei acts as a power amplifier. In advanced scanning, drawing it over the palms increases the practitioner's sensitivity to the five levels of Byosen, allowing for more precise detection of energetic blockages."

        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Psychic Hygiene, why is 'Kenyoku-ho' (Dry Bathing) considered essential after a Level 2 session?",
            "options": [
                "To recharge the practitioner's physical battery",
                "To disconnect the practitioner's energy from the client's emotional debris",
                "To activate the Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen connection",
                "To increase the temperature of the practitioner's hands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kenyoku-ho is a technique for 'psychic hygiene' used to sever the energetic connection between practitioner and client, ensuring that the practitioner does not carry the client's released emotional or mental 'sludge' after the session."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a deep-seated 'inner child' trauma that manifests as chronic anxiety. Which symbol is the primary tool for the 'Subconscious Unblocking' phase in Lesson 4?",

                "Kenyoku-ho"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sei He Ki is the mental/emotional symbol. It is specifically used to access the subconscious mind, bridge the left and right brain hemispheres, and release emotional patterns or traumas."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "In Non-Local Healing Protocols (Lesson 5), what is the 'Bridge' concept associated with Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen?",

                "The bridge between the practitioner and the Reiki Guides"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen is known as the 'Distance Symbol,' but its deeper synthesis is 'Non-locality,' meaning it allows the energy to bridge the gap across time (past/future) and space (distance)."

        {
            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "During the 'Power Amplification' phase (Lesson 6), what is the specific purpose of 'Sealing' the energy at the end of a session?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the client from feeling the effects too quickly",
                "To lock in the healing frequency and prevent energy leakage",
                "To ensure the practitioner gets paid for the session",
                "To stop the flow of Reiki permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sealing the energy using Cho Ku Rei ensures that the high-frequency shifts achieved during the session are stabilized within the client's auric field, preventing 'leakage' and allowing for a smoother integration period."

            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 emphasizes 'Holistic Embodiment.' What is the recommended 'Integration Period' for a client following a full Level 2 S.O.U.R.C.E. session?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistent with Usui's original 21-day fast on Mt. Kurama, a 21-day integration period is recommended for clients to fully process the cellular and energetic shifts of a Level 2 session."

            "id": "q18_8",

            "options": [
                "During the initial scanning phase",
                "When opening the sacred space",
                "When targeting a specific emotional blockage in the 'Use Symbols' phase",
                "Only during distance healing sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Sandwich Technique' uses Cho Ku Rei to amplify Sei He Ki, then another Cho Ku Rei to seal it. This is most effective during the 'Use Symbols' phase when addressing specific mental or emotional blockages."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module regarding non-local intention (distance healing) showed that practitioners using specific 'connection symbols' reported a ____% increase in client-perceived session depth compared to those using intention alone.",

                "15%",
                "42%",
                "67%",
                "89%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As noted in the scientific data sections of the module, structured symbol use (like HSZSN) correlates with a 42% increase in perceived depth and efficacy in distance healing sessions."

            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "The final step of the S.O.U.R.C.E. Method™ is 'Embody.' Which action best represents this step for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Drawing a large Cho Ku Rei over the client's whole body",
                "Providing the client with grounding instructions and post-session 'homework'",
                "Clearing the room with sage or incense",
                "Immediately starting the next client's session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Embodiment is about transition. The practitioner ensures the client is fully grounded (e.g., drinking water, feet on the floor) and provides practical steps to integrate the healing into their daily life."
