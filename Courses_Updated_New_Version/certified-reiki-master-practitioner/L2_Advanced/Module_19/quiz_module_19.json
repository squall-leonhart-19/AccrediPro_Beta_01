            "question": "Which specialized instrument is used in biofield research to measure the extremely weak magnetic fields (biomagnetic fields) produced by the human heart and brain?",
            "options": [
                "Electroencephalogram (EEG)",
                "Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)",

                "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SQUID is the most sensitive instrument available for measuring the minute magnetic fields generated by biological organisms, providing physical evidence for the existence of the biofield."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In clinical studies regarding pain management, how does Reiki typically perform when compared to 'Standard Care Alone' in post-operative settings?",
            "options": [
                "It shows no statistical difference.",
                "It increases pain sensitivity due to the 'healing crisis.'",
                "It significantly reduces perceived pain scores and the need for analgesic medication.",
                "It is only effective if the patient is under general anesthesia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple clinical trials indicate that Reiki as an adjunct to standard care leads to significant reductions in pain intensity and often decreases the patient's reliance on opioid medications."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "An increase in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) during a Reiki session is scientifically interpreted as an indicator of:",
            "options": [
                "Increased sympathetic nervous system arousal (Fight or Flight).",
                "A potential cardiac arrhythmia that requires medical attention.",

                "The 'Entrainment' of the practitioner's heart to the client's heart."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV is a primary marker for the autonomic nervous system; higher variability indicates that the body has shifted into a parasympathetic (rest and digest) state, which is a common physiological outcome of Reiki."

            "id": "q19_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Reiki is not a cure for cancer, evidence-based applications in oncology focus on 'supportive care,' where it excels at improving QoL, reducing anxiety, and managing treatment-related fatigue."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Placebo Debate,' what is a 'Sham Reiki' control group?",
            "options": [
                "A group that receives no treatment at all.",
                "A group that receives Reiki from a Master, but is told it is a placebo.",
                "A group that receives touch or hand positions from an untrained person mimicking Reiki gestures.",
                "A group that is treated using crystals instead of hands."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sham Reiki involves a person who is not trained in Reiki mimicking the hand positions to control for the effects of 'expectation' and 'human touch,' allowing researchers to see if 'Actual Reiki' has a specific effect."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Biophoton research suggests that biological systems emit ultra-weak light. What is the proposed role of these biophotons in biofield science?",
            "options": [
                "They are waste products of cellular metabolism with no function.",
                "They act as a form of high-speed electromagnetic communication between cells.",
                "They are only visible to practitioners with 'opened' third eyes.",
                "They are responsible for the heat felt during a Reiki session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biophoton theory suggests that cells use these light emissions to communicate and coordinate biological processes instantaneously, providing a potential mechanism for how biofield therapies influence the body."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "When critically appraising a Reiki study, which of the following is considered the HIGHEST level of evidence?",

                "A Systematic Review or Meta-analysis of multiple RCTs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In the hierarchy of evidence, Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses sit at the top because they synthesize the data from many different studies to find a consensus on efficacy."

                "Blood Oxygen saturation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Salivary Cortisol is a standard 'stress hormone' marker. Research has shown that Reiki can lead to a measurable drop in cortisol levels, correlating with the client's reported feeling of relaxation."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "According to the 'Evidence-Informed Practice' model, how should a Reiki Master integrate research into their professional practice?",
            "options": [
                "By only using techniques that have been proven in a laboratory.",
                "By ignoring research and relying solely on intuition and tradition.",
                "By balancing the best available research with clinical expertise and the client's values.",
                "By telling clients that Reiki is scientifically proven to cure all diseases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-Informed Practice is a 'triad' approach that combines the best scientific evidence with the practitioner's experience and the unique needs/preferences of the client."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "What is a common methodological limitation cited in many current Reiki research studies that prevents them from being 'definitive'?",
            "options": [
                "Reiki is impossible to study using the scientific method.",
                "Small sample sizes (n-values) and lack of standardized protocols.",
                "The fact that Reiki energy cannot be measured by a thermometer.",
                "Scientists are biased and refuse to publish positive Reiki results."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many Reiki studies suffer from small sample sizes (not enough participants) and variations in how the Reiki was administered, making it difficult to generalize the results across the entire population."
