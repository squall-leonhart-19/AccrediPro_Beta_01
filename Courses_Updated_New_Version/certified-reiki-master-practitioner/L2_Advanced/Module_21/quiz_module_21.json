            "options": [
                "The use of physical hand positions only",
                "The transition from reactive 'spot-treating' to proactive, multi-dimensional mapping using symbols",
                "The requirement to perform sessions in a clinical hospital setting",
                "The exclusion of the client's personal history from the intake process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level (Okuden) planning involves strategic mapping and the integration of symbols to address the root causes of imbalances across physical, emotional, and spiritual layers, rather than just reacting to physical symptoms."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to charge higher insurance rates",
                "It provides a visual and data-driven record of how energetic 'hibernation' or 'heat' changes over a series of treatments",
                "It replaces the need for a physical medical diagnosis",
                "It is used to predict the client's future health outcomes with 100% certainty"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Byosen tracking documents the intensity and location of energetic sensations (Hibiki), allowing the practitioner to see progress and adjust the treatment plan based on real energetic feedback."

            "options": [
                "The protocol should focus on long-term subconscious reprogramming immediately",
                "The protocol should prioritize immediate 'Energetic First Aid'—frequent, shorter sessions focused on grounding and calming the nervous system",
                "Acute conditions do not require Reiki and should be referred out immediately",
                "There is no difference between acute and chronic protocol design"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acute imbalances require immediate stabilization and grounding. Frequent, shorter sessions help the client manage the immediate 'surge' of stress before moving into deeper work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Empowerment Gap occurs when a client relies solely on the practitioner for balance. Ethical termination involves closing this gap by providing self-care tools and 'graduating' the client."

            "explanation": "Progressive Resonant Mapping involves evolving the distance treatment plan based on the client’s reported shifts and the practitioner’s energetic feedback during the connection."
