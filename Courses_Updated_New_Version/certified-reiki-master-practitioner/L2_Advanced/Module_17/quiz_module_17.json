            "options": [
                "To continue the session and push through the energy block",
                "To immediately stop the session and call emergency services",
                "To provide containment, ensure physical safety, and facilitate grounding",
                "To perform an aura clearing to remove the negative energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the event of an abreaction, the practitioner must act as a 'container,' ensuring the client is safe and using grounding techniques (like foot contact or verbal cues) to bring them back to the present moment."

                "To replace the need for pharmacological pain management"
            ],

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Reiki supports detoxification and metabolic processes; if performed while anesthesia is active, it may cause the medication to clear the system faster than intended."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Burnout is specific to trauma work, while compassion fatigue is general stress",
                "Compassion fatigue is the 'cost of caring' for traumatized clients, while burnout relates to workload and environment",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms",
                "Compassion fatigue only affects the client, not the practitioner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue is a form of secondary traumatic stress resulting from helping those in distress, whereas burnout is a state of physical/emotional exhaustion caused by long-term stress."

            "id": "q17_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation requires immediate, gentle grounding. Using sensory cues (naming objects) helps re-engage the prefrontal cortex and brings the client back to the present."

                "To prevent the skin from knitting back together",
                "To soften the energetic 'holding' and improve the flow of Qi through the meridian pathways",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
