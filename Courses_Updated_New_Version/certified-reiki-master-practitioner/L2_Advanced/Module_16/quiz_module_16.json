            "question": "In Lesson 1, when utilizing Byosen Reikan (scanning) for chronic physical pain, which level of 'Hibiki' (sensation) is characterized by a strong tingling that may feel like a mild electric current?",
            "options": [
                "Netsutsu (Heat)",
                "Kan-ni (Coldness)",
                "Hibiki (Tingling/Vibration)",
                "Itami (Pain)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hibiki refers to the specific vibrating or tingling sensation that indicates the Reiki is actively moving through a blockage in the energetic field."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "When addressing deep-seated emotional trauma using the Sei He Ki symbol (Lesson 2), what is the primary energetic objective during the 'Unblock' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to relive the memory for catharsis",
                "To create a bridge between the conscious and subconscious mind to release trapped energy",
                "To seal the aura so the trauma cannot be accessed",
                "To replace the trauma with physical vitality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sei He Ki acts as a key to the subconscious, allowing trapped emotional energy (trauma) to be processed and released without necessarily re-traumatizing the client."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the case of distance healing for mental clarity (Lesson 3), which protocol is recommended to address 'brain fog' and lack of focus?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on the Root Chakra to ground the thoughts",
                "Using Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen to send Reiki to the client's past academic failures",
                "The 'Open & Embody' protocol, focusing on the Third Eye and Crown while maintaining a grounding cord",
                "Using only the Power Symbol on the Solar Plexus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mental clarity requires opening the upper chakras (Third Eye/Crown) while ensuring the energy is 'embodied' through grounding to prevent lightheadedness."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4, a client with chronic anxiety and 'adrenal burnout' often shows a significant deficiency in which chakra energy?",
            "options": [
                "Root Chakra (Muladhara)",
                "Heart Chakra (Anahata)",

                "Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anxiety and adrenal issues are deeply linked to the Root Chakra; a lack of 'grounding' energy causes the nervous system to remain in a constant state of fight-or-flight."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When performing 'Heart Restoration' for grief (Lesson 5), why does the practitioner treat the 'Back Heart' (between the shoulder blades)?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is the easiest place to reach",
                "To address the 'unconscious' storage of grief and the ability to receive support",
                "To stimulate the lungs for better oxygen intake",
                "To bypass the client's emotional resistance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The back of the Heart Chakra is associated with the past and the subconscious ability to receive love and support, which is often blocked during periods of deep loss."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",

            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for physical physical therapy",
                "It prevents the surgeon from making mistakes",
                "It helps the cells release the 'energetic shock' of the trauma, potentially accelerating physical knitting",
                "It changes the DNA of the client permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Surgery is a form of 'controlled trauma'; treating the cellular memory helps the physical tissue release the energetic imprint of the 'attack' (the incision), facilitating faster recovery."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses addiction and behavioral patterns. What role does the 'Embody' phase play in breaking a habit?",
            "options": [
                "It creates a physical aversion to the substance",
                "It integrates the new, higher-frequency energetic blueprint into the daily physical experience",
                "It replaces the need for a support group",
                "It focuses purely on the Solar Plexus for willpower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breaking patterns requires more than just 'clearing'; the 'Embody' phase ensures the client's energy field can sustain a new frequency that no longer resonates with the old habit."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the 'Integrative Master Case' (Lesson 8), if a practitioner encounters a 'shifting' Byosen (where the sensation moves from the hip to the shoulder), what does this typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner is losing focus",
                "The client is resisting the treatment",
                "The energy is tracking a 'meridian line' or an emotional connection between different body parts",
                "The Reiki is not working"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shifting sensations often reveal the 'root' of a problem; for example, hip pain may be energetically linked to a lack of support (shoulder) or a fear of moving forward."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Based on the case studies, what is the 'Golden Rule' of Reiki Master practice when dealing with multi-layered healing (Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual)?",
            "options": [
                "Always treat the physical symptom first",
                "Treat the person, not the diagnosis, by following the flow of energy (Hibiki)",
                "Only use the Master Symbol for the first 30 minutes",
                "Tell the client exactly which emotion is causing their cancer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reiki Masters focus on the energetic imbalances (Hibiki) rather than trying to 'fix' a medical diagnosis, allowing the energy to prioritize the layers of healing required."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module regarding Reiki and post-surgical recovery showed that patients receiving Reiki reported a significant reduction in:",
            "options": [
                "The cost of the surgery",
                "The time spent in the operating room",
                "Post-operative pain and the need for analgesic medication",
                "The number of stitches required"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data consistently shows that Reiki's primary post-surgical benefit is the reduction of perceived pain and a decreased reliance on pain medications through parasympathetic activation."
