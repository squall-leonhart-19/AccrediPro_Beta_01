                "A complete absence of energy in that area",
                "The client is experiencing an emotional release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While clockwise movement is generally positive, an excessively wide or 'aggressive' swing indicates an overactive chakra that may be compensating for other areas or causing distress."

                "To diagnose medical conditions for the client's physician",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In distance work, practitioners use a surrogate (like a teddy bear, a crystal, or their own body) to 'map' the client's energy, allowing the practitioner to feel Hibiki as if the client were physically present."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'cold' or 'void' sensation in the mental layer often signifies areas where the client has 'checked out' or is experiencing mental exhaustion/stagnation of thought patterns."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the S.O.U.R.C.E. framework, 'S' stands for Scan/Survey, which is the dedicated time for energetic assessment before the full treatment begins."

            "question": "Which level of Hibiki is described as 'Itami' (Pain) and what does it signify to the Reiki Master?",
            "options": [
                "The lowest level; signifies the client is relaxed",
                "The highest level; signifies the practitioner is taking on the client's karma",
                "The fifth level; signifies significant energetic blockage or the movement of a deep-seated 'echo' of a past injury",
                "A neutral level; signifies the session is over"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Itami (Pain) is the fifth and strongest level of Hibiki. It indicates a significant blockage or the point where the body is working hardest to process a deep-seated issue."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic lower back pain. During scanning, you find no Hibiki in the lower back but intense 'Atsui' (Strong Heat) in the Throat Chakra. How should you proceed based on assessment principles?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the throat and focus only on the back because that is where the pain is",
                "Tell the client they have a thyroid problem",
                "Treat the back, but prioritize the throat as the 'source' or 'compensatory' energetic blockage",
                "Stop the session and refer them to a massage therapist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reiki assessment often reveals that the 'source' of an energetic imbalance is not where the physical pain manifests. Treating the area of strongest Hibiki (the throat) addresses the energetic root while still providing local support to the symptom (the back)."
