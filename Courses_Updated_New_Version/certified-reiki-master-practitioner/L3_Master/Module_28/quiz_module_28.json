            "question": "According to the principles of the 'Menken' healing crisis, what is the primary indicator that a client is moving through a deep energetic detoxification?",
            "options": [
                "An immediate and permanent disappearance of all physical symptoms",
                "A temporary intensification of symptoms followed by significant improvement",
                "The client falling into a deep sleep for more than 12 hours",
                "A sudden aversion to all forms of energy healing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healing crisis (often associated with the Herxheimer reaction in clinical terms) involves a temporary 'flare-up' of symptoms as the body and energetic system purge toxins and suppressed emotions before reaching a higher state of health."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "When working with a terminal client in the 'active dying' phase, what is the Reiki Master's primary ethical and energetic objective?",
            "options": [
                "Attempting to reverse the pathology and 'cure' the physical body",
                "Using high-frequency symbols to keep the client conscious as long as possible",
                "Facilitating a peaceful transition and supporting the 'soul's release' from the physical vessel",
                "Providing nutritional advice to prolong life"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In end-of-life care, the focus shifts from 'curing' (fixing the body) to 'healing' (wholeness in transition). The practitioner acts as an 'energetic midwife' to support a peaceful and dignified departure."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "In Advanced Trauma-Informed Reiki for PTSD, why is 'client agency' regarding touch considered the most critical protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Because touch is always more effective than distance healing",
                "To prevent the practitioner from absorbing the client's trauma",
                "To avoid triggering a 'freeze' or 'dissociative' response by respecting the client's physical boundaries",
                "Because it is required by state massage laws"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma survivors often feel a loss of control over their bodies. Allowing the client to choose between touch, hovering, or distance work empowers them and prevents the nervous system from perceiving the treatment as a threat."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "When managing chronic and degenerative pathologies like Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinson’s, what is the recommended session strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Infrequent, high-intensity sessions every 3 months",
                "Shorter, more frequent sessions (20-30 minutes) to avoid overtaxing the nervous system",
                "Strict adherence to a 90-minute full-body protocol regardless of fatigue",
                "Only providing Reiki during acute flare-ups"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients with degenerative conditions often have sensitive nervous systems. Shorter, frequent sessions provide a consistent 'calming' signal without overwhelming their already taxed energetic capacity."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A client in a psychiatric setting is experiencing active hallucinations or a loss of reality testing (psychosis). What is the safest course of action for a Reiki Master?",
            "options": [
                "Perform an intensive Third Eye (Ajna) activation to clear the mind",
                "Consult with the clinical team and focus only on grounding the feet and lower chakras",
                "Tell the client their hallucinations are merely 'spirit guides'",
                "Increase the session length to 2 hours to force a breakthrough"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In psychiatric contexts, especially with psychosis, 'opening' the upper chakras can exacerbate dissociation. Grounding the lower centers helps tether the client to physical reality and should be done in conjunction with clinical oversight."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In a Post-Surgical or ICU environment, which protocol should be prioritized to ensure patient safety and medical compliance?",
            "options": [
                "Removing medical monitors to clear the energetic field",
                "Focusing on the site of surgery for at least 45 minutes",
                "Adapting to the environment by using 'hovering' techniques and keeping sessions brief (15-20 min)",
                "Asking the patient to sit up to align their spine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hospital protocols require that Reiki practitioners do not interfere with medical equipment. Brief sessions are necessary because ICU patients are often highly fragile and easily overstimulated."

        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "When providing 'Energetic First Aid' for acute physical trauma (e.g., a sudden fall or accident), what is the first energetic priority?",
            "options": [
                "Analyzing the karmic cause of the accident",
                "Sealing leaks in the auric field and stabilizing the client's shock response",
                "Performing a full 12-position hand sequence",
                "Attempting to set broken bones energetically"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acute trauma causes the aura to 'shatter' or leak energy rapidly, leading to shock. The priority is to stabilize the field, seal the energy, and ground the client while waiting for medical professionals."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "A Reiki Master working with complex cases begins to experience 'Vicarious Trauma.' Which symptom most likely indicates this condition?",
            "options": [
                "Feeling physically stronger after every session",
                "An increased sense of empathy and joy",
                "Intrusive thoughts about a client's trauma and emotional exhaustion",
                "A sudden mastery of new Reiki symbols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vicarious trauma (or compassion fatigue) occurs when a practitioner takes on the emotional burden of their clients' stories, leading to burnout and secondary traumatic stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "During a session for PTSD, a client's eyes roll back and they stop responding to verbal cues (dissociation). What is the immediate 'Grounding Protocol'?",
            "options": [
                "Gently call the client's name and ask them to name three objects they see in the room",
                "Deepen the Reiki flow to the crown chakra to bring them back",
                "Leave the room and wait for them to wake up",
                "Shake the client vigorously to snap them out of it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Grounding protocols for dissociation involve 'orienting' the client to the present moment and physical environment through sensory engagement (sight, sound, touch)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "Which ethical boundary is most important when a Reiki Master is integrated into a multi-disciplinary crisis team?",
            "options": [
                "Providing medical diagnoses based on 'Byosen' scanning",
                "Respecting the scope of practice and never overriding the advice of medical or mental health professionals",
                "Insisting that Reiki is the only valid form of treatment",
                "Charging double for hospital visits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, the Reiki Master is part of a team. It is ethically mandatory to stay within the scope of practice (energy work) and defer to medical/clinical experts for diagnosis and treatment plans."
