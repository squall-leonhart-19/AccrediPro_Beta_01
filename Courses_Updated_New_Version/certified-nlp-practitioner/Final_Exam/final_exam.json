            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'N' in N.E.U.R.O. stands for Notice & Calibrate, which focuses on sensory acuity and rapport building to understand the client's current state before intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
