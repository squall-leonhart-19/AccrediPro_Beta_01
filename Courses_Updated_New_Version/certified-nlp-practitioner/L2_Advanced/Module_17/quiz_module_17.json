                "An unconscious benefit the client receives from maintaining the problematic behavior.",
                "A plateau in the learning curve where the brain refuses new neural pathways.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain is the hidden, often unconscious, positive benefit a person derives from a symptom or 'negative' behavior, which creates resistance to change."

            "question": "During an Advanced Ecology check, you ask the client: 'What will happen in your family dynamic if you become a high-earning executive?' This specifically addresses which concept?",

                "Behavioral changes are permanent and do not require mindset shifts.",
                "Identity beliefs (e.g., 'I am a failure') act as the foundation for multiple sub-beliefs and behaviors.",
                "NLP practitioners are legally required to work only on identity.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-level beliefs are at the top of the logical levels; changing a core 'I am' belief often causes a cascade of positive changes across behaviors, skills, and environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parts Integration relies on finding the 'common ground' or highest positive intention that both parts share, which allows them to stop conflicting and start collaborating."

            "question": "A high-performance athlete experiences 'choking' during a crisis. As a practitioner, you notice their breathing is shallow and their muscles are rigid. This calibration suggests they are in which state?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rigidity and shallow breathing are physiological markers of the sympathetic nervous system taking over, indicating a high-stress or crisis state that requires immediate state-management intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "V-K Dissociation (Rewind Technique) uses double dissociation to allow the client to process the memory without being overwhelmed by the associated kinesthetic (emotional) feelings."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Homeostasis is a system's internal mechanism to maintain stability. If one person changes, the system (family/group) often exerts pressure to pull them back to their old role."
