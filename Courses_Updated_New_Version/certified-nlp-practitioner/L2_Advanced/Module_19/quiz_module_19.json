            "question": "According to the modern research landscape discussed in Lesson 1, what was a primary criticism of early NLP (1970s-80s) that modern evidence-based practitioners seek to rectify?",
            "options": [
                "The complete absence of any theoretical framework.",
                "The reliance on anecdotal success rather than standardized, peer-reviewed clinical trials.",
                "The refusal to use any terminology from traditional psychology.",
                "The focus on long-term therapy rather than brief interventions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early NLP faced criticism for lack of empirical rigor; modern practitioners bridge this gap by utilizing peer-reviewed data and standardized protocols like the RTM (Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural Plasticity is the foundation of NLP's efficacy, allowing for the 'rewiring' of thought patterns through techniques that stimulate synaptic changes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow an individual to 'internally simulate' the actions and emotions of another, providing the biological foundation for pacing, leading, and rapport."

            "options": [
                "The brain uses different regions for imagination and actual perception.",
                "Mental imagery activates approximately 90% of the same neural pathways as actual visual perception.",
                "Auditory processing is more effective than visual processing for habit change.",
                "Submodalities are only effective if the client is in a deep hypnotic state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional Equivalence demonstrates that the brain processes vivid mental imagery similarly to real-world stimuli, explaining why changing submodalities can alter emotional responses."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hebbian Theory (Long-Term Potentiation) explains that simultaneous activation of neurons (a stimulus and a state) strengthens the synaptic connection between them, forming an anchor."

            "options": [
                "Less than 30%",
                "Approximately 50% with weekly sessions for one year",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The RTM protocol, based on NLP's V-K Dissociation, has shown remarkable efficacy in clinical trials, often exceeding 90% success in resolving PTSD symptoms in limited sessions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Meta-Model specifically targets the linguistic 'violations' of deletion, distortion, and generalization to move from the 'Surface Structure' to the 'Deep Structure' of experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Left Prefrontal Cortex is associated with positive emotions and goal-directed behavior. NLP resource anchors help shift activation from the amygdala to the PFC."

            "question": "Why is 'Calibration' considered a biological skill rather than just a psychological one?",
            "options": [
                "Because it requires the practitioner to have 20/20 vision.",
                "Because it involves observing minute changes in the client's Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), such as skin color and breathing.",
                "Because it only works if the client is taking specific neurological supplements.",
                "Because it is based on the practitioner's DNA."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calibration is the observation of physiological 'micro-cues' that reflect the internal state of the client's nervous system, allowing for precise intervention timing."
