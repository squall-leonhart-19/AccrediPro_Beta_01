            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "In advanced calibration, which physiological indicator is considered a primary marker for detecting shifts in the autonomic nervous system during a state change?",
            "options": [
                "Changes in pupil dilation and skin color (vasodilation/vasoconstriction)",
                "The specific pitch of the client's voice",
                "The speed at which the client blinks",
                "The choice of adjectives used in a sentence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Advanced calibration focuses on physiological micro-shifts. Pupil dilation and skin color changes are involuntary responses of the autonomic nervous system, making them highly reliable indicators of state shifts."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client states, 'I want to start this fitness program so I don't feel sluggish and tired anymore.' Which Meta-Program is being primarily expressed?",
            "options": [
                "Toward orientation",
                "Away-from orientation",
                "Internal Frame of Reference",
                "Proactive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client is motivated by moving away from a negative state ('sluggish and tired') rather than moving toward a positive goal, which characterizes an 'Away-from' Meta-Program."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "Which set of predicates would most likely be used by a client with a dominant Auditory Digital (Ad) representational system?",
            "options": [
                "'I see what you mean; it looks clear.'",
                "'That feels heavy; I can't grasp the concept.'",
                "'I need to process this information to see if it makes sense logically.'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Auditory Digital (Ad) processing is characterized by logic, data, and internal dialogue. Predicates like 'process,' 'information,' 'sense,' and 'logically' are hallmarks of this system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard NLP elicitation question for values is 'What is important to you about...?' as it bypasses surface-level desires to reach the underlying criteria/values."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "In the standard Eye Accessing Cues model, if a normally organized right-handed client looks down and to their own left (the practitioner's right), they are likely accessing:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "For a standard right-handed individual, looking down and to their left (the client's left) indicates Internal Dialogue or Auditory Digital (Ad) processing."

            "id": "q20_6",

            "options": [
                "'I am depressed.'",
                "'He makes me angry.'",

                "'It is important to be on time.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Universal Quantifiers are words like 'never,' 'always,' 'everyone,' and 'nobody' that generalize an experience across all instances. 'She never listens' is a classic example."

                "The positive benefit or protection the client receives from keeping their current problem",
                "The speed at which the client can enter a trance state",
                "The number of Meta-Model violations in a single sentence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Gain refers to the hidden positive intention or benefit that a problematic behavior provides. Assessing this is crucial for ensuring the ecology of the change."

                "User Experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The N.E.U.R.O. Protocol stands for Neurology, Ecology, Underlying Beliefs & Values, Representational Systems, and Outcomes. 'U' specifically targets the deep structure of the client's belief hierarchy."

                "External feedback and praise from their manager",
                "Following a checklist provided by an expert",

                "What their peers think about their performance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with an Internal Frame of Reference decide for themselves based on their own criteria. They are often demotivated by being told what to do or by external praise that doesn't match their self-assessment."

                "A person's name is forgotten",
                "A process (verb) has been turned into a static event or thing (noun)",

                "A specific detail is left out of the sentence entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nominalizations are 'frozen' processes. Words like 'relationship,' 'communication,' or 'failure' are verbs turned into nouns, which hides the active process and makes the problem seem unchangeable."
