            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modeling is the core of NLP. While Practitioners apply techniques, Master Practitioners use modeling to deconstruct human excellence and create new interventions."

            "question": "During advanced calibration (Lesson 2), you notice a client's lower lip slightly thickens and the skin color flushes. According to sensory acuity standards, this most likely indicates:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Changes in lip size and skin color (vasodilation) are primary physiological indicators of kinesthetic shifts and autonomic nervous system changes."

            "question": "A client states: 'I need to finish this project by Friday so I don't lose my bonus and feel like a failure.' Which Metaprogram is most dominant in this statement?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rank-ordering reveals the hierarchy of what is most important to the client, allowing the practitioner to see if higher-level values are in conflict with lower-level behaviors."

                "Only works on physical health issues",
                "Focuses on the 'Core State' (e.g., Peace, Being) rather than just behavioral outcomes",
                "Requires the client to be in a deep state of somnambulism",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chunking up moves from the specific to the general/abstract, which is often used to find common ground or resolve conflict at a higher level of logic."
