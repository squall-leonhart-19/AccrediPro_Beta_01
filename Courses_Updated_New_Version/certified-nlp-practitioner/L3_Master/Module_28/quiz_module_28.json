            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "An NLP practitioner notices a client exhibiting 'Word Salad,' delusions of grandeur, and claims of hearing external auditory commands. According to the Ethical Boundaries lesson, what is the required action?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate referral to a licensed clinical psychiatrist or emergency services.",
                "Utilizing the Meta-Model to challenge the deletions in their speech.",
                "Applying the Parts Integration technique to reconcile the conflicting voices.",
                "Using the Swish Pattern to replace the delusions with empowering goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Active psychosis, including hallucinations and disorganized speech (word salad), is a clear 'Red Flag' that falls outside the scope of NLP coaching and requires immediate clinical intervention."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "During a session, a client experiences 'Acute Emotional Flooding.' Which physiological state should the practitioner guide them into first to achieve rapid de-escalation?",
            "options": [
                "Deep REM-style eye movement.",
                "The 'Learning State' (Peripheral Vision/Hakalau).",
                "Hyperventilation to release pent-up energy.",
                "Closed-eye internal visualization of the trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Expanding the visual field into peripheral vision (the Learning State) activates the parasympathetic nervous system, effectively 'switching off' the fight-or-flight response during emotional flooding."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "In the 'Advanced V-K Dissociation' protocol for trauma, what is the specific role of the 'Double Dissociation' (the projection booth)?",
            "options": [
                "To make the client feel the emotions more intensely for 'catharsis'.",
                "To allow the client to watch themselves watching the event, creating a safe cognitive distance.",
                "To delete the memory from the client's long-term storage.",
                "To change the sub-modalities of the memory from color to black and white only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Double dissociation (watching yourself in a projection booth watching yourself on a screen) provides the necessary safety distance to process traumatic content without re-traumatization."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Which characteristic distinguishes 'Systemic Anxiety' from a 'Simple Phobia'?",
            "options": [
                "Systemic anxiety has a single, identifiable trigger like a spider or height.",
                "Systemic anxiety is always cured in a single 15-minute session.",
                "Systemic anxiety is generalized across multiple contexts and often lacks a specific external stimulus.",
                "Systemic anxiety only occurs in children under the age of 12."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While phobias are context-specific, systemic anxiety is 'free-floating' and generalized, often requiring a more comprehensive approach than the Fast Phobia Cure."

            "id": "q28_5",

                "To erase the memory of the deceased person from the past.",
                "To move the loss to the 'Future' timeline so the client forgets it happened.",
                "To help the client integrate the lessons and love into their identity while opening up a viable future.",
                "To prove to the client that the loss was not actually important."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity reconstruction focuses on honoring the past while ensuring the client's future timeline is not 'blocked' by the weight of the grief."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Addictive Patterns, why does the 'Threshold Pattern' work effectively for compulsive behaviors?",
            "options": [
                "It uses logic to convince the client that the behavior is expensive.",
                "It pushes the sub-modalities of the compulsion to a 'breaking point' where the brain finds the behavior repulsive.",
                "It relies on the practitioner's authority to command the client to stop.",
                "It replaces the addiction with a different, healthier addiction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Threshold Pattern (or 'Compulsion Blowout') works by taking the driver sub-modalities of a compulsion and 'spinning' or amplifying them until the brain's neurological threshold is reached, causing a reversal of the desire."

                "The financial compensation received from insurance for a chronic illness.",
                "An unconscious benefit or 'positive intention' the client receives from maintaining a symptom.",
                "The improvement in health after the first NLP session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the hidden benefits a symptom provides, such as receiving attention, avoiding responsibilities, or feeling safe, which must be addressed for the symptom to resolve."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "A practitioner feels drained, irritable, and starts 'carrying' client problems home. Based on Lesson 8, what is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner is not charging enough money.",
                "Vicarious trauma/Compassion fatigue due to a lack of professional supervision and state-clearing.",
                "The client is using 'Resistance' as a sub-modality.",
                "The practitioner needs to learn more Meta-Model patterns."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma occur when practitioners absorb the emotional weight of complex cases without proper supervision, self-care, and 'clearing' techniques."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "When applying the 'Six-Step Reframing' to a chronic health challenge, what is the critical step after identifying the part responsible for the symptom?",
            "options": [
                "Telling the part to go away immediately.",
                "Asking the part to reveal its 'Positive Intention' for the client.",
                "Visualizing the symptom turning into a bright light.",
                "Using an anchor to stop the symptom from occurring."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The core of Six-Step Reframing is identifying the 'Positive Intention' of the part, as symptoms are often the body's way of communicating a need that isn't being met."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A 2021 study on NLP-based trauma interventions (referenced in L3) showed that V-K Dissociation was most effective when:",
            "options": [
                "The client was in a deep hypnotic trance for at least 60 minutes.",
                "The practitioner maintained 'Calibration' and ensured the client remained in a dissociated state during the process.",
                "The client was encouraged to relive the trauma as vividly as possible.",
                "The process was repeated 50 times in a single day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calibration is vital; if the client 'associates' into the trauma during the protocol, it can cause re-traumatization. The success of V-K Dissociation depends on maintaining the dissociated state."
