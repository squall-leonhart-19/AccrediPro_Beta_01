            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mental rehearsal in NLP involves a vivid, multi-sensory (VAKOG) internal simulation of a performance, which helps strengthen the neural pathways associated with the physical movement."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "explanation": "The strategy flows from the 'Dreamer' (vision/possibility) to the 'Realist' (implementation/plan) and finally to the 'Critic' (identifying gaps/risks). The Critic should never talk directly to the Dreamer."
