                "To install new belief systems immediately",
                "To calibrate the client's current state and sensory baseline",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'N' (Notice) phase focuses on Calibration and Sensory Acuity, establishing a baseline of the client's physiology and internal state before intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Changes in skin color (flushing or paling) are key calibration markers indicating shifts in the autonomic nervous system, often signaling an emotional or state change."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In Outcome Architecture (The 'E'), the 'Well-Formedness' criteria require a goal to be 'Ecology Checked.' What does this mean?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ecology refers to the study of consequences; an ecology check ensures the change won't have negative ripple effects on other areas of the client's life."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Driver is a submodality (like size, distance, or brightness) that has the most leverage over the client's emotional response to an internal image."

                "Just beginning to feel the emotion",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anchoring is most effective when the stimulus is applied at the peak of the state's intensity to create a strong neurological association."

                "To predict the client's future using intuition",
                "To mentally rehearse the new behavior in future high-risk scenarios to ensure it triggers automatically",
                "To set a deadline for the client's goals",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing acts as a 'mental bridge,' ensuring the new resources are available and automatically triggered in the specific contexts where they are needed."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "During a session, a client uses the word 'Always' (e.g., 'I always fail'). Which Meta-Model challenge is most effective for this Universal Quantifier?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
