            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "In the N.E.U.R.O. Architecture framework for advanced integration, what does the 'E' specifically represent to ensure long-term change?",
            "options": [
                "External Validation",
                "Ecological Equilibrium",
                "Emotional Elasticity",
                "Enacted Expectancy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ecological Equilibrium refers to checking how the new integration fits within the client's wider life systems and internal parts to prevent self-sabotage."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "When practicing Micro-Calibration (L2), which physiological shift is considered the most reliable indicator of an internal state change because it is largely involuntary?",
            "options": [
                "Hand gestures",
                "Verbal tone",
                "Pupil dilation/constriction",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pupil dilation and constriction are controlled by the autonomic nervous system and occur almost instantaneously with state shifts, making them high-fidelity calibration markers."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In Complex Outcome Engineering, what is the primary risk of failing to identify 'Nested Goals' within a client's primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "The client will achieve the goal too quickly",
                "The goal will lack linguistic precision",
                "Hidden secondary gains may cause the client to revert to old behaviors",
                "The Milton Model cannot be applied"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nested goals often contain secondary gains. If these are not addressed, the subconscious may block the primary goal to protect the benefits of the current state."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "A client states: 'Everyone thinks I'm a failure.' According to the Meta-Model Deep Dive, which specific pattern is this, and what is the appropriate challenge?",

                "Universal Quantifier; 'Everyone? Who specifically?'",
                "Modal Operator; 'What stops you?'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "'Everyone' is a Universal Quantifier. The challenge requires finding a counter-example or specifying the group to break the over-generalization."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which Milton Model pattern is being used in the following sentence: 'You might find yourself becoming more relaxed now, or perhaps you'll notice a sense of calm later'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This is a Double Bind (specifically an 'Illusion of Choice') where both options offered (relaxing now or later) lead to the same therapeutic outcome."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "During a Swish Pattern deep dive, what is the 'Driver Submodality'?",
            "options": [
                "The submodality that, when changed, causes all other submodalities to shift",
                "The speed at which the image moves",
                "The auditory component of the cue image",
                "The final desired state image"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Driver Submodality is the 'lever' of the internal representation. Changing it (e.g., brightness or distance) triggers a complete shift in the client's emotional response."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In Strategic Reframing and Parts Integration, what is the fundamental assumption regarding a 'conflicting part'?",
            "options": [
                "The part is a result of a biological malfunction",
                "The part has a positive intent for the individual",
                "The part must be eliminated for the client to heal",
                "The part is always located in the dominant hand"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NLP assumes every part of the person, even those generating 'negative' behaviors, has a positive intention (e.g., protection, safety, or comfort)."

            "options": [
                "To determine the client's past trauma",
                "To test the work and ensure the new resource triggers automatically in the target context",
                "To build rapport through mirroring the future self",
                "To increase the practitioner's billable hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future pacing is a 'mental rehearsal' that links the new resource to the specific environmental triggers the client will face, ensuring the change sticks."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "According to research cited in the Micro-Calibration lesson, micro-expressions typically last for how long?",

                "1 to 2 seconds",
                "1/25th to 1/5th of a second",

                "5 to 10 seconds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-expressions are fleeting, involuntary facial expressions that occur within 1/25th to 1/5th of a second, reflecting true underlying emotions."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "When 'Mapping Across' submodalities from a 'Like' to a 'Dislike' state, what is the first step in the process?",
            "options": [
                "Elicit the submodalities of the state you want to change",
                "Perform a Swish pattern immediately",
                "Break state and test the results",
                "Apply the Milton Model to the desired state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The process begins by eliciting the specific submodalities (size, color, location, etc.) of the current state that is to be modified."
