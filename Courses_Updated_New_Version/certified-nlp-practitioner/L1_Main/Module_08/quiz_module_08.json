            "options": [
                "Context reframing changes the internal representation, while meaning reframing changes the external environment.",
                "Context reframing explores where a behavior is useful, while meaning reframing changes the interpretation of the behavior itself.",
                "Context reframing is used for phobias, while meaning reframing is used for internal conflicts.",
                "There is no functional distinction; both terms are used interchangeably in NLP modeling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Context Reframe asks 'In what other situation would this behavior be appropriate?', while a Meaning Reframe asks 'What else could this behavior mean?' to shift the client's perception."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration cannot occur effectively until both parts recognize they share a high-level positive intent (e.g., safety or happiness), which dissolves the perceived conflict."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Away-From motivation is fueled by the need to avoid pain. As the client moves further from the problem, the pressure decreases, often leading to a loss of momentum."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ecology is the study of consequences. An ecology check asks 'What will happen if you get this?' and 'Is there anyone or anything that might be negatively affected?'"

                "An Auditory Digital internal dialogue.",

            "explanation": "In standard eye patterns (for a right-handed person), up and to the left from the observer's perspective (client's right) is Visual Constructed, but up and to the right from the observer's perspective (client's left) is Visual Remembered. (Note: Standard NLP notation uses the client's left/right)."
