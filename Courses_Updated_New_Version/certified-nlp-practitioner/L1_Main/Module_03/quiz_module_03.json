            "options": [
                "The actual words spoken or written in a sentence.",
                "The full linguistic representation of an experience before deletions, distortions, and generalizations occur.",
                "The specific tone and inflection used during a conversation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Deep Structure is the complete, underlying meaning and linguistic representation of an experience, which is then filtered through universal modeling processes to become the Surface Structure (the spoken word)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'People' is an Unspecified Referential Index because the client has not identified which specific individuals are doing the judging."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is a Cause-Effect distortion. The challenge should address the perceived causal link between an external stimulus and the speaker's internal state."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Challenging Modal Operators of Necessity (e.g., 'What would happen if you didn't?') helps reveal the underlying rules or feared consequences that limit the client's options."

                "To gather specific, granular details about a client's problem.",
                "To challenge the client's limiting beliefs using logic.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Milton Model is the 'inverse' of the Meta-Model; it uses vagueness to bypass the conscious mind's critical filters and allow the client to populate the language with their own positive resources."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phonological ambiguity occurs when words sound the same but have different meanings (e.g., bear/bare, here/hear, write/right), which can be used to distract the conscious mind."

            "explanation": "People with an Internal Frame of Reference use their own internal standards and feelings to evaluate their performance, rather than relying on external feedback."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Meta-Model is used for 'down-chunking' to get specific data and break limitations, while the Milton Model is used for 'up-chunking' to create trance and install new possibilities."
