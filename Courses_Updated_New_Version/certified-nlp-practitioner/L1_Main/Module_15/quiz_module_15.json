            "question": "In the N.E.U.R.O. Mastery Mindset framework (L1), what is the primary objective of the 'Notice' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately correct the client's limiting beliefs",
                "To calibrate the client's baseline physiological and linguistic patterns",
                "To install new submodalities through the SWISH pattern",
                "To perform a context reframe on the client's primary complaint"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Notice' phase is dedicated to advanced calibration, where the practitioner observes the client's baseline state, sensory acuity, and non-verbal cues before intervention."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "When applying the 9-Point Well-Formedness Criteria (L3), why is the 'Ecology' check considered critical for long-term success?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures the goal is stated in positive language",
                "It determines if the client has the financial resources to proceed",
                "It evaluates the consequences of the change on the client's wider life and relationships",
                "It identifies which Meta-Model violations the client is currently using"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ecology checks look at the 'systemic' impact of a change, ensuring that achieving the goal doesn't create unintended negative consequences in other areas of the client's life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "A client states: 'My boss always ignores my suggestions.' According to the Meta-Model (L4), which linguistic violation is present?",
            "options": [

                "Universal Quantifier",

                "Mind Reading"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The word 'always' is a Universal Quantifier, an absolute generalization that excludes exceptions and limits the client's map of reality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "In the 'Dynamic Reframing' lesson (L5), what is the fundamental difference between a Context Reframe and a Meaning Reframe?",
            "options": [
                "Context reframes change the submodalities; Meaning reframes change the outcome",
                "Context reframes change the 'where/when' a behavior is useful; Meaning reframes change 'what' the behavior signifies",
                "Context reframes are Meta-Model based; Meaning reframes are Milton-Model based",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms in the N.E.U.R.O. protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Context Reframe finds a setting where a 'bad' behavior is actually useful, while a Meaning Reframe gives a new, more empowering interpretation to the behavior itself."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "During the SWISH pattern (L6), why is it standard practice to have the 'Desired Self' image be dissociated (seen from a distance)?",
            "options": [
                "To make the image harder to remember",
                "To create a 'propulsion' effect or a 'tug' toward that future state",
                "To prevent the client from feeling the emotions too early",
                "To follow the Meta-Model synthesis guidelines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation in the target image creates a 'pull' toward the goal. If the client were associated, they might feel they have already achieved it, reducing the motivation to change."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Which specific submodality change is most commonly found to be a 'Driver' for most people when using 'Mapping Across' (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "Color vs. Black and White",
                "Location and Size",
                "Auditory volume",
                "Olfactory intensity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While drivers vary by individual, 'Location' and 'Size' are statistically the most common 'driver' submodalities that shift the emotional intensity of a mental representation."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "In the 'Optimize' phase (L7), what is the primary function of Future Pacing?",
            "options": [
                "To charge the client for future sessions",
                "To regress the client to the root cause of the problem",
                "To mentally rehearse the new behavior in future high-stress contexts to ensure automaticity",
                "To use Milton Model language to induce a deep trance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing acts as a 'mental bridge,' ensuring that the new resources and behaviors are available and triggered automatically when the client encounters the relevant context in the future."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "The Milton Model pattern 'I wonder if you'll notice how quickly you can learn this' is an example of what? (L4)",
            "options": [
                "A Simple Selectional Restriction",
                "An Embedded Command and Presupposition",
                "A Negative Paradox",
                "A Meta-Model Challenge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This uses 'I wonder if...' to bypass the conscious mind, 'notice how quickly...' as an embedded command, and presupposes that the person *can* learn it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT one of the 9-Point Well-Formedness Criteria (L3)?",

                "Stated in the Positive",
                "Initiated and Maintained by the Self",
                "Approved by External Stakeholders",
                "Sensory-Based Evidence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The criteria focus on the client's internal control and sensory experience; 'Approved by External Stakeholders' is not a standard NLP Well-Formedness criterion (though it may relate to Ecology)."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "When orchestrating the full N.E.U.R.O. Protocol (L8), when should the practitioner check for 'Incongruence' in the client?",
            "options": [
                "Only during the Optimize phase",
                "Only during the Notice phase",
                "At every stage of the protocol",
                "Only if the SWISH pattern fails"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calibration is continuous. A practitioner must monitor for signs of incongruence (conflicting verbal/non-verbal signals) throughout the entire process to ensure the intervention is ecologically sound."
