            "question": "In the context of NLP Modeling (Lesson 1), what is the primary distinction between 'Simple Imitation' and 'NLP Modeling'?",
            "options": [
                "Imitation focuses on results, while modeling focuses on the emotional state of the practitioner.",
                "Imitation copies external behaviors, while modeling captures the internal syntax, beliefs, and mental maps of the expert.",
                "Modeling requires at least 10,000 hours of practice, whereas imitation is immediate.",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in professional coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NLP Modeling goes beyond surface-level behavior to map the internal representational systems, strategies, and belief structures that produce excellence."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the T.O.T.E. Model (Lesson 2), what occurs during the 'Operate' phase of a behavioral strategy?",
            "options": [
                "The individual compares current data against the desired goal.",
                "The individual exits the strategy because the goal was achieved.",
                "The individual accesses resources and performs actions to decrease the incongruity between the current state and the goal.",
                "The individual establishes the initial trigger for the behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Operate' phase involves the actions, internal processing, or information gathering intended to move closer to the desired outcome identified in the 'Test' phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "When eliciting a strategy (Lesson 3), which question is specifically designed to identify the 'Trigger' (the first T in T.O.T.E.)?",
            "options": [
                "\"How do you know when you are finished?\"",
                "\"What do you do specifically to get the result?\"",
                "\"What was the very first thing that happened that let you know it was time to start?\"",
                "\"What do you say to yourself while you are doing it?\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The trigger is the internal or external stimulus that initiates the strategy sequence. Asking what 'let you know it was time to start' targets this specific point."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client states: \"I am just not a disciplined person; I've always been lazy.\" At which of Dilts’ Logical Levels (Lesson 4) is this problem primarily situated?",
            "options": [
                "Capabilities",
                "Identity",
                "Environment",
                "Beliefs and Values"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Statements beginning with 'I am' typically indicate an Identity-level issue, which is more pervasive and harder to change than a behavior or capability issue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "During Advanced Calibration (Lesson 5), you notice a standard-organized client looking up and to their right (your left). What does this eye accessing pattern typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Visual Remembered (Vr)",
                "Auditory Digital (Ad)",
                "Visual Constructed (Vc)",
                "Kinesthetic (K)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a standardly organized individual, looking up and to their right (the observer's left) indicates Visual Constructed—the process of imagining or creating a new image."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "When designing and installing a new strategy (Lesson 6), what is the purpose of 'Future Pacing'?",
            "options": [
                "To determine if the client has the financial resources to continue coaching.",
                "To mentally rehearse the new strategy in a future context to ensure it triggers automatically.",
                "To look back at past failures and reframe them.",
                "To speed up the client's internal processing of information."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future pacing is a form of mental rehearsal that bridges the gap between the coaching session and real-world application, ensuring the new behavior is linked to the appropriate environmental triggers."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Synesthesia' is described as an interference pattern where:",
            "options": [
                "The client cannot remember their strategy.",
                "Two or more representational systems are so tightly linked that one automatically triggers the other.",
                "The client falls into a loop between 'Test' and 'Exit'.",
                "The client experiences a total lack of sensory input."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synesthesia in NLP refers to a quick, often unconscious link between senses (e.g., 'See-Feel' or 'Hear-Feel'), which can be a driver of both high performance and problematic emotional loops."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the N.E.U.R.O. framework for high-performance coaching (Lesson 8), why is 'Ecology' a critical check?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the coach is being environmentally friendly.",
                "To verify that the proposed change does not have negative unintended consequences for the client or their system.",
                "To check if the client has enough energy (calories) to complete the task.",
                "To measure the electrical output of the brain during the strategy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Ecology Check ensures that the change is beneficial for the person's whole life and relationships, preventing 'buyer's remorse' or self-sabotage later on."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Which of the following represents a 'Strategy Loop' that fails to reach the 'Exit' phase (Lesson 7)?",
            "options": [
                "A person who decides to buy a car and then buys it.",
                "An athlete who visualizes a perfect jump and then executes it.",
                "A perfectionist who constantly re-tests their work against an unattainable standard and never feels it is 'done'.",
                "A student who studies for an exam and then stops once they know the material."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A loop occurs when the 'Test' criteria are never met, leading the individual to repeat the 'Operate' phase indefinitely without ever reaching 'Exit'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "According to the Dilts Pyramid (Lesson 4), a change made at the 'Beliefs and Values' level is likely to:",
            "options": [
                "Only affect the Environment level.",
                "Have no impact on the Identity level.",
                "Radiate downward to influence Capabilities, Behaviors, and Environment.",
                "Be less effective than a change made at the Behavior level."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Logical Levels hierarchy, changes made at higher levels (Identity, Beliefs) naturally flow down and organize the levels below them (Capabilities, Behaviors, Environment)."
