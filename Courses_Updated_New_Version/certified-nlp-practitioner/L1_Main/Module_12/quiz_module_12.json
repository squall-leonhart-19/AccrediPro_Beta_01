            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "During Advanced Sensory Acuity (L1), which physiological shift is most indicative of a client moving from an Internal Kinesthetic (Ki) state to an Internal Visual (Vi) state?",
            "options": [
                "Deepening of the voice and slower speech tempo",
                "Shift to higher, shallower thoracic breathing and upward eye movements",
                "Lowered muscle tone in the facial features and jaw relaxation",
                "A shift to rhythmic, abdominal breathing and downward eye movements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A transition to a visual state typically involves a shift to higher chest breathing, increased speaking rate, and upward eye access, as discussed in the Advanced Sensory Acuity lesson."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In the 'Ecology of Complex Outcomes' (L2), what is the primary purpose of using the Cartesian Quadrants (What would happen if you did/didn't, etc.)?",
            "options": [
                "To build deep rapport through matching and mirroring",
                "To identify hidden secondary gains or systemic objections to the change",
                "To install a positive anchor for future use",
                "To determine if the client is 'In-Time' or 'Through-Time'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cartesian logic is used in ecology checks to uncover unconscious objections and ensure the outcome is safe and beneficial for the client's entire life system."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Which Sleight of Mouth pattern (L3) involves challenging the client's belief by identifying a higher-level value that is more important than the one mentioned in the objection?",

                "Redefine",
                "Counter-Example",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hierarchy of Criteria reframes the objection by focusing on a more significant value, effectively making the original belief or objection seem less important."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When performing 'Chaining Anchors' (L4), what is the specific requirement for the intermediate states chosen between the 'Stuck State' and the 'Goal State'?",
            "options": [
                "They must be as negative as the stuck state to build contrast",
                "They must be purely visual to prevent emotional overwhelm",
                "They must provide a logical and emotional 'bridge' that moves the client incrementally toward the goal",
                "They must be triggered simultaneously with the stuck state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chaining requires a sequence of states (e.g., Frustration -> Curiosity -> Discovery -> Confidence) where each state leads naturally to the next."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'In-Time' orientation typically involves the timeline passing through the body, associated with being fully present in the moment but sometimes having difficulty with long-term planning."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Within the N.E.U.R.O. Framework (L6), the 'E' stage stands for 'Elicit and Establish.' What is the primary focus during this phase?",
            "options": [
                "Ending the session with a handshake",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' phase focuses on uncovering the client's current reality and defining exactly what they want to achieve (the Well-Formed Outcome)."

            "id": "q12_7",

                "Practitioners can treat clinical depression if they use Timeline Integration",
                "Practitioners must refer clients with diagnosed mental health disorders to licensed clinical professionals",
                "Practitioners are authorized to prescribe supplements to aid the NLP process",
                "There are no boundaries as long as the client gives consent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical NLP practice requires recognizing the limits of coaching and referring clients to clinical specialists for mental health disorders or trauma beyond the practitioner's training."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In 'The Complete Session' (L8), what is the purpose of the 'Future Pace' step after an intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To schedule the next paid session",
                "To mentally rehearse the new behavior in a future context to ensure the change holds",
                "To explain the theory of NLP to the client",
                "To induce a deep hypnotic trance for relaxation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future pacing 'wires' the new resource into the client's future timeline, ensuring that when they encounter the old trigger, the new response automatically activates."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client says, 'I can't be a good leader because I am too quiet.' Using the Sleight of Mouth pattern 'Redefine' (L3), which response is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "'So you're saying being quiet makes you a total failure?'",
                "'It's not that you are quiet, it's that you are observant and thoughtful before you speak.'",
                "'When was a time you were loud?'",
                "'Who told you that leaders have to be loud?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Redefining swaps one of the words in the belief (quiet) for a new word with a different, more positive meaning (observant/thoughtful) while maintaining the logic."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "When 'Collapsing Anchors' (L4) to neutralize a negative trigger, what must the practitioner ensure regarding the resource anchor?",
            "options": [
                "It must be weaker than the negative anchor to avoid shock",
                "It must be exactly the same intensity as the negative anchor",
                "It must be significantly more powerful and intense than the negative state",
                "It must be a kinesthetic anchor only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a successful collapse, the positive resource state must 'overwhelm' the negative state neurologically, which requires the resource anchor to be much stronger."
