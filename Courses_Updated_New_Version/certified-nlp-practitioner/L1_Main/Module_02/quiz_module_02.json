            "question": "In the Philosophy of Outcome-Oriented Thinking, what is the primary distinction between a 'Problem Frame' and an 'Outcome Frame'?",
            "options": [
                "The Problem Frame focuses on why something is wrong, while the Outcome Frame focuses on what is wanted and how to get there.",
                "The Problem Frame is used for clinical therapy, while the Outcome Frame is only for business coaching.",
                "The Problem Frame analyzes the future, while the Outcome Frame analyzes the past.",
                "There is no functional difference; they are two names for the same diagnostic process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Outcome Frame shifts the focus from 'Why do I have this problem?' (Problem Frame) to 'What do I want instead?' and 'What resources do I need?'"

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client states: 'I want my husband to stop being so critical of my career choices.' According to the Well-Formedness Conditions, why is this outcome not yet well-formed?",
            "options": [
                "It is too specific and needs to be chunked up.",
                "It is stated negatively ('stop being') and the agency lies with another person.",
                "It lacks a clear timeline for completion.",
                "It does not account for the client's internal VAKOG representations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Well-formed outcomes must be stated in the positive (what you DO want) and must be initiated and maintained by the client (Agency), not dependent on someone else changing."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When establishing Sensory-Specific Evidence (VAKOG), which question best helps a client define their 'Exit' criteria for an outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Why has this been a problem for you in the past?",
                "Who else will be affected by this change?",

                "What is the very first step you need to take?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory-specific evidence requires the client to describe the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic markers that prove the outcome has been reached."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first 'Test' in T.O.T.E. (Test-Operate-Test-Exit) is the comparison between where the client is now and where they want to be."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "During an Ecology Check, a practitioner asks: 'What is the 'Secondary Gain' of your current behavior?' What are they looking for?",
            "options": [
                "The financial benefit the client receives from their job.",
                "The hidden positive intention or benefit the client gets from keeping the 'problem' behavior.",
                "The second most important goal the client wants to achieve.",
                "The negative consequences of failing to reach the outcome."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the benefits (like safety, attention, or relief) that a 'problem' behavior provides, which might cause the client to subconsciously resist change."
        },

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client feels overwhelmed by a goal to 'Start a global consulting empire.' Which NLP technique should the practitioner use to make this outcome more manageable?",
            "options": [
                "Chunking Up to find the higher purpose.",
                "Chunking Down to identify the specific, actionable components and resources.",
                "Changing the VAKOG submodalities of the empire image.",
                "Applying a T.O.T.E. loop to the entire concept simultaneously."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chunking down breaks a large, 'global' goal into smaller, bite-sized pieces that are less overwhelming and easier to plan."

                "What will you see when you get there?",
                "Is this goal worth the effort?",
                "Where, when, and with whom do you want (and NOT want) this outcome?",
                "What resources do you already possess?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Contextual boundaries define the specific environments and situations where the outcome is appropriate, ensuring it doesn't bleed into areas where it might be counter-productive."

                "Exit the process immediately.",
                "Give up on the outcome and try a different goal.",
                "Go back to the 'Operate' phase and vary the flexibility of the behavior/strategy.",
                "Tell the client they are not ready for change."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If the test fails, you return to 'Operate' to try a different approach. Flexibility of behavior is key to finding the operation that eventually triggers the 'Exit' (success)."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Research cited in the module regarding goal specificity (e.g., Locke & Latham) suggests that 'Well-Formed' goals lead to higher performance because:",
            "options": [
                "They are easier to achieve.",
                "They reduce the need for an ecology check.",
                "They direct attention and mobilize effort toward specific sensory targets.",
                "They eliminate the need for the T.O.T.E. loop."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific, well-defined outcomes (sensory targets) focus the brain's processing power and energy more effectively than vague intentions."

                "The client might achieve the goal but destroy their relationships or health in the process.",
                "The session will end too quickly.",
                "The practitioner will not be able to charge a premium fee.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ecology is about the 'system.' Without it, a client might achieve a goal (like working 100 hours a week to get a promotion) that inadvertently causes a collapse in other vital areas of their life."
