            "question": "In the T.O.T.E. model of NLP strategies, what does the 'Exit' phase specifically represent?",
            "options": [
                "The initial trigger that starts the strategy loop",
                "The point where the internal test matches the desired criteria",
                "The behavioral actions taken to change the state",
                "The comparison between the current state and the goal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Exit phase occurs when the 'Test' criteria are met (a match is found), allowing the individual to move on to the next strategy or behavior."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "When eliciting a strategy, which notation correctly identifies an 'Internal Auditory Digital' step followed by a 'Kinesthetic' response?",
            "options": [
                "Ae -> K",
                "Ad -> K",
                "Vi -> Ki",
                "At -> Ke"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In NLP notation, 'Ad' stands for Auditory Digital (internal self-talk), and 'K' stands for Kinesthetic (feeling/sensation)."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Strategy Utilization, what is the most effective way to 'install' a new strategy in a client?",
            "options": [
                "Explaining the logic of the strategy repeatedly",
                "Writing the strategy down on a piece of paper",
                "Rehearsing the sequence through chaining anchors or mental rehearsal",
                "Using a deep trance state without any specific sequence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Installation is best achieved through repetitive mental rehearsal or the use of anchored states to 'bridge' the steps of the new strategy sequence."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "In the Swish Pattern, what is the primary function of the 'Cue Image'?",
            "options": [
                "To represent the desired outcome in high detail",
                "To act as the trigger that currently leads to the unwanted behavior",
                "To provide a resource state for the client",
                "To distract the conscious mind during the process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cue Image is the 'starting point' or the specific visual trigger that, in the past, led the client toward the habit or state they wish to change."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "What is the fundamental 'Ecological' requirement during the Parts Integration (Visual Squash) process?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring both parts agree to disappear completely",
                "Finding the common positive intent of both conflicting parts",
                "Choosing which part is 'right' and discarding the other",
                "Making sure the client is in a standing position"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parts Integration relies on the 'Negotiation Model,' which requires identifying that both parts ultimately want something positive for the individual, allowing them to merge into a unified resource."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "During the 6-Step Reframing process, why is it critical to ask the 'Creative Part' to generate alternatives?",
            "options": [
                "Because the original part may not know how to satisfy its intent differently",
                "To confuse the unconscious mind into submission",
                "To ensure the client remains in a light trance",
                "Because the conscious mind is better at creativity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The part responsible for the behavior often has a fixed 'tool' for its intent; the Creative Part is engaged to provide new, healthier behaviors that satisfy the same positive intent."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "In Modeling Excellence, 'Implicit Modeling' is characterized by which of the following?",

                "Interviewing the subject about their conscious beliefs",
                "Reading books written by the expert",
                "Gathering information through 'second position' without conscious analysis first",
                "Creating a flowchart of the expert's behavior immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Implicit modeling involves stepping into the 'second position' with the model to absorb the experience and patterns unconsciously before attempting to codify them."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of 'Future Pacing' at the end of an NLP intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To predict the client's exact future",
                "To ensure the change generalizes to the appropriate context in the real world",
                "To test if the client can remember the session",
                "To extend the length of the coaching session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing 'virtually' places the client in a future scenario where the old problem would have occurred, ensuring the new resource or strategy triggers automatically."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "If a client's motivation strategy is 'A- (negative auditory) -> K- (negative feeling),' they are likely using which type of motivation?",
            "options": [
                "Towards motivation (Incentive)",
                "Away-from motivation (Propulsion)",
                "Balanced motivation",
                "Visual-based motivation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Negative self-talk (A-) leading to a negative feeling (K-) is the hallmark of 'Away-from' motivation, where the individual moves to avoid pain rather than gain pleasure."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "In the 'Visual Squash' technique, what physical indicator often suggests the parts are ready to integrate?",
            "options": [
                "The client's hands moving closer together involuntarily",
                "The client's eyes closing tightly",
                "A sudden increase in breathing rate",
                "The client forgetting the names of the parts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As the unconscious mind begins to resolve the conflict and recognize the shared intent, the hands (representing the parts) typically move toward each other automatically."
