            "question": "In Advanced Reframing, what is the primary distinction between a 'Context Reframe' and a 'Meaning (Content) Reframe'?",
            "options": [
                "Context reframing changes the internal representation, while meaning reframing changes the external environment.",
                "Context reframing asks 'In what other situation would this behavior be useful?', while meaning reframing asks 'What else could this behavior mean?'",
                "Meaning reframing is used for phobias, while context reframing is used for internal conflict.",
                "Context reframing is a linguistic tool, whereas meaning reframing is a submodality shift."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Context reframing involves finding a setting where a 'problem' behavior is actually an asset. Meaning reframing involves changing the interpretation or intention attributed to the behavior itself."

            "question": "During a Parts Integration (Visual Squash) process, what is the most critical factor for a successful resolution between two conflicting parts?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the client keeps their eyes closed throughout the entire process.",
                "Making sure the physical weight of the hands is perfectly balanced.",
                "Eliciting the highest positive intention of both parts until a common goal is identified.",
                "Determining which part is 'right' and should dominate the other."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parts Integration relies on the 'Highest Positive Intention.' When both parts realize they share a high-level goal (like safety or happiness), the conflict dissolves and integration can occur."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In the T.O.T.E. model of strategy elicitation, what specifically occurs during the 'Exit' phase?",
            "options": [
                "The person begins the behavior for the first time.",
                "The person identifies that the current state does not match the desired state.",
                "The strategy is completed because the internal criteria for success have been met (the 'Test' resulted in a match).",
                "The person experiences a breakdown in the strategy and must start over."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Exit' happens when the 'Test' phase confirms that the desired criteria have been satisfied, signaling the brain to move on to the next strategy or behavior."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A practitioner is eliciting a client's 'Motivation Strategy.' The client states, 'I just see myself succeeding and I feel a rush of energy.' Which representational systems are being used in this sequence?",
            "options": [
                "Auditory Digital (Ad) followed by Kinesthetic (K)",
                "Visual External (Ve) followed by Olfactory (O)",
                "Visual Construct (Vc) or Visual Remembered (Vr) followed by Kinesthetic (K)",
                "Kinesthetic (K) followed by Auditory Internal (Ai)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'See myself' indicates a Visual representation, and 'feel a rush' indicates a Kinesthetic response. This is a V -> K strategy sequence."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "The Core Transformation process, developed by Connirae Andreas, differs from standard Parts Integration primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "It uses hypnosis instead of NLP.",
                "It focuses on changing the past rather than the future.",
                "It leads the client through a chain of intentions to reach an ontological 'Core State' of being (e.g., Peace, Love, or Presence).",
                "It is only used for physical health conditions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Core Transformation is unique because it moves beyond 'positive intentions' to reach 'Core States'—states of being that do not depend on external actions or outcomes."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "When using Perceptual Positions for conflict resolution, what is the specific value of the 'Third Position' (The Observer)?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the client to experience the full emotional impact of the other person's anger.",
                "It provides a detached, objective perspective to gather data and insights without emotional 'noise.'",
                "It is the position where the client 'wins' the argument.",
                "It is used to vent frustrations that couldn't be expressed in the first position."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Third Position (Observer) provides the meta-perspective necessary to see the dynamics of the relationship objectively, which is often where the solution is found."

            "question": "According to the Professional Practitioner Protocol, why is 'Ecology Checking' considered a non-negotiable step in any intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner gets paid on time.",
                "To verify if the change is consistent with the client's overall life system and won't cause unintended negative consequences.",
                "To make the session last longer and provide more value.",
                "To check if the client's physical environment is clean."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ecology checks ensure that the change is 'safe' for the client's life, relationships, and self-identity, preventing self-sabotage or 'rebound' effects."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In Strategy Design, if a client has a 'Buying Strategy' that is too fast (leading to impulse purchases they regret), a practitioner might 'intervene' by:",
            "options": [
                "Telling the client to stop spending money.",
                "Adding a step to the strategy, such as an internal dialogue (Ad) check or a 24-hour delay (Test).",
                "Using a swish pattern to remove the image of the item.",
                "Increasing the brightness of the visual representation of the item."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategy installation/design involves adding, deleting, or reordering steps. Adding a 'Test' step (like a cooling-off period or a criteria check) slows down an impulsive strategy."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Sleight of Mouth' pattern known as 'Redefine'?",
            "options": [
                "Changing a word the client used to another word that has a similar meaning but different implications (e.g., changing 'stubborn' to 'focused').",
                "Asking the client what would happen if they didn't have that problem.",
                "Exaggerating the client's belief until it becomes ridiculous.",
                "Pointing out that the client's belief is also held by many famous people."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Redefining is a linguistic reframe that swaps one part of the client's statement for a word with a more positive or useful connotation while maintaining the basic logic."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client undergoes a successful breakthrough session but expresses doubt that the change will last when they return to their stressful job. Which NLP technique is specifically designed to address this?",
            "options": [
                "The Meta Model",
                "The Milton Model",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing mentally rehearses the new resource or behavior in the specific future context where it is needed, ensuring the 'neural tracks' are laid for generalization."
