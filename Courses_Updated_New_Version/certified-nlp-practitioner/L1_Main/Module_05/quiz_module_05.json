            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Architecture of Integration,' what is the primary objective of the 'O' phase in the NLP change model?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the client's primary representational system",
                "To ensure the new change is robust, ecologically sound, and generalized to the future",
                "To break the client's existing rapport to test their emotional resilience",
                "To establish a baseline for the client's current problem state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Optimize & Integrate' phase focuses on ensuring that the changes made during the intervention are stable, do not cause systemic issues (ecology), and are mentally rehearsed for future application."

        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "When performing an Ecology Check (L3), a practitioner discovers a 'Secondary Gain.' What does this term specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The financial cost the client pays for the coaching session",
                "A hidden positive benefit the client receives from maintaining their old, problematic behavior",
                "The second most important goal the client wants to achieve",
                "The physical sensation associated with a successful anchor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Gain is the positive intention or benefit served by a 'negative' behavior. If this gain isn't addressed or preserved in the new behavior, the intervention is likely to fail."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "According to the Law of Requisite Variety (L5), which individual in a given system will have the most influence or control?",
            "options": [
                "The individual with the most authority or highest rank",
                "The individual who is the most physically dominant",
                "The individual with the greatest range of behavioral responses",
                "The individual who has the most specialized knowledge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety states that in any system, the element with the most flexibility (behavioral variety) will be the controlling element."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "During a 'Visual Squash' (L4) for resolving internal conflict, what is the most critical step before the hands are physically brought together?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client to close their eyes tightly",
                "Eliciting the common positive intention of both conflicting parts",
                "Increasing the volume of the internal dialogue",
                "Ensuring the client is in a deep state of trance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration in the Visual Squash relies on finding a 'higher level' positive intention that both parts share. Once they realize they have the same goal, they can integrate their resources."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "What is the primary function of 'Future Pacing' (L2) in a coaching session?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client remember their childhood experiences",
                "To create a mental bridge that triggers the new resource in a specific future context",
                "To extend the session length to ensure the client feels they received value",
                "To predict the exact date the client will achieve their goal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing is a form of mental rehearsal that 'installs' the new behavior into the client's future timeline, ensuring the new response is available when the trigger occurs in real life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Which testing method from Lesson 7 involves the practitioner intentionally trying to 'provoke' the old state or behavior to see if the intervention holds?",
            "options": [
                "Calibrated Observation",
                "Future Pacing",
                "Provocative Inquiry (or Testing the Intervention)",
                "Circular Questioning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Testing the intervention involves 'trying to break it.' If the practitioner tries to lead the client back into the old state and the client remains in the new resource state, the intervention is considered successful."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In 'Strategic Anchoring' (L6), what is the benefit of 'Stacking Anchors'?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the anchor harder for the client to remember",
                "It combines multiple different resource states into a single trigger for a more powerful response",
                "It allows the practitioner to use the same anchor for multiple different clients",
                "It cancels out the effects of previous negative anchors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stacking anchors involves associating multiple powerful resource states (e.g., confidence, joy, and calm) with a single stimulus, making the resulting state much more robust."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "A client feels a conflict between 'working hard for success' and 'spending time with family.' Which NLP concept from Lesson 4 best describes this?",
            "options": [
                "A Phobic Response",
                "An Incongruence (Simultaneous Incongruence)",
                "A Lack of Rapport",
                "A Semantic Prime"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Incongruence occurs when different parts of a person have different goals or values that seem to conflict, often requiring integration techniques like the Visual Squash."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Client Autonomy.' Why is it important to move from 'Practitioner-led' to 'Client-led' at the end of the session?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce the practitioner's liability",
                "To ensure the client takes ownership of the change and doesn't become dependent on the coach",
                "To allow the practitioner to finish the session early",
                "Because the client is paying for the time and should do the work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For long-term stability, the client must believe the change is their own. Shifting autonomy ensures they have the internal agency to maintain the results without the practitioner's presence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of an 'External Ecology' check?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client how they feel about the change internally",
                "Asking the client how their spouse or colleagues might react to their new behavior",
                "Checking if the client's internal parts are in agreement",
                "Verifying if the client's breathing pattern has changed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "External ecology refers to the consequences of the change on the client's environment, relationships, and career. Internal ecology refers to the client's internal systems/parts."
