            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "A client complains, 'I am too detail-oriented and it slows me down.' You respond, 'That level of precision must make you an incredible asset during a high-stakes audit.' Which type of reframe did you use?",
            "options": [
                "Meaning Reframe",
                "Context Reframe",
                "Submodality Shift",
                "Six-Step Reframe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Context Reframe changes the setting or situation in which a behavior occurs to show how it can be useful in a different environment."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the context of Submodalities, what is the primary difference between an 'Analog' and a 'Digital' submodality?",
            "options": [
                "Analog is auditory; Digital is visual",
                "Analog involves a range (like brightness); Digital is a binary toggle (like associated/dissociated)",
                "Analog is used for the Swish Pattern; Digital is used for Anchoring",
                "Analog is conscious; Digital is unconscious"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Analog submodalities exist on a spectrum or gradient (e.g., volume, size), while Digital submodalities are 'either/or' choices (e.g., color vs. black and white)."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "When performing the Swish Pattern to break a habit like nail-biting, how should the 'Target Image' (the desired future self) be formatted?",
            "options": [
                "Associated (looking through your own eyes)",
                "Dissociated (seeing yourself in the picture)",
                "In black and white only",
                "Smaller than the cue image"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a Swish Pattern, the target image must be dissociated so that the brain is drawn toward the desired state rather than feeling it has already arrived."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "According to the 'T.I.G.E.R.' or standard NLP anchoring principles, what is the optimal time to apply the physical touch (the anchor)?",
            "options": [
                "After the state has completely faded",
                "At the very beginning of the state's rise",
                "Just before the state reaches its peak intensity",
                "Exactly 15 seconds after the peak"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To capture the highest neurological intensity, the anchor should be applied just before the state peaks and released once it begins to plateau or decline."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A practitioner decides to use 'Chaining Anchors' instead of a simple 'Collapse Anchors' technique. What is the most likely reason for this choice?",
            "options": [
                "The client is in a state of 'stuckness' and the gap to the target state is too large for a direct jump",
                "The client has a phobia that requires a fast phobia cure",
                "The practitioner wants to remove a positive anchor by mistake",
                "The target state is a negative emotion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chaining is used when the neurological 'distance' between the current state (e.g., procrastination) and the target state (e.g., high motivation) is too great, requiring intermediate 'bridge' states."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In Sleight of Mouth (Conversational Reframing), the 'Hierarchy of Criteria' pattern works by:",
            "options": [
                "Exaggerating the client's belief to an absurd degree",
                "Finding a more important value or criteria that overrides the current belief",
                "Attacking the client's logic directly",
                "Changing the timeline of the belief"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hierarchy of Criteria re-evaluates the belief by introducing a higher-level value (e.g., 'Isn't your long-term health more important than this temporary comfort?')."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of Step 2 in the Six-Step Reframe ('Communicate with the Part')?",
            "options": [
                "To tell the part to stop the behavior immediately",
                "To identify the negative consequences of the behavior",
                "To establish a reliable signal (involuntary) from the part responsible for the behavior",
                "To visualize the part as a physical object"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Step 2 focuses on establishing a communication bridge, usually via an involuntary signal (like a finger twitch or internal sound), to ensure the practitioner is working with the unconscious part."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "During a 'Visual Squash' (Parts Integration) session, what does the physical movement of bringing the hands together symbolize neurologically?",
            "options": [
                "The destruction of the 'bad' part",
                "The creation of a third, integrated perspective that utilizes the resources of both parts",
                "A simple distraction technique for the conscious mind",
                "The end of the trance state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The movement facilitates the neurological integration of two conflicting parts, allowing their previously opposing energies to merge into a unified, resourceful state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "If a client's 'Driver' submodality for a craving is 'Brightness,' what will happen to the intensity of the craving if the practitioner guides the client to dim the image?",
            "options": [
                "The craving will stay the same",
                "The craving will shift to a different food",
                "The intensity of the craving will decrease significantly",
                "The client will become associated into the craving"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Driver' is a critical submodality that, when changed, causes all other submodalities to shift, resulting in a change in the emotional intensity of the experience."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which NLP principle is the foundation for all reframing techniques?",
            "options": [
                "The Map is not the Territory",
                "Every behavior has a positive intention",
                "People have all the resources they need",
                "Law of Requisite Variety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'Positive Intention' is vital for the Six-Step Reframe, the fundamental concept behind all reframing is that every behavior has a positive intention for the person performing it."
