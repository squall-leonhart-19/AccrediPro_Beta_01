            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory-based observations focus strictly on what can be seen or heard (physiology, movement, tone) without adding meaning or internal state assumptions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client says, 'I can't quite grasp the magnitude of this problem, it feels like a heavy burden.' Which representational system is dominant in this statement?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Words like 'grasp,' 'feels,' 'heavy,' and 'burden' are Kinesthetic predicates, relating to tactile sensations, weight, and physical movement."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cross-over mirroring involves matching one aspect of a client's physiology (like breathing) with a different movement of your own (like tapping a finger or nodding)."

                "By changing their own physiology (e.g., uncrossing legs) and observing if the client follows.",
                "By increasing the volume of their voice to command attention.",
                "By moving directly into the 'Elicit' phase of the N.E.U.R.O. workflow."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leading is verified when the practitioner makes a subtle change in their own behavior or physiology and the client follows that change unconsciously."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-expressions are lightning-fast, involuntary facial expressions that occur within 1/25th to 1/5th of a second, often revealing suppressed emotions."

            "id": "q1_8",

            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to judge the client's personality type.",
                "It establishes the sensory baseline needed to detect shifts during later interventions.",
                "It is the phase where the practitioner explains the NLP model to the client.",
                "It ensures the practitioner remains in an 'Alpha' state throughout the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without a baseline established in the 'Notice' phase, a practitioner cannot accurately measure the effectiveness or 'shifts' caused by interventions in later phases."

                "22% higher client retention rates.",
                "Lower levels of personal stress.",

                "No significant difference in outcomes compared to untrained coaches."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High sensory acuity and behavioral observation skills are directly linked to stronger rapport and higher client retention because the client feels more 'seen' and understood."
