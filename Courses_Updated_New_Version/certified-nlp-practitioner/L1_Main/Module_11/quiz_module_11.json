            "question": "During micro-calibration (Lesson 1), which physiological shift is considered a primary indicator of an internal state change?",
            "options": [
                "The client's choice of clothing and accessories",
                "Subtle changes in skin color, lower lip size, and breathing rhythm",
                "The speed at which the client speaks during the session",
                "The client's ability to recall specific dates from their childhood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-calibration focuses on involuntary physiological markers such as skin vasodilation (color), muscle tension (lip size), and autonomic nervous system shifts (breathing)."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In Advanced Outcome Engineering (Lesson 2), the 'Self-Initiated and Maintained' criterion ensures that:",
            "options": [
                "The goal is large enough to be meaningful to the client's family",
                "The goal is dependent on the actions of others to be successful",
                "The client is not relying on external factors or other people to achieve the outcome",
                "The practitioner takes full responsibility for the client's success"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A well-formed outcome must be within the client's control; if the goal requires someone else to change, it is not well-formed in NLP terms."
        },

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client says, 'I have to be perfect all the time.' According to the Meta-Model (Lesson 3), which linguistic pattern is being used?",
            "options": [
                "Modal Operator of Necessity",
                "Universal Quantifier",
                "Nominalization",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "'I have to' is a Modal Operator of Necessity. The practitioner would challenge this by asking, 'What would happen if you weren't?'"

        {
            "id": "q11_4",

                "A Selectional Restriction Violation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'Becoming more relaxed' is the command embedded within a softer, permissive sentence structure designed to bypass the critical factor."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When working with Submodalities (Lesson 5), a 'Critical Driver' (or Lead Submodality) is defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The submodality that the client dislikes the most",
                "The submodality that, when changed, causes all other submodalities to shift",
                "The auditory component of a visual memory",
                "The speed at which a client processes information"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Critical drivers are the specific submodalities (like brightness or location) that hold the most 'leverage' over the internal representation and the resulting emotion."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "To successfully 'install' a kinesthetic anchor (Lesson 6), what is the optimal timing for applying the stimulus?",
            "options": [
                "After the state has completely subsided to ensure it is 'locked in'",
                "At the very beginning of the state when the client is still neutral",
                "Just before the state reaches its peak intensity",
                "Exactly 30 seconds after the client closes their eyes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anchors must be applied as the state is rising and released right at the peak to ensure the strongest association between the stimulus and the peak intensity."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "During a Parts Integration process (Lesson 7), what is the primary purpose of 'chunking up' to find the positive intent of both conflicting parts?",
            "options": [
                "To prove to the client that their behavior is illogical",
                "To find a common higher-level goal where both parts can agree and collaborate",
                "To distract the conscious mind while the unconscious mind works",
                "To determine which part is 'stronger' and should win the conflict"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chunking up allows the practitioner to find a 'Common Higher Intent,' which facilitates the integration of the two formerly conflicting parts."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "An 'Ecology Check' (Lesson 8) is performed to ensure that the proposed change:",
            "options": [
                "Is consistent with the client's budget and schedule",
                "Does not have unforeseen negative consequences for the client or their environment",
                "Will be permanent and never require further intervention",
                "Is scientifically proven by at least three peer-reviewed studies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ecology is the study of consequences. An ecology check asks 'What will you lose if you get this?' or 'How will this affect your family/career?'"

            "id": "q11_9",

            "options": [
                "A picture of the client's desired future self",
                "An associated, 'big and bright' image of the trigger that starts the unwanted behavior",
                "A black and white image of a peaceful beach",
                "A dissociated image of the client failing at their goal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cue Picture is the 'trigger' image (associated) that currently leads to the old behavior, which is then 'swished' into the new, dissociated desired-self image."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "If a client presents with an internal conflict where one part wants to work hard and the other wants to relax, the NLP practitioner's first assumption should be:",
            "options": [
                "The client has a lack of willpower",
                "Both parts have a positive intent for the client",
                "One part is a 'saboteur' and must be eliminated",
                "The client needs to choose one part and ignore the other"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A core presupposition of NLP and the Parts Integration model is that every behavior (and every 'part') has a positive intent for the individual."
