            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Pre-Session Diagnostic' in the AccrediPro Advanced Intake Design?",
            "options": [
                "To predict the exact date of the client's next major financial gain",
                "To establish the client's 'Astrological Literacy' and calibrate the session's technical depth to their specific needs",
                "To determine if the client is 'worthy' of a professional reading based on their sun sign",
                "To replace the actual reading with a standardized automated report"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pre-Session Diagnostic is designed to assess the client's level of understanding and specific intent, allowing the practitioner to provide a tailored, professional experience."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In Quantitative Elemental Assessment models, which weighting is typically assigned to the 'Big Three' (Sun, Moon, Ascendant) compared to outer planets?",
            "options": [
                "They are weighted equally (1 point each)",
                "The Sun and Moon receive 3 points, the Ascendant 2 points, and outer planets 1 point",
                "Outer planets are weighted higher because they represent collective shifts",
                "The Ascendant is the only point that receives a numerical score"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional models weight the personal luminaries and the Ascendant more heavily (usually 2-3 points) to reflect their dominant influence on the individual's temperament."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "The Aspect Friction Index (AFI) identifies a 'High Friction' chart primarily by calculating:",
            "options": [
                "The number of planets in retrograde motion",
                "The ratio of soft aspects (trines/sextiles) to the total number of houses",
                "The total volume of hard aspects (conjunctions, squares, oppositions) weighted by the tightness of their orbs",
                "The distance between the Midheaven and the North Node"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AFI measures the 'internal tension' of a chart by quantifying hard aspects; tighter orbs increase the friction score, indicating more significant psychological or situational challenges."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "According to the Transit Priority Matrix, which of the following would be classified as a 'Tier 1' (High Priority) event?",

                "Transiting Mercury retrograde in a cadent house"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tier 1 transits involve outer planets (Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn) making hard aspects to personal angles or luminaries, as these represent major life-altering cycles."

            "id": "q20_5",

            "options": [
                "When three planets are in the same zodiacal decan",
                "When a planet or sensitive point falls on the arithmetic center between two other planets within a narrow orb (usually <1.5°)",
                "When the Sun and Moon are in a balsamic phase",
                "When a chart has an equal number of planets above and below the horizon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A midpoint picture (A=B/C) occurs when a planet (A) occupies the mathematical midpoint of two other planets (B and C), creating a synthesis of their energies."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "When performing Relational Assessment, what is the fundamental conceptual difference between Synastry and a Composite Chart?",
            "options": [
                "Synastry is for family members; Composite is for romantic partners",
                "Synastry maps how two people interact; the Composite Chart maps the relationship itself as a third, independent entity",
                "Synastry uses the midpoint of the two birth dates; Composite uses the actual birth times",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same technique"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synastry (overlay) shows the chemistry and triggers between two people, while the Composite (midpoint) chart describes the 'life' and purpose of the relationship as a unit."

                "Highlighting a deficiency in the Water element and suggesting emotional regulation techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Astrologers must never provide medical, legal, or psychological diagnoses. Saturn in Taurus may suggest a 'tendency,' but a diagnosis is a breach of professional ethics and scope."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Quantitative Void' in the Air element (0 points) but a surplus in Water (9 points). This assessment suggests:",
            "options": [
                "The client is highly intellectual but lacks empathy",
                "A potential struggle with objective perspective and a tendency to be overwhelmed by subjective emotional states",
                "The client will likely work in a field related to aviation or telecommunications",
                "The birth time is likely incorrect because everyone must have Air"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elemental voids indicate a lack of natural 'wiring' for that element's function; an Air void combined with high Water suggests difficulty detaching from emotions to achieve mental clarity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 90-degree dial is a precision tool that allows practitioners to see all 'hard' family aspects and midpoints at a glance, which are the primary focus of Uranian/Cosmobiology assessment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional ethics require astrologers to recognize the limits of their training and refer clients to mental health professionals when clinical distress is evident."
