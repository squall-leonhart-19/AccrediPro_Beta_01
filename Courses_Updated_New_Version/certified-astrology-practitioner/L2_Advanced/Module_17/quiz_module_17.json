            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "In a T-Square configuration, which planet represents the primary outlet for the tension and is often where the client feels the most pressure to act?",
            "options": [
                "The Focal (Apex) Planet",
                "The Planet in the 1st House",
                "The Chart Ruler",
                "The planet with the highest declination"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Focal or Apex planet in a T-Square receives the square aspects from both ends of the opposition, acting as the 'pressure cooker' and the primary driver for resolution and action."

        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "When a sign is intercepted within a house (meaning it does not appear on any house cusp), which factor is considered the 'key' to unlocking that sign's hidden potential?",

                "The North Node's position",
                "The planetary ruler of the intercepted sign",
                "The planet conjunct the Midheaven",
                "The asteroid Chiron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The planetary ruler of the intercepted sign (and its condition by sign, house, and aspect) acts as the 'key' that the client must develop to access the 'locked' qualities of the intercepted sign."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "The 'Mid-Life Cycle' (ages 37-45) involves a specific sequence of high-stakes transits. Which of the following is NOT typically part of this specific developmental window?",

                "Neptune square Neptune",

                "Saturn return"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Saturn Return occurs at approximately ages 29 and 58. The mid-life cycle is specifically characterized by the Pluto square, Neptune square, and Uranus opposition."

            "options": [
                "Two planets in the 12th house, indicating secrets",
                "An aspect that repeats in both directions (e.g., Person A's Mars square Person B's Saturn AND Person B's Mars square Person A's Saturn)",
                "When both partners have the same Rising sign",
                "When both partners have a Void of Course Moon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Double Whammy occurs when an aspect is exchanged between both charts. It significantly intensifies the theme (e.g., power struggles or attraction) because both individuals are playing both roles in the dynamic."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Vocational Crisis' featuring a 10th House Sun (ambition) and a 12th House Moon (need for solitude). What is the most integrative practitioner advice?",

                "Advise them to ignore the Moon's needs to achieve career success",
                "Suggest they quit their job to live in a monastery",
                "Suggest a career that involves 'behind-the-scenes' leadership, institutional work, or healing arts",
                "Tell them their chart is too contradictory for a stable career"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration is key in vocational astrology. Combining the 10th House (public status) with the 12th House (seclusion/healing) suggests a high-level role in a private or institutional setting."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Practice, when a practitioner observes a prominent Pluto/Chiron contact, what is the primary ethical responsibility?",

                "To diagnose the client with a specific psychological disorder",
                "To force the client to disclose the details of their trauma immediately",
                "To hold a safe container, use non-deterministic language, and focus on the client's agency and resilience",
                "To tell the client they will never be able to move past their 'wound'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed practitioners prioritize safety, agency, and empowerment, avoiding 'retraumatization' by not forcing disclosures and focusing on the archetypal potential for healing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An Earth void often manifests as a struggle with the material world, such as managing finances, maintaining routines, or feeling 'at home' in the physical body."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "According to Ethical Mastery standards, how should a practitioner handle a client's request for a 'fatalistic' prediction about a death or accident?",
            "options": [
                "Provide the date and time of the event if the chart shows it",
                "Refuse the request and explain the ethical boundary regarding the limits of prediction and the importance of free will",
                "Make up a positive prediction to avoid upsetting them",
                "Charge a 'hazard fee' for the prediction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practitioners maintain strict boundaries regarding fatalistic predictions, focusing instead on the psychological and developmental themes indicated by transits."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A Grand Cross configuration in a natal chart typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "A life of ease and lack of significant challenge",
                "A feeling of being pulled in four different directions, requiring the client to develop high levels of integration and persistence",
                "That the client will become famous before age 30",
                "A total lack of planetary energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Grand Cross creates immense internal and external pressure. While challenging, it often produces individuals of great strength and accomplishment because they are 'forced' to integrate diverse parts of their personality."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "When signs are intercepted, the 'Duplicated Signs' (the signs that appear on two consecutive house cusps) represent:",
            "options": [
                "Areas where the client feels 'blocked' or invisible",
                "Areas of life where the client has an abundance of environmental support or where energy flows more easily",
                "The client's primary source of trauma",
                "Planets that are 'combust' the Sun"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Duplicated signs are the compensatory mechanism for interceptions. They represent areas of life that are 'double-emphasized' and often provide the resources needed to solve the problems of the intercepted houses."
