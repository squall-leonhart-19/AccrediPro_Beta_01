            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' in the ASPECT method stands for Synthesis, which is the art of moving beyond a 'cookbook' list of placements to create a holistic narrative of the client's life."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mutual Reception occurs when two planets are in each other's signs of rulership, creating a 'back-door' connection that allows them to assist one another."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'C' Factor (Conversion) looks for the high-vibration expression of a challenge; a Mercury-Saturn square can become the mark of a master researcher or editor."
