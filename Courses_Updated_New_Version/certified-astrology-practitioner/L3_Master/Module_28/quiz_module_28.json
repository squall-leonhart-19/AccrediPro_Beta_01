            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Astrological Practice, what does the term 'Window of Tolerance' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The specific time frame during a Pluto transit when a client is most receptive to change.",
                "The zone of arousal where a client can process information and emotions without becoming overwhelmed or shut down.",
                "The maximum number of minutes an astrologer should spend discussing difficult natal aspects.",
                "The period of time between a traumatic event and the first astrological consultation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is a concept used in trauma-informed care to describe the state where a person is able to function and process emotions effectively. Practitioners must ensure clients stay within this window to avoid re-traumatization."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A client is experiencing a 'Perfect Storm' synthesis involving a Pluto square to the natal Sun and a Saturn Return. According to Lesson 6, what is the primary goal of the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "To predict the exact date the crisis will end to provide hope.",
                "To encourage the client to ignore the Saturnian demands and focus only on Plutonian rebirth.",
                "To help the client distinguish between what needs to be structurally reinforced (Saturn) and what must be fundamentally released (Pluto).",
                "To suggest the client take an immediate leave of absence from all responsibilities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex synthesis, the practitioner must help the client navigate conflicting planetary energies—Saturn requires building and responsibility, while Pluto requires purging and transformation."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Which physiological system is most directly impacted during a major Uranus transit, requiring the practitioner to suggest 'grounding' techniques?",
            "options": [
                "The Digestive System",
                "The Nervous System",
                "The Endocrine System",
                "The Circulatory System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Uranus is associated with the nervous system and electrical impulses. Sudden disruptions often lead to 'hyper-arousal' or a 'fried' nervous system, making grounding essential for the 'Art of the Pivot.'"

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on Ethics and Boundaries, which of the following is a 'Hard Red Flag' that requires an immediate referral to a licensed mental health professional?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety is the absolute boundary. Intent to harm or active psychosis are outside the scope of astrological practice and require immediate professional clinical intervention."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "Neptune transits are often characterized by 'dissolution.' What is a common risk when a client experiences Neptune crossing their Ascendant?",

                "Sudden financial windfall followed by immediate loss.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neptune on the Ascendant often dissolves the ego-boundaries, leading to confusion about the self and a tendency to use spirituality to avoid dealing with earthly realities (spiritual bypassing)."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In the context of Saturn’s Weight (Lesson 5), how does 'Astrological Despair' differ from clinical depression in a practitioner's assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Astrological despair is only felt by people with Capricorn placements.",
                "It is a temporary state of 'contraction' linked to specific developmental milestones, though it can trigger or mimic clinical depression.",
                "Astrological despair lasts exactly 2.5 years, whereas clinical depression lasts forever.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable in professional practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While they can overlap, Saturnian contraction is often a developmental pressure cooker meant to build character and resilience. Practitioners must be careful not to diagnose but to recognize the 'weight' as a transit-related pressure."

                "Sudden mastery of the client's natal chart without looking at it.",
                "Physical symptoms like improved digestion and increased sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary trauma (or vicarious trauma) occurs when the practitioner absorbs the distress of their clients, leading to burnout, compassion fatigue, and emotional withdrawal."

            "id": "q28_8",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Pluto cycle typically follows: Loss/Catharsis, The Void/Incubation, and finally Integration/Rebirth. The practitioner helps the client find meaning in the 'rebirth' phase."

            "options": [
                "Used more technical jargon during the session.",
                "Clearly defined the scope of practice and established firm boundaries early on.",
                "Extended the session time to over two hours.",
                "Avoided mentioning difficult transits entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clarity of scope and firm boundaries create a 'containment field' that allows the client to feel safe, which significantly improves the perceived value and psychological outcome of the session."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "Which 'Pivot Strategy' is most effective for a client facing a sudden Uranus-driven job loss?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging them to wait for the transit to pass before taking any action.",
                "Identifying the 'latent' Uranian talent or desire for freedom that the job was previously suppressing.",
                "Suggesting they take a loan to maintain their current lifestyle.",
                "Focusing on the Saturnian reasons why they failed at the job."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Uranus transits often 'liberate' us from situations that were stifling our growth. The 'Art of the Pivot' involves finding the hidden opportunity for authenticity within the disruption."
