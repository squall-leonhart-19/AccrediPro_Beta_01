            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to the 'Alchemy of Temperament' (Lesson 1), which classical temperament corresponds to the Fire element and the qualities of Hot and Dry?",
            "options": ["Sanguine", "Choleric", "Melancholic", "Phlegmatic"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Choleric temperament is associated with the Fire element, characterized by the qualities of Hot and Dry, representing heat, activity, and tension."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the Weighted Point System (Lesson 6), why are the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant typically assigned 4 points each while outer planets receive only 1?",
            "options": ["Because outer planets have no impact on temperament", "To reflect the 'Big Three's' dominant role in the immediate psychological structure", "Because inner planets move faster through the zodiac", "To simplify the math for the practitioner"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sun, Moon, and Ascendant are the 'Luminaries' and the 'Physical Lens' of the chart; they carry more weight (4 points) because they represent the core of the individual's conscious and subconscious temperament."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client with an 'Earth Deficiency' (Lesson 3) is most likely to struggle with which of the following practical challenges?",
            "options": ["Lack of emotional depth and empathy", "Difficulty with abstract thinking and social networking", "Trouble with follow-through, administrative tasks, and physical grounding", "A lack of motivation and creative inspiration"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Earth provides the foundation of form and pragmatism. A deficiency often manifests as a struggle with the material world, such as managing finances, maintaining a routine, or finishing projects."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which element is described in Lesson 4 as the 'Breath of Intellect,' functioning as the bridge between the self and the collective through social exchange?",
            "options": ["Fire", "Earth", "Air", "Water"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Air represents the intellectual and social realms, focusing on communication, conceptualization, and the exchange of ideas between people."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, Water's intuitive processing is described as 'non-linear.' What is the primary shadow expression of an over-emphasized Water element?",
            "options": ["Hyper-rationalism and coldness", "Emotional volatility and becoming 'lost' in the subjective sea", "Reckless impulsivity and burnout", "Rigid materialism and stubbornness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Over-emphasized Water can lead to emotional flooding, where the individual loses objectivity and becomes overwhelmed by their own or others' emotions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Modes.' If a client has high Fire but it is primarily in the 'Fixed' mode (Leo), how will their energy manifest compared to 'Cardinal' Fire (Aries)?",
            "options": ["The energy will be more scattered and inconsistent", "The energy will be more sustained, concentrated, and resistant to change", "The energy will be purely intellectual rather than physical", "The energy will be suppressed and never expressed"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fixed modes stabilize energy. While Cardinal Fire (Aries) is a sudden burst, Fixed Fire (Leo) is a sustained glow, providing more endurance but also more potential for stubbornness."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "When applying 'Elemental Remediation' (Lesson 8), which strategy is recommended for a client with a 'Water Deficiency' to help them access their emotions?",
            "options": ["Engaging in high-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Structured logic puzzles and debating", "Journaling, spending time near bodies of water, and 'intentional vulnerability' exercises", "Strict financial budgeting and physical labor"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To remediate a Water deficiency, the practitioner suggests activities that encourage emotional flow and receptivity, such as being near water or practicing vulnerability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "According to the Quantitative Analysis in Lesson 6, what is the significance of a 'Singularity' (a single planet in an element)?",
            "options": ["The element is considered completely balanced", "The single planet acts as a high-pressure outlet, often making that element's expression erratic or intense", "The planet's influence is completely negated by the other elements", "It indicates the client will never experience the qualities of that element"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Singularity' occurs when only one planet occupies an element. This planet often carries the entire weight of that element’s expression, leading to an 'all-or-nothing' or pressurized manifestation."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Fire: The Spark of Vitality' (Lesson 2), what is the Jungian psychological function associated with Fire?",
            "options": ["Sensation", "Thinking", "Feeling", "Intuition"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In Jungian typology, Fire corresponds to 'Intuition'—the ability to perceive future possibilities and the 'spirit' of a situation rather than just its material facts."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A practitioner evaluates a chart with 14 points in Earth and 2 points in Air. Using the synthesis methods from Lesson 7 and 8, what is the most likely coaching focus?",
            "options": ["Helping the client become more realistic and grounded", "Encouraging the client to stop over-analyzing and start feeling", "Helping the client move from 'stagnant pragmatism' toward 'intellectual objectivity' and fresh perspectives", "Advising the client to pursue more physical exercise to burn off excess energy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high-Earth/low-Air profile suggests someone who is very practical but may be stuck in their ways or 'too close' to the material. Remediation focuses on introducing Air qualities like objectivity and new ideas."
