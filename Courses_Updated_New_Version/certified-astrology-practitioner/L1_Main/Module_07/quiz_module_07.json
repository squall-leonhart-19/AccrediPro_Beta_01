            "options": [
                "To provide a purely predictive timeline for future events",
                "A structured 6-step methodology for holistic chart synthesis that bridges technical analysis with actionable client roadmaps",
                "A system designed exclusively for calculating the mathematical precision of house cusps",
                "A method for determining astrological compatibility between business partners only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ASPECT Framework™ is a comprehensive methodology designed to move the practitioner from raw data (A) to synthesis (S, E) and finally to practical, converted actions (C, T)."

            "question": "In the 'A' (Advanced Natal Blueprint Analysis) phase, why is the 'Chart Ruler' (ruler of the Ascendant) given priority?",
            "options": [
                "It represents the client's shadow self that they hide from the world",
                "It is the only planet that determines the client's physical health",
                "It acts as the 'Captain of the Ship,' showing how the individual directs their energy to navigate their life path",
                "It is only significant if it is placed in the First House"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Chart Ruler is the primary 'actor' in the chart, representing the steering mechanism and the primary mode of engagement with the world."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to the principles of Essential Dignity (L3), what does a planet in 'Detriment' signify in a client's life?",
            "options": [
                "A complete lack of talent or ability in that area of life",
                "A planet operating in a 'foreign' environment where its natural expression is challenged, requiring creative or non-traditional approaches",
                "A state of maximum power where the planet can do whatever it wants",
                "A placement that only becomes active after the second Saturn Return"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Detriment (the sign opposite the planet's domicile) suggests a planet must work outside its comfort zone, often leading to unique, highly individualized expressions of that archetype."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A 'Grand Trine' involves three planets in the same element. What is the primary 'shadow side' of this pattern that a practitioner must address?",
            "options": [
                "Extreme volatility and frequent life crises",
                "A tendency toward inertia or a 'closed-loop' where talent is present but the motivation to apply it is lacking",
                "Constant external conflict with authority figures",
                "The inability to form stable long-term relationships"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the Grand Trine represents ease and talent, its 'closed circuit' nature can lead to complacency or lack of drive because the energy flows so smoothly it doesn't encounter the friction needed for growth."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "During the 'S' (Synthesizing Archetypal Themes) phase, what is the practitioner's goal when encountering a 'Steely' Saturn and a 'Fluid' Neptune in a tight square?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the client that these two energies cancel each other out",
                "Focus only on Saturn to provide the client with more structure",

                "Tell the client that this placement makes professional success impossible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is about finding the integration point (the Golden Thread) between seemingly contradictory archetypes to create a unified narrative."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In the 'E' (Evaluating Elemental and Modality Balance) phase, a client with a 'Fixed' modality dominance and zero 'Fire' element is most likely to exhibit which behavior?",

                "Frequent, impulsive changes in career and residence",
                "Extreme emotional sensitivity and lack of boundaries",
                "High endurance and persistence, but extreme difficulty initiating new projects or taking 'leaps of faith'",
                "A scattered communication style that lacks depth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fixed dominance provides endurance, but a lack of Fire indicates a lack of 'spark' or initiative, making the client prone to staying in ruts or over-analyzing before acting."

            "id": "q7_7",

            "options": [
                "As an 'unlucky' placement that causes constant accidents",
                "As the 'Master Architect' energy: the ability to apply immense drive (Mars) through rigorous discipline and strategy (Saturn)",
                "As a sign that the client should avoid all forms of competition",
                "As a placement that requires the client to work twice as hard for half the results"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing turns the 'malefic' tension into a functional skill; Mars-Saturn is the hallmark of controlled power and strategic endurance."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "What is the specific purpose of the 'Strategic Roadmap' in the 'T' (Targeting Aligned Actions) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To provide the client with a list of historical figures who share their chart",
                "To translate the psychological synthesis into 3-5 concrete, time-bound actions the client can take immediately",
                "To calculate the exact date of the client's death",
                "To convince the client to book a follow-up session every week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'T' phase is about implementation. A roadmap ensures the astrological insights result in real-world change through specific, aligned actions."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "When evaluating 'Planetary Power Dynamics' (L3), a planet in 'Mutual Reception' is significant because:",
            "options": [
                "It means the two planets are in a permanent state of war",
                "The planets act as 'guests' in each other's homes, allowing them to cooperate and support one another despite being in different signs",
                "It automatically makes the client wealthy",
                "It cancels out any challenging aspects between those two planets"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mutual Reception (e.g., Venus in Aries and Mars in Libra) creates a supportive link where each planet has an interest in the other's success, facilitating cooperation."

        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "The 'Yod' pattern (L4), often called the 'Finger of God,' is composed of which aspects?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Yod consists of two planets in sextile, both forming a quincunx to a third 'apex' planet, creating a sense of fated redirection and the need for constant adjustment."
