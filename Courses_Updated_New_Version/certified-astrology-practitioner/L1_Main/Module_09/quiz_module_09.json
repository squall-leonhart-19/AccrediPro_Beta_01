            "question": "In the study of Essential Dignities (L1), a planet located in the sign opposite its Domicile is considered to be in 'Detriment.' What is the primary functional expression of a planet in this state?",
            "options": [
                "The planet operates with maximum efficiency and ease.",
                "The planet's energy is 'exalted' and performs better than usual.",
                "The planet feels 'out of place' and must work harder or use unconventional methods to achieve its goals.",
                "The planet is completely dormant and has no effect on the native's life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A planet in Detriment (Exile) is in a sign that does not support its natural archetypal expression, requiring the individual to find creative or non-traditional ways to manifest that planet's energy."

                "The planet that is not involved in any squares.",
                "The planet that receives two square aspects from the planets in opposition.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a T-Square, the Apex planet is the one receiving the two squares. It represents the focal point where the tension of the opposition is channeled and must be integrated."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transmutation involves shifting the 'lead' of a challenging aspect into 'gold' by using the inherent tension of a Square to drive achievement, discipline, and growth."

                "It guarantees that the business will face legal lawsuits within the first year."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Void-of-Course Moon occurs when the Moon makes no more major aspects before changing signs. Traditionally, actions started during this time lack the 'momentum' to produce a lasting or significant result."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first Saturn Return (approx. age 28-30) is a 'rite of passage' into true adulthood, requiring the native to build solid foundations, accept responsibility, and eliminate what no longer serves their long-term growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mutual Reception occurs when two planets reside in the sign that the other rules. This creates a supportive link where the two planets can 'exchange' energy and help each other function more effectively, even if they are in Detriment."
