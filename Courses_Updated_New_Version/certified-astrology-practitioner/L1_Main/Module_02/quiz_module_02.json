            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the art of combining individual placements into a unified whole, moving beyond isolated definitions to find the 'red thread' or central narrative of the chart."

                "Sun is the past, Moon is the present, Ascendant is the future.",

                "They are all of equal importance and should never be weighted differently."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Core Triad synthesis views the Ascendant as the personality's filter/mask, the Sun as the central solar purpose/identity, and the Moon as the underlying emotional requirements for safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The sign describes the qualities or 'costume' the planet wears, while the house describes the specific area of life or 'stage' where that energy is most active."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Final Dispositor is a planet in its own sign that terminates a chain of command, meaning all other planets in that chain eventually report to its archetypal authority."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Stellium (3+ planets) creates a 'weight' in the chart that often overrides other factors, making that sign or house an archetypal dominant in the client's life."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Signature Sign is a calculation of the dominant Element (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and Modality (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) to find the 'background frequency' of the chart."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A T-Square consists of an opposition and two squares, creating high tension that is released through the 'focal' or 'apex' planet."

            "explanation": "A Yod involves two planets in a sextile, both forming quincunxes (150 degrees) to a third focal planet, often indicating a 'fated' or highly specific life adjustment."

            "options": [
                "The calculation is wrong and should be ignored.",
                "The client has a 'Shadow Taurus' temperament, possessing Taurean qualities despite lacking Taurus placements.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Signature Sign can reveal a temperament (like Fixed Earth/Taurus) that describes the client's overall 'vibe' even if they have no actual planets in that specific sign."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative Integration is the final step where technical synthesis is translated into a professional, human-centered story that the client can actually use for personal growth."
