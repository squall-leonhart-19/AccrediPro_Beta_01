            "question": "In Advanced Elemental Weighting, if a chart shows a complete 'Void' in the Water element, how does 'Compensation' typically manifest in the native's behavior?",
            "options": [
                "The native becomes emotionally detached and robotic in all circumstances.",
                "The native may over-identify with emotionality, becoming hyper-sensitive or obsessively seeking emotional depth.",
                "The native will naturally gravitate toward Fire signs to replace the missing warmth.",
                "The native will lose the ability to process logic and focus entirely on physical Earth matters."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compensation occurs when a native over-functions in an area where they lack elemental weight. A 'Water Void' often results in an individual who is obsessed with 'feeling' or psychology to prove they are not emotionally deficient."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Stellium represents a massive concentration of power and focus. This often leads to a specialist-type personality where the native's life revolves heavily around the themes of that specific sign or house."
