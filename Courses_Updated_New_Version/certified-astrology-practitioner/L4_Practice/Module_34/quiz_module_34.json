            "question": "When analyzing the 'Group Soul' in a professional setting, what does the Composite Chart of the group members primarily represent?",
            "options": [
                "The mathematical average of the participants' individual natal strengths",
                "The third entity or collective identity created by the group's interaction",
                "A prediction of the financial success of the workshop",
                "The synastry between the facilitator and the most dominant participant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In group dynamics, the Composite Chart represents the 'third entity'—the unique collective identity and purpose that emerges when these specific individuals gather, distinct from their individual natal charts."

            "question": "A facilitator notices the group is highly talkative and intellectual but lacks 'follow-through' and practical application. According to Elemental Balancing (L4), which elemental deficiency is likely present?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Earth provides the grounding, structure, and 'follow-through' necessary to turn ideas into reality. A group high in Air but low in Earth will struggle with practical application."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shadow work requires bringing the unconscious to light. Naming the projection helps the group realize they are 'disowning' a part of their collective experience and placing it on an individual."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "To maintain the integrity of the group container and avoid power imbalances, it is best practice to wait until the group program has concluded before entering a different professional relationship."

                "Deep emotional healing and constant crying among participants",
                "A fast-paced, intellectual exchange with no clear focus"
