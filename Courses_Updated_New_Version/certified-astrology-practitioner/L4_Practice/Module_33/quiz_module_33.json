            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Astrology practitioners are not licensed medical or mental health professionals. Diagnosing a clinical condition (like Clinical Depression) is a restricted activity reserved for licensed healthcare providers and violates the practitioner's scope of practice."

                "It exempts the practitioner from paying income tax on services",
                "It serves as a 'safe harbor' to mitigate claims of deceptive trade practices or fortune-telling bans",
                "It prevents the client from ever being able to file a lawsuit for any reason",
                "It automatically grants the practitioner intellectual property rights over the reading"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While its effectiveness varies by jurisdiction, this disclaimer is used to clarify that the service is not a professional 'expert' prediction of fact, helping to navigate legacy fortune-telling laws and consumer protection standards regarding 'guaranteed' outcomes."

            "explanation": "Birth data (time, date, and location) associated with an identifiable individual is considered Personal Data (PII) under GDPR. Practitioners must have a legal basis (usually explicit consent) to collect and store it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Limitation of Liability clause is a critical risk management tool that limits the practitioner's financial exposure by capping potential damages, often to the amount the client paid for the service."

            "question": "A practitioner advertises '100% Accuracy in Financial Predictions' on social media. Why is this considered an ethical and legal risk under FTC (Federal Trade Commission) standards?",
            "options": [
                "Because accuracy in astrology cannot be scientifically proven",
                "Because it constitutes an 'unsubstantiated claim' and creates an implied warranty of results",
                "Because financial advice requires a Series 7 license in all 50 states",
                "Because the practitioner did not use the proper astrological font in the ad"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FTC and similar consumer protection agencies prohibit 'unfair or deceptive acts.' Claiming 100% accuracy is an unsubstantiated claim that creates an unenforceable warranty, leaving the practitioner vulnerable to charges of fraud or deceptive marketing."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Framing services as spiritual counseling, educational analysis, or self-help tools is a common legal strategy to distinguish astrology from 'fortune telling for hire,' which is still regulated or banned in some local municipalities."

                "'I cannot answer that because I am not a licensed real estate agent.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This response provides the astrological context (the practitioner's role) while explicitly deferring the final professional decision to the appropriate licensed expert (Realtor/Financial Advisor), thereby maintaining professional boundaries."
