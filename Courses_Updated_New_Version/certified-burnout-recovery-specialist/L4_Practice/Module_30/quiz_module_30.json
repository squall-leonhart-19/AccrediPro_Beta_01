            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A sustainable niche requires the 'Professional Trifecta': a documented high prevalence of burnout, a need for specialized (not generic) recovery, and the financial resources to invest in a premium recovery program."

                "Coaching is unregulated, while psychotherapy is always performed in hospitals",
                "Coaching focuses on functional recovery and goal-attainment, while psychotherapy treats clinical mental disorders (DSM-5)",
                "There is no legal distinction; the terms are interchangeable in a recovery practice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To stay within the scope of practice, specialists must focus on 'functional' recovery and future-oriented strategies, referring out any clients who meet DSM-5 criteria for clinical disorders like MDD or GAD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Signature programs provide a structured roadmap that ensures the client completes all stages of recovery (Physiological, Psychological, and Systems), leading to higher success rates compared to sporadic sessions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Authentic marketing builds trust by offering value upfront, normalizing the burnout experience, and positioning the practitioner as a 'guide' rather than a high-pressure salesperson."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassionate sales includes 'ethical gatekeeping.' If a client is outside the scope of practice, the most professional and helpful act is to provide a referral to the appropriate level of care."
