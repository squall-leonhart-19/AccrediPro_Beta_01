            "question": "When transitioning from a 1:1 model to a Group Recovery Model (L1), what is the 'Tipping Point' metric that suggests a specialist is ready to scale?",
            "options": [
                "When the specialist reaches 50% capacity in 1:1 sessions",
                "When the specialist has a consistent 3-month waitlist or is at 85%+ billable capacity",
                "When the specialist has successfully recovered at least 10 clients",
                "When the specialist completes their first year of practice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Tipping Point' is generally defined as reaching 85% billable capacity or maintaining a 3-month waitlist, indicating that demand exceeds the specialist's time and a group model is required to maintain growth."

            "question": "In Corporate Burnout Consulting (L2), which 'Value Metric' is most persuasive when pitching high-ticket B2B programs to C-Suite executives?",

                "Individual employee happiness scores",
                "The number of coaching hours provided per month",
                "The reduction in 'Presenteeism' and associated lost productivity costs",
                "The aesthetic quality of the digital recovery portal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "B2B programs are sold on ROI. Presenteeism (working while ill or disengaged) costs companies significantly more than absenteeism, and demonstrating a reduction in these costs is the primary driver for high-ticket contracts."

            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "The Executive RESTORE™ framework (L3) identifies 'Decision Fatigue' as a primary burnout driver. How does this high-stakes coaching model address this specifically?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Executive recovery must minimize cognitive load. The RESTORE™ framework uses cognitive offloading and curated paths to ensure the recovery process itself doesn't contribute to further decision fatigue."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "To act as a repository for academic papers only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digital assets allow a specialist to help those who cannot afford high-ticket coaching, serving as an entry-level product that builds authority and filters candidates for higher-level programs."

                "Allowing associates to use their own diverse methods to treat the specialist's clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To scale without diluting results, associates must be trained in the proprietary methodology and undergo a shadowing/vetting period to ensure they deliver the same standard of care as the founder."

            "options": [
                "1:50 (One coach to fifty clients)",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In B2B scaling, price resistance is countered by highlighting the 'Cost of Inaction.' By showing the company how much they lose by NOT addressing burnout (turnover, premiums, errors), the program's price becomes a logical investment."
