            "options": [
                "The facilitator's ability to treat all members exactly the same regardless of symptoms.",
                "The realization among members that their struggles are not unique, which reduces shame and isolation.",
                "The application of a single recovery framework across all global cultures.",
                "The process of ensuring all group members reach the same recovery milestone at the same time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universality is one of Irvin Yalom's therapeutic factors; in burnout recovery, it is the powerful realization that one is not alone, which directly counteracts the 'isolation' phase of burnout."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a cohort setting, the 'Energy Management' phase uses collective intelligence to identify common 'energy leaks' (e.g., meeting culture, Slack notifications) that affect the entire group or industry."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "During a facilitation session, you notice a 'Monopolizer' taking up 70% of the airtime. According to Lesson 3, what is the best facilitation move?",

                "Ignore the behavior to avoid creating conflict within the cohort.",
                "Wait until the end of the 12-week program to address it in the final evaluation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced facilitation requires 'Gate-closing' for over-contributors and 'Gate-opening' for under-contributors to balance the group dynamic and ensure equitable participation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triage workshops are 'emergency' interventions designed to stop the 'bleeding' of high turnover and acute stress by providing immediate tools for regulation and safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital fatigue is a specific risk for burnout recovery groups; facilitators must use 'low-stimulus' delivery methods and frequent 'off-camera' breaks to mitigate this."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first month of an intensive must focus on physiological stabilization; a burnt-out brain cannot engage in high-level 'transformation' until the nervous system is out of 'fight-or-flight' mode."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional certification requires objective data. Using validated tools like the MBI or OLBI to show an aggregate reduction in exhaustion scores is the gold standard for clinical documentation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling a practice involves moving from trading hours for dollars (1-to-1) to group models where the hourly rate effectively increases as more participants join the same delivery hour."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While friendships are good, 'cliques' or sub-groups can make other members feel excluded. Facilitators should proactively mix groups to maintain total cohort cohesion."
