            "question": "In Lesson 1, which burnout phenotype is characterized by high levels of 'Cynicism' and 'Reduced Professional Efficacy' while maintaining relatively low 'Exhaustion' scores compared to other types?",
            "options": [
                "The Frenetic Burnout Phenotype",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Under-challenged phenotype is specifically characterized by high cynicism and low efficacy due to lack of stimulation, often without the extreme physical exhaustion seen in the Frenetic type."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 focuses on physiological safety. The priority is down-regulating the overactive sympathetic nervous system and restoring parasympathetic tone (the vagal brake)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low HRV indicates that the autonomic nervous system is stuck in a 'fight or flight' state (sympathetic dominance) and lacks the flexibility to adapt to stressors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity-Performance Fusion is the core cognitive distortion where the individual's self-worth is entirely dependent on their external achievements and productivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ultradian rhythms dictate that the human brain can maintain high-level focus for roughly 90 minutes before needing a physiological break to replenish energy stores."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical pathology, including active suicidality or major depression, falls outside the scope of recovery coaching and requires immediate clinical referral."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phased re-entry (stepped approach) is the gold standard for reintegration, allowing the nervous system to adapt to work stressors gradually."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that recovery plans incorporating 'Somatic Regulation' alongside 'Cognitive Restructuring' resulted in what percentage higher success rate than cognitive interventions alone?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "22%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that integrated protocols (Somatic + Cognitive) are significantly more effective (approx. 42%) because they address both the 'bottom-up' physiological and 'top-down' psychological components of burnout."
