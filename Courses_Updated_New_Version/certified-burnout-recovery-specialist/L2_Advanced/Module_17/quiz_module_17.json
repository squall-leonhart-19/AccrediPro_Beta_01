                "Pervasive anhedonia across all life domains",
                "Context-specific exhaustion that improves when away from the workplace",
                "Global feelings of worthlessness and suicidal ideation",
                "Persistent sleep disturbances unrelated to work anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While depression is pervasive across all areas of life, burnout is primarily context-driven. Symptoms often show significant temporary improvement during vacations or weekends away from the professional environment."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In C-Suite and Medical professionals, what phenomenon describes the psychological state where an individual's self-worth is entirely inseparable from their professional title and achievements?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity Fusion occurs when the boundary between the 'self' and the 'professional role' disappears, making career setbacks feel like existential threats and making recovery difficult without identity reconstruction."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Which factor is a primary driver of 'Autistic Burnout' that distinguishes it from standard occupational burnout?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic burnout is often the result of years of 'masking' (camouflaging neurodivergent traits to fit into a neurotypical world), leading to a total collapse of executive function and sensory processing."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client feels trapped in a toxic high-earning role because their lifestyle expenses require their current salary. This 'Golden Handcuffs' scenario is best addressed by:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovery from financial entrapment requires a dual approach: tactical financial planning (the runway) and psychological work to reduce the need for 'status signaling' through consumption."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Fawn' response is a trauma-based survival strategy where the individual attempts to appease others to avoid conflict, frequently leading to over-commitment and burnout."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In late-stage burnout, the HPA-axis becomes dysregulated to the point of 'exhaustion,' where the body can no longer produce sufficient cortisol, resulting in a flat-lined diurnal rhythm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the environment is the problem and exit is not immediate, the coach must help the client implement Radical Detachment—emotionally disengaging from the outcome to preserve internal resources."

            "id": "q17_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that for severe, chronic burnout involving HPA-axis dysregulation, the nervous system and metabolic functions often require 12 to 24 months of sustained intervention for full recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-achievers rarely succeed with total passivity. Instead, they need 'Hard-Stops' (non-negotiable rest) and an awareness of their specific 'Red Flags' (e.g., return of specific cynical thoughts) to catch relapse early."
