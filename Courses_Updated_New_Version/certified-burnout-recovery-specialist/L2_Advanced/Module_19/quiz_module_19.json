            "question": "According to neurobiological research (Lesson 1), chronic burnout is most closely associated with which structural change in the brain?",
            "options": [
                "Increased gray matter density in the Hippocampus",
                "Thinning of the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and amygdala enlargement",
                "Hyper-connectivity between the PFC and the Basal Ganglia",
                "Decreased activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that chronic burnout leads to structural remodeling, specifically the thinning of the Prefrontal Cortex (weakening executive control) and enlargement of the Amygdala (increasing emotional reactivity)."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the context of psychometric validity (Lesson 2), what does the 'MBI' measure as the three core dimensions of burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Stress, Anxiety, and Depression",
                "Workload, Control, and Reward",
                "Exhaustion, Depersonalization/Cynicism, and Reduced Personal Accomplishment",
                "Insomnia, Irritability, and Cognitive Fog"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is the gold standard psychometric tool, measuring Exhaustion, Depersonalization (Cynicism), and Reduced Personal Accomplishment (Efficacy)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model (Lesson 3), burnout occurs primarily when:",
            "options": [
                "Job demands are high, regardless of resources",
                "Job resources are high, but demands are low",
                "Job demands exceed the buffering capacity of available job resources",
                "An individual lacks personal resilience despite low demands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The JD-R model posits that while high demands lead to exhaustion, 'resources' (autonomy, support, feedback) act as a buffer. Burnout is the result of an imbalance where demands outweigh resources."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Polyvagal research (Lesson 4) identifies the 'Social Engagement System' as being governed by which branch of the nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic-Adrenal-Medullary (SAM) axis",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (immobilization)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is responsible for the 'safety and social engagement' state, which is the physiological prerequisite for true burnout recovery and restoration."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Research on the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) in burnout-affected individuals typically reveals which pattern? (Lesson 6)",
            "options": [
                "A sharp 50% increase in cortisol 30 minutes after waking",
                "A 'blunted' or flattened CAR, indicating HPA-axis dysregulation",
                "Consistently high cortisol levels throughout the entire 24-hour cycle",
                "A surge of cortisol only during evening hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'blunted' CAR is a hallmark of the later stages of burnout, where the HPA axis no longer produces the expected morning surge of cortisol to prepare the body for the day."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "In the 'Cognitive Transformation' evidence (Lesson 5), what is the 'Self-Complexity' theory's relevance to burnout recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Individuals with more varied life roles (parent, athlete, volunteer) recover faster than those whose identity is solely work-based",
                "Recovery is faster when a person simplifies their life to a single focus",
                "Cognitive load should be increased to 'distract' the brain from stress",
                "High self-complexity is a risk factor for cognitive fragmentation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Linville’s Self-Complexity Theory suggests that having multiple, distinct self-aspects (roles) buffers against stress, as a failure in one domain (work) does not devastate the entire self-concept."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "According to longitudinal recovery data (Lesson 8), which symptom is typically the LAST to return to baseline levels?",
            "options": [
                "Physical fatigue",
                "Sleep latency",
                "Executive cognitive function (concentration and memory)",
                "Emotional irritability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While physical energy often returns within weeks or months of rest, longitudinal studies show that cognitive 'weariness' and executive function deficits can persist for 6 to 18 months."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What does the research say about the efficacy of 'Person-Directed' interventions (e.g., individual mindfulness) vs. 'Organization-Directed' interventions? (Lesson 3)",
            "options": [
                "Person-directed interventions are the only way to achieve permanent recovery",
                "Organization-directed interventions have zero impact on individual stress",
                "Person-directed interventions show short-term gains, but organization-directed changes are required for sustainable burnout reduction",
                "There is no research evidence for organizational interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses show that while individual coping skills (person-directed) help, they are often 'band-aids' if the systemic stressors (organization-directed) are not addressed."

            "id": "q19_9",

            "options": [
                "Higher salary and faster promotions",
                "Reduced depersonalization and higher professional efficacy",
                "Increased sympathetic nervous system activation",
                "Lower educational requirements for a role"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When an individual's personal values align with their organizational environment (Value-Congruence), they experience significantly lower rates of depersonalization/cynicism and higher efficacy."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "In psychometric research, what is the 'Discriminant Validity' challenge when diagnosing burnout? (Lesson 2)",
            "options": [
                "Distinguishing burnout from general work-related stress",
                "Ensuring the test is available in multiple languages",
                "Distinguishing burnout from Clinical Depression, as they share overlapping symptoms like fatigue and anhedonia",
                "Measuring the difference between physical and mental exhaustion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Discriminant validity refers to the ability of a tool to distinguish between two different constructs. Research continues to debate whether burnout is a distinct phenomenon or a work-context-specific form of depression."
