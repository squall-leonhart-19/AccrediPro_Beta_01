            "question": "Under the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Boundary framework, which of the following scenarios necessitates an immediate referral to a licensed clinical mental health professional?",
            "options": [
                "A client reporting 'Sunday Scaries' and mild insomnia",
                "A client expressing active suicidal ideation or intent to self-harm",
                "A client struggling with time management and work-life balance",
                "A client requesting a specific somatic breathing exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The R.E.S.T.O.R.E. boundary dictates that clinical symptoms, specifically safety risks like suicidal ideation, fall outside the scope of a recovery specialist and require immediate clinical intervention."

            "question": "In a 'Triadic Corporate Relationship,' where a company pays for an employee's burnout recovery coaching, who owns the right to the specific content discussed in sessions?",
            "options": [
                "The corporate sponsor (the employer)",
                "The recovery specialist and the company jointly",
                "The individual client (the employee)",
                "The HR department of the sponsoring organization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethically, confidentiality remains with the individual client. While the sponsor may receive progress reports on attendance or high-level themes, session content is protected unless a specific waiver is signed."

        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "What is a critical component of 'High-Stakes Informed Consent' that distinguishes it from standard coaching agreements?",

                "A requirement that the client must quit their job to see results"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-stakes recovery involving somatic protocols requires informing clients about the potential for nervous system dysregulation or 'flooding' as suppressed stressors are processed."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A practitioner is asked to work with a close personal friend who is experiencing severe burnout. Why is this considered an ethically 'Dual Relationship' risk?",
            "options": [
                "It is not a risk; personal rapport speeds up the recovery process",
                "It complicates the practitioner's objectivity and creates a power imbalance that can hinder honest recovery",
                "It is only a risk if the practitioner charges the friend a full fee",
                "It is only a risk if the friend works in the same industry"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships impair professional judgment and increase the risk of boundary crossings, which can compromise the efficacy of the burnout recovery intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners have an ethical duty to monitor the client's autonomic state and ensure they do not push the client into hyper-arousal or hypo-arousal (dissociation) during recovery work."

            "id": "q22_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practitioners must account for 'weathering'—the physiological erosion caused by systemic stressors—rather than attributing burnout solely to individual lifestyle choices."

                "A legal term for malpractice in somatic therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious traumatization is an ethical concern where the specialist's own mental health and competence are compromised by the heavy emotional load of their clients' stories."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Objective data must be observable and measurable (e.g., PHQ-9 scores, HRV data, or observed physical tremors) to mitigate liability and provide a clear recovery track."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a PHQ-9 score of 22 and reports they have stopped eating and bathing. What is the most ethical 'Scope of Practice' action?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A PHQ-9 score over 20 indicates severe depression. Ethically, the specialist must refer the client to clinical care, as this exceeds the scope of burnout recovery coaching."

            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Liability Mitigation,' what does the 'Standard of Care' refer to?",

                "The most expensive recovery package offered by the practitioner",
                "The level of skill and care that a reasonably competent specialist in the same field would provide",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard of Care is the legal and ethical benchmark used to determine if a practitioner acted appropriately. Following the protocols taught in this certification helps establish this standard."
