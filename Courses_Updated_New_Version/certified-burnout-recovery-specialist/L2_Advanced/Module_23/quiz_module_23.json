            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which physiological state must be prioritized to facilitate neurobiological 'safety' and social engagement during burnout recovery?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (immobilization)",
                "The Sympathetic Adrenal Medullary (SAM) axis",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (social engagement system)",
                "The HPA-axis activation phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is the 'safe and social' state. For burnout recovery, shifting a client out of sympathetic (fight/flight) or dorsal vagal (shutdown) and into ventral vagal regulation is the foundation of somatic stabilization."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the deconstruction of High-Performance Perfectionism, which factor is the strongest predictor of clinical burnout according to the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale?",
            "options": [
                "High Personal Standards",
                "Socially Prescribed Perfectionism (Maladaptive Evaluative Concerns)",
                "Organization and Tidiness",
                "Striving for Excellence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 'Socially Prescribed Perfectionism'—the belief that others hold unrealistic expectations of you—is significantly more correlated with burnout and depression than simply having high personal standards."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "To optimize chronobiological recovery, the 'Ultradian Healing Response' suggests that the human brain requires a break after approximately how many minutes of high-focus work?",
            "options": [
                "45 minutes",
                "90 to 120 minutes",

                "240 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ultradian rhythms operate on roughly 90-120 minute cycles. Ignoring the 'Ultradian Healing Response' (the signal to rest at the end of a cycle) leads to 'Ultradian Stress Syndrome,' characterized by mental fog and fatigue."

            "options": [
                "Overtime hours that are tracked but unpaid",
                "The cognitive load of planning, remembering, and delegating tasks",

                "Manual data entry tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Invisible labor, or the 'mental load,' refers to the non-tangible work of anticipation, research, and management that often goes unacknowledged but consumes significant cognitive resources."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Which neurochemical protocol is most effective for a client experiencing 'Dopamine Baseline Depletion' (characterized by anhedonia and lack of drive)?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) late at night",
                "Increasing 'cheap' dopamine hits through social media",

                "Chronic caffeine consumption to force alertness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Restoring the dopamine baseline requires reducing 'cheap' dopamine spikes and utilizing protocols like NSDR to replenish neurochemical reserves and upregulate receptor sensitivity."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In Existential Re-Alignment, what is the primary distinction between a 'Value' and a 'Goal'?",
            "options": [
                "Goals are internal; Values are external",
                "Values are never fully 'achieved' but rather 'lived'; Goals are specific, finishable outcomes",
                "Values are only for personal life; Goals are for professional life",
                "There is no functional difference in a coaching context"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Values are like a compass (a direction of travel), whereas goals are like landmarks (destinations). Burnout often occurs when a client achieves goals that are not aligned with their core values."

            "id": "q23_7",

                "C-Reactive Protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF acts as 'fertilizer' for the brain, supporting the survival of existing neurons and encouraging the growth of new ones. Aerobic exercise and quality sleep are key drivers of BDNF production."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Predictive Coding' errors, where they anticipate every email as a threat. Which intervention from Lesson 7 (Resilience Engineering) is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) to recalibrate the threat response",
                "Immediate resignation from their position",
                "Increasing their workload to 'prove' they can handle it",
                "Avoiding all emails for 30 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) helps clients build psychological 'antibodies' by exposing them to manageable levels of stress while practicing regulation techniques, recalibrating the brain's predictive models."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovery coaches must operate within their scope of practice. Suicidal ideation, self-harm, or severe clinical pathology require immediate referral to licensed mental health professionals."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "The 'Cognitive Deconstruction' of perfectionism involves moving a client from 'All-or-Nothing' thinking to which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Lowering all standards to the minimum acceptable level",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dialectical thinking allows a client to hold the truth that they can strive for excellence while also accepting imperfections, breaking the rigid 'success or failure' binary of perfectionism."
