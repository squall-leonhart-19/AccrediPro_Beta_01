            "question": "In the RESTORE Matrix case formulation, which domain specifically addresses the 'Friction Audit' of a client's physical and digital workspaces?",
            "options": [
                "The Resilience Domain",
                "The Occupational Domain",
                "The Environment Domain",
                "The Somatic Domain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Environment Domain focuses on the external factors, including physical and digital workspaces, using tools like the Friction Audit to identify and remove energy-draining stressors."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "The 'S-T Bridge' (Somatic-Thought) is primarily designed to address which neurological phenomenon in burnout recovery?",

                "Parasympathetic dominance in high-stress environments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The S-T Bridge focuses on integrating somatic (bottom-up) and cognitive (top-down) processing to resolve the dissociation that occurs when the amygdala is overactive and the prefrontal cortex is offline."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to the Systemic Integration lesson, what is the 'Rule of 1%' regarding habit reconstruction in recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Only 1% of habits actually matter for burnout",

                "1% of the client's income should be spent on environmental optimization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Narrative Pivot is the process of helping the client shift their self-story from one of depletion and victimhood (Burnout Identity) to one of integration, agency, and sustainable performance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-Performance Recovery balances physiological readiness (measured via HRV) with psychological demands (Cognitive Load) to ensure the client stays in a 'Flow' state rather than a 'Strain' state."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "Under the EVOLVE Protocol, what is the primary purpose of the 'Quarterly Audit'?",
            "options": [
                "To bill the client for another session",
                "To identify 'Adaptive Drift' before it leads to a full relapse",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive Drift is the slow return to old, maladaptive habits. The Quarterly Audit is designed to catch these subtle shifts early to prevent a burnout relapse."

                "Ignore it and continue with the cognitive coaching questions",
                "Pause the cognitive discussion to implement a somatic grounding tool immediately",
                "Tell the client they are being dramatic and should calm down",
                "End the session immediately as the client is too dysregulated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RESTORE Flow requires practitioners to be responsive to somatic cues. Pausing to ground the client ensures that the 'S-T Bridge' remains intact for productive coaching."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study referenced in the module showed that integrated (Somatic + Cognitive) burnout interventions resulted in what percentage higher retention of recovery gains compared to cognitive-only approaches?",

                "15%",
                "25%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that synthesizing somatic and cognitive approaches leads to a 42% higher retention rate of recovery outcomes because it addresses the nervous system and the mind simultaneously."

            "question": "Your client, Sarah, has mastered her morning routine but feels 'the crash' at 3:00 PM every day. Using Systemic Integration (L3), what is the most likely focus for synthesis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic Integration looks for 'energy leaks' in the daily timeline. A 'Somatic Reset' before the anticipated crash point proactively manages the nervous system's capacity."
