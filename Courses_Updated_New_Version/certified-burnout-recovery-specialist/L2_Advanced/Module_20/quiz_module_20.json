            "options": [
                "Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Reduced Personal Accomplishment",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS) defines burnout through three specific dimensions: Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization (cynicism toward clients), and a sense of Reduced Personal Accomplishment."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client scores high on the Exhaustion scale but maintains high scores in Personal Accomplishment. Based on MBI profiling, how should this client be categorized?",
            "options": [

                "Disengaged",
                "Overextended",
                "Ineffective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Overextended' profile is characterized by high exhaustion scores alone, while the other dimensions (cynicism/accomplishment) remain in the healthy or moderate range."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) is highlighted for its unique psychometric design. What is its primary advantage over the MBI?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only tool that measures cortisol levels alongside psychological data.",
                "It includes both positively and negatively worded items to prevent response bias.",
                "It specifically excludes work-related factors to focus on personal burnout.",
                "It is designed to be completed in under 2 minutes for high-stress environments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The OLBI uses 'balanced' wording (both positive and negative items) to overcome the 'one-sided' phrasing of the MBI, which can lead to artificial inflation of scores."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) is preferred in certain clinical settings because it separates burnout into which three distinct domains?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CBI is unique because it attributes the source of fatigue to three different areas: the person's general life (Personal), their specific job (Work), or their interactions with people/clients (Client)."

            "id": "q20_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A flat diurnal slope, characterized by the loss of the morning 'cortisol awakening response' and elevated evening levels, is a hallmark of chronic, long-term stress and burnout-related HPA-axis dysfunction."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all six areas matter, 'Workload' (the demand-resource mismatch) has the most direct and significant correlation with the Exhaustion dimension of burnout."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client reports feeling successful at work but feels a deep sense of 'moral injury' because the company's practices conflict with their integrity. Which assessment tool is most appropriate for this specific issue?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Values subscale of the Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS) or specific Cognitive/Value-Based tools are designed to identify 'mismatches' between personal ethics and organizational requirements."

            "options": [
                "Immediately begin high-intensity cognitive behavioral restructuring.",
                "Advise the client that they are fully recovered and ready for promotion.",
                "Focus on foundational stabilization and nervous system regulation before deep psychological work.",
                "Limit interventions to physical exercise only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Orange Zone (40-60%) indicates that the client's 'bandwidth' for change is limited; practitioners must stabilize the client's physiology and environment before attempting complex psychological interventions."

            "options": [
                "To compare the results of the MBI, physiological markers, and systemic audits to find common themes.",
                "To involve the client’s spouse and employer in the assessment process.",
                "To calculate the total cost of the recovery program.",
                "To determine which of the three stages of burnout the client is currently in."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Triangulation involves looking at multiple data points (psychological, physiological, and systemic) to ensure the recovery plan addresses the actual root causes rather than just symptoms."

                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Resting Respiratory Rate",
                "Systolic Blood Pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a primary indicator of strong vagal tone and the body's ability to switch from a sympathetic (stress) state to a parasympathetic (recovery) state."
