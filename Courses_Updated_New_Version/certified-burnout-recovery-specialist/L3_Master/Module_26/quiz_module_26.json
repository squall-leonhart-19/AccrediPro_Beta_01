            "question": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™, why is 'Somatic Safety' (Phase 2) positioned before 'Cognitive Reconstruction' (Phase 4)?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client has the physical energy to complete cognitive homework.",
                "Because bottom-up regulation is required to move the client out of a survival state before the prefrontal cortex can engage effectively.",
                "To prioritize physical fitness and weight loss as primary burnout recovery metrics.",
                "Because somatic work is faster to implement than cognitive behavioral changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective burnout recovery requires 'bottom-up' regulation; until the nervous system feels safe and exits the sympathetic/dorsal survival states, the prefrontal cortex (responsible for cognitive work) remains functionally offline."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "During Data-Driven Program Initialization (L2), a Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reading with a consistently low SDNN (below 20ms) most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Optimal recovery and high parasympathetic tone.",
                "A state of 'Flow' and high cognitive engagement.",
                "Chronic sympathetic dominance and a lack of autonomic flexibility.",
                "The successful integration of the Stabilization Protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) in HRV data is a biological marker of chronic stress and sympathetic dominance, indicating that the nervous system is 'stuck' in a stress response."

            "options": [
                "Always push the client into high-intensity exercise to 'burn off' cortisol.",
                "Keep the client within a range of arousal where they can process information without becoming overwhelmed or shut down.",
                "Focus exclusively on hyper-arousal states, as hypo-arousal is not a feature of burnout.",
                "Be delivered in 4-hour intensive blocks to maximize neuroplasticity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the zone where a person can function and process emotions effectively. Recovery work must stay within this window to avoid re-traumatization or further burnout."

                "The inability to use project management software effectively.",
                "A physical deformity caused by repetitive strain at a desk.",

                "A preference for multitasking over deep work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Productivity Dysmorphia is the cognitive distortion where a client's worth is so tied to output that they cannot acknowledge their achievements, leading to a 'hamster wheel' of constant over-extension."

                "A 90% reduction in caffeine and a 20% increase in protein."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The human body operates on ultradian rhythms; working in 90-minute blocks followed by 20-minute breaks aligns with natural energy cycles and prevents the accumulation of 'attention residue' and fatigue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout often stems from living according to 'introjected' values (what we think we 'should' do for others). The Reclaim Protocol helps clients identify their true intrinsic values to reconstruct a purposeful life."

                "Resigning from a current job position."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators are subtle, early warning signs. Erosion of micro-boundaries (like morning routines) often precedes the more severe symptoms of a burnout relapse."

            "options": [
                "It reduces the cost for the coach while increasing the hourly rate.",
                "It provides 'Social Safety' and reduces the shame/isolation often felt by high-performers in burnout.",
                "It allows the coach to spend less time on individual assessments.",
                "It encourages healthy competition between clients to see who recovers fastest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout is often accompanied by intense shame. Group models provide social normalization and 'co-regulation,' which are powerful somatic and psychological tools for recovery."

                "Intensive time-management training.",
                "Gentle 'mobilization' exercises to shift the client from shutdown into a safe sympathetic/ventral state.",

                "Challenging their core beliefs about productivity immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A client in a Dorsal Vagal (shutdown) state needs gentle mobilization to emerge from the 'freeze' response safely. HIIT or cognitive challenging may be too aggressive and cause further withdrawal."

                "Only the individual's resilience skills.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable corporate recovery requires a dual approach: teaching individuals how to regulate (individual) and addressing the systemic workload and resource issues (organizational) using the JD-R model."
