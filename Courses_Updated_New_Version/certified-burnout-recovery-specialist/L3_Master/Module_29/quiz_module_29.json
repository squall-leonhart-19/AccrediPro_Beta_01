            "question": "What defines the shift from an 'Intervention' mindset to an 'Integration' mindset in the L3 Practitioner approach?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from fixing specific symptoms to facilitating a cohesive new identity and lifestyle alignment",
                "Increasing the number of somatic exercises performed per session",
                "Focusing exclusively on workplace policy changes rather than individual resilience",
                "Transitioning from evidence-based protocols to purely intuitive coaching methods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L3 integration represents the highest level of mastery, where the practitioner helps the client synthesize their recovery into a sustainable, evolved identity rather than just 'fixing' burnout symptoms."

            "question": "In the advanced synthesis of the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™, how should the seven stages be applied at the Master level?",
            "options": [
                "As a strict, linear 7-week sequence that must be followed in order",
                "As a non-linear, emergent process where stages are integrated based on the client's real-time physiological and psychological readiness",
                "By skipping the 'Stabilize' phase to focus immediately on 'Evolve'",
                "By using only the 'Rest' and 'Restore' components for clinical populations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves clinical fluidity—recognizing that the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. elements often overlap and require simultaneous integration based on the client's unique presentation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "A client presents with deep resentment, a sense of 'soul-wounding,' and feels betrayed by their organization's unethical demands. Which clinical complexity is most likely present?",

                "Standard Occupational Burnout",
                "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Moral injury is characterized by the psychological distress that results from actions, or the lack of them, which violate deeply held moral beliefs and expectations, often involving a sense of betrayal by authority."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "According to the Somatic-Cognitive Synthesis (Lesson 4), why is bridging 'Stabilize' and 'Transform' essential for long-term recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Because cognitive behavioral changes cannot be sustained if the nervous system remains in a state of chronic dysregulation",
                "Because clients prefer somatic exercises over cognitive reframing",
                "Because stabilization is only necessary for the first 24 hours of burnout",
                "Because transformation is purely a biological process that does not require mindset shifts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'bridge' ensures that the client's physiology (bottom-up) supports their new cognitive narratives and boundaries (top-down), preventing a relapse into old patterns."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental Architecture focuses on optimizing the external world (Choice Architecture) to preserve the client's limited cognitive resources and 'nudge' them toward recovery behaviors."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "The 'Existential Pivot' (Lesson 6) describes the transition from 'Doing' to 'Being.' What is a primary marker of this shift in a recovering client?",
            "options": [
                "The client works 10% fewer hours than before",
                "The client derives their self-worth from internal values rather than external productivity metrics and 'performance identity'",
                "The client completely retires from their profession",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Existential Pivot involves reclaiming agency and decoupling one's identity from 'the grind' or constant productivity, allowing for a values-based existence."

                "Ensuring the client never experiences stress again",
                "Focusing on physical fitness as the only measure of resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Evolve Protocol moves beyond 'bouncing back' (resilience) to 'bouncing forward' (antifragility), where the burnout experience becomes a catalyst for profound personal growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Master Blueprint connects the body's early signals (somatic markers) with specific mindset shifts (cognitive anchors) to create a self-correcting feedback loop for the client."

            "id": "q29_9",

            "options": [
                "Burnout is always accompanied by high fever, whereas depression is not",
                "Depression is usually context-independent and pervasive, while Burnout is primarily context-specific (related to the work environment or specific roles)",
                "Burnout only affects people over the age of 40",
                "There is no difference; they are the same clinical condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While they share symptoms like exhaustion, burnout is traditionally tied to a specific domain (like work), whereas clinical depression tends to pervade all areas of a person's life regardless of the environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Once physiological stability is met, the 'Master' practitioner must address the existential and identity-based aspects of burnout to ensure the client doesn't return to the same hollow patterns that caused the initial collapse."
