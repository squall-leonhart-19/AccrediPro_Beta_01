            "question": "When managing an 'Acute Burnout Crisis' (Lesson 1), what is the immediate clinical priority before beginning cognitive or behavioral restructuring?",
            "options": [
                "Identifying the root cause of workplace stress",
                "Physiological stabilization and establishing physical safety",

                "Implementing a high-intensity exercise regimen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In an acute crisis, the nervous system is in a state of 'autonomic collapse.' Immediate priority must be physiological stabilization (sleep, hydration, removal from the stressor) and ensuring the client is not a danger to themselves."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Burnout is context-specific (related to work), whereas MDD is pervasive. In burnout, a client may still enjoy hobbies or family time initially, while MDD involves a global loss of pleasure (anhedonia)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-stakes professionals often face 'career-ending' consequences for admitting mental health struggles due to strict regulatory and licensing boards (e.g., FAA for pilots, Medical Boards for surgeons)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrapment is a key psychological driver of suicidality in burnout. It is the internal or external perception that there is no way out of the exhausting circumstances, making death seem like the only 'exit.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Masking (suppressing neurodivergent traits) requires significant cognitive energy. For ADHD or Autistic individuals, the 'cost of masking' leads to faster depletion of resources and higher relapse rates if not addressed."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Burnout Recovery Specialist is not a prescriber. Their role is to provide a 'feedback loop' for the medical professional, monitoring how symptoms change and ensuring the client adheres to the medical plan."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Return of the Mask' is a behavioral red flag. It indicates the client is no longer using boundaries and is returning to the unsustainable patterns that caused the initial burnout."
