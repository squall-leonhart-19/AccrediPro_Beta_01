            "question": "When performing an advanced differential assessment, which clinical indicator is most characteristic of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) but is typically absent in pure Occupational Burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Pervasive anhedonia across all life domains (work and personal)",
                "Physical exhaustion and fatigue",
                "Reduced professional efficacy and cynicism",
                "Irritability and low frustration tolerance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While burnout and MDD share symptoms like exhaustion, pure burnout is context-specific (work-related). Pervasive anhedonia—the inability to feel pleasure in any activity, including hobbies and family life—is a hallmark of MDD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the Maslach 6-Areas of Worklife model, which organizational driver is most statistically predictive of the 'Exhaustion' component of burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Absence of Fairness",
                "Breakdown of Community",
                "Workload (Mismatched demands)",
                "Conflicting Values"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all six areas contribute to burnout, 'Workload' is the most direct predictor of the energy depletion/exhaustion dimension, whereas 'Values' and 'Fairness' often predict cynicism."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "In Polyvagal Theory, a client in a 'Functional Freeze' state is primarily utilizing which branch of the nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal Complex (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic Nervous System (High Arousal)",
                "Dorsal Vagal Complex (High-tone immobilization)",
                "A blend of Sympathetic and Dorsal Vagal systems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Functional freeze is a 'mixed state' where the individual is physiologically immobilized (Dorsal) but forced to remain active/mobilized (Sympathetic) to meet work demands, leading to profound metabolic depletion."

        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A 'High-Performer' client believes their worth is entirely dependent on their last achievement. This cognitive structure is known as:",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Dissonance",
                "Over-identification with the Achiever Archetype",
                "The Dunning-Kruger Effect",
                "External Locus of Control"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners must address the 'Achiever Archetype'—a cognitive identity where the ego is fused with productivity, making recovery difficult because 'resting' feels like 'dying' to the ego."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "Research into Circadian Biology (Lesson 5) indicates that chronic burnout often leads to a 'blunted' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). Why is this significant for recovery?",
            "options": [
                "It means the client has too much energy in the morning",
                "It indicates a failure of the HPA axis to prepare the body for the day's metabolic demands",
                "It proves the client is just lazy and needs better motivation",
                "It suggests the client should skip breakfast"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CAR is a 35-60% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A blunted CAR is a biological marker of burnout, indicating the body can no longer effectively mobilize resources for the day."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "In the 'Existential Reclaiming' phase, what is the primary goal of fostering 'Agency'?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client find a new job immediately",
                "To shift the client from a 'victim' orientation to seeing themselves as the 'author' of their choices",
                "To increase the client's tolerance for toxic environments",
                "To eliminate all stress from the client's life"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Agency is the existential capacity to influence one’s own functioning and life circumstances. It is the antidote to 'learned helplessness' which often accompanies late-stage burnout."

        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "Applying Nassim Taleb’s 'Anti-fragility' to burnout recovery means the professional should:",
            "options": [
                "Avoid all future stress to prevent a relapse",
                "Return exactly to the same state they were in before the burnout",
                "Use the 'stress' of burnout as a catalyst to build a more robust, adaptable identity",
                "Ignore the burnout and 'push through' to build toughness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resilience is 'bouncing back' to the original state. Anti-fragility is 'growing' and becoming better because of the stressor. Master practitioners aim for anti-fragility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "As a Master Practitioner, noticing that you are 'working harder than the client' is a sign of which ethical/boundary issue?",
            "options": [
                "Scope of Practice violation",
                "Counter-transference (specifically the 'Rescuer' role)",
                "Professional Negligence",
                "Confidentiality Breach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a practitioner feels a desperate need to 'save' the client or works harder than the client does, it is a counter-transference issue that can lead to practitioner burnout and hinder client growth."

        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "Which 'Optimization Science' intervention is most effective for resynchronizing a disrupted circadian rhythm in a burnout client?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose melatonin at noon",
                "Viewing high-intensity natural light (sunlight) within 30 minutes of waking",
                "Drinking 400mg of caffeine before 8:00 AM",
                "Sleeping in until 11:00 AM on weekends"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early morning light exposure triggers the 'cortisol pulse' and sets the 'melatonin timer' for 12-14 hours later, making it the most potent non-pharmacological circadian regulator."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "A 'Toxic System' audit reveals a 'Double Bind' in the client’s workplace. What does this term refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Receiving two paychecks for the same job",
                "Conflicting demands where the client is 'damned if they do and damned if they don't'",
                "Having two different managers with the same goals",
                "A contract that requires 80 hours of work per week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Double Bind is a psychological trap where an individual receives contradictory messages (e.g., 'Be more innovative' but 'Never deviate from the manual'), making success impossible and burnout inevitable."
