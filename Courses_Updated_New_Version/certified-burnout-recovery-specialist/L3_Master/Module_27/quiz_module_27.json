                "Moral injury is caused by long hours, while burnout is caused by low pay.",
                "Moral injury occurs when clinicians are unable to provide high-quality care due to systemic constraints, violating their core values.",
                "Moral injury is a purely psychological state, whereas burnout is a physical state of exhaustion.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical literature."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Moral injury refers to the psychological distress resulting from actions, or the lack thereof, which transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations, often seen when systemic issues prevent healthcare workers from providing the care patients need."
