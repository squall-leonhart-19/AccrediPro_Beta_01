            "question": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™, what is the primary objective of the 'S' (Stabilize) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the systemic environmental stressors and energy-depleting habits.",
                "To implement nervous system regulation and somatic protocols to transition the client into a restorative state.",
                "To decouple the client's self-worth from their professional performance.",
                "To design a long-term resilience protocol to prevent future relapse."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stabilize phase focuses on physiological safety. Before cognitive work (Transform) or systemic changes (Optimize) can occur, the client's nervous system must be regulated out of a chronic sympathetic (fight/flight) or dorsal vagal (shutdown) state."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "According to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), which three dimensions define the clinical marker of burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Anxiety, Depression, and Physical Fatigue.",
                "Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization (Cynicism), and Reduced Personal Accomplishment.",

                "Workload, Lack of Control, and Insufficient Reward."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MBI, the gold standard for burnout assessment, identifies these three core dimensions. In the 'Recognize' phase, a Specialist looks for high exhaustion/cynicism and low professional efficacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During the 'Evaluate' phase, a Specialist uses the 'Areas of Worklife Scale.' Which of the following is NOT one of the six areas identified by Leiter and Maslach as drivers of burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Workload and Control.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While fitness and nutrition are important for recovery, they are not part of the 'Areas of Worklife Scale,' which focuses on the organizational environment: Workload, Control, Reward, Community, Fairness, and Values."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'blunted' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and chronic fatigue. In which stage of the HPA-axis dysfunction is this client likely situated?",

                "Stage 4: Recovery (Homeostasis)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stage 3 (Exhaustion) is characterized by hypocortisolemia, where the body can no longer produce sufficient cortisol to meet demand, leading to the 'crashed' feeling common in advanced burnout."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",

            "options": [
                "To increase the client's hourly productivity.",

                "To implement a strict 8-hour sleep protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Transform phase targets the 'Internal Drivers' of burnout, specifically the 'Performance-Based Self-Esteem' (PBSE) that makes clients vulnerable to overworking."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "When designing an 'Optimize' protocol, the Specialist encourages the client to work in 90-minute blocks followed by 15-minute breaks. This is based on which physiological principle?",

                "Circadian Rhythms.",
                "Ultradian Rhythms.",

                "The Pomodoro Effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ultradian rhythms are cycles of roughly 90-120 minutes throughout the day. Honoring these cycles by taking breaks prevents the 'high-arousal' state that leads to cumulative exhaustion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ACT principles, particularly 'Values Clarification' and 'Committed Action,' are central to the Reclaim phase to ensure the client’s life is built on internal meaning rather than external validation."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "Which of the following Heart Rate Variability (HRV) readings generally indicates a more resilient and regulated nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "A consistently low HRV (e.g., 20ms).",
                "A high HRV (e.g., 80ms) with significant beat-to-beat variation.",
                "A static heart rate that does not change with breath.",
                "HRV is not a relevant metric for burnout recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates that the autonomic nervous system is flexible and can switch efficiently between sympathetic and parasympathetic states, a key marker of recovery in the 'Stabilize' and 'Evolve' phases."

        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "What is the 'Scope of Practice' boundary for a Burnout Recovery Specialist regarding mental health?",
            "options": [
                "Specialists can diagnose Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) if it is caused by work.",
                "Specialists can prescribe low-dose supplements to manage anxiety.",
                "Specialists must refer out to a licensed clinician if the client exhibits clinical depression, suicidality, or complex trauma.",
                "Specialists are legally equivalent to psychotherapists in most jurisdictions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Specialist focuses on burnout (a work-related syndrome). If symptoms cross into clinical pathology (like MDD or PTSD), ethical and legal guidelines require referral to a licensed mental health professional."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "In the 'Evolve' phase, the Specialist helps the client develop a 'Relapse Prevention Protocol.' What is a 'canary in the coal mine' in this context?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'canary in the coal mine' is a personalized early warning sign (e.g., jaw clenching, losing interest in a hobby) that indicates the client is slipping back into old patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_11",
            "question": "Which neurobiological concept explains why burnout clients often struggle with decision-making and emotional regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Amygdala Hypertrophy and Prefrontal Cortex Thinning.",
                "Increased Hippocampal Volume.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to an overactive amygdala (fear center) and a weakened prefrontal cortex (executive function), making it difficult for burnout sufferers to regulate emotions or make complex decisions."

                "The more a leader shares, the less the group trusts them.",
                "The fear that sharing vulnerability will lead to judgment, while it actually builds group cohesion and safety.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vulnerability Paradox states that while we fear being seen as weak, witnessing vulnerability in others is perceived as courage and creates the 'Psychological Safety' necessary for group recovery."
