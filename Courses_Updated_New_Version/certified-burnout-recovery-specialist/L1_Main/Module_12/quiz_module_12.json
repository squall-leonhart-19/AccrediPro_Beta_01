            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "What is the primary differentiator between the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™ and traditional 'Self-Care' approaches to burnout?",
            "options": [
                "It prioritizes systemic physiological and psychological restructuring over temporary symptom management.",
                "It focuses exclusively on physical rest and sleep hygiene to repair the HPA axis.",
                "It encourages clients to leave their high-stress careers immediately to find balance.",
                "It utilizes high-intensity exercise as the primary method for clearing cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Unlike traditional self-care which often focuses on surface-level 'pampering,' R.E.S.T.O.R.E. targets the root physiological (nervous system) and psychological (identity) drivers of burnout."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In the 'Recognize' phase, a client presenting with 'flat' affect, chronic cynicism, and a 'wired-but-tired' sensation is likely experiencing which physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "Acute Sympathetic Hyper-arousal",
                "Healthy Homeostasis",
                "Functional Hypocortisolism (Stage 3 Burnout)",
                "Parasympathetic Dominance (Rest-and-Digest)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'wired-but-tired' state and cynicism are clinical markers of Stage 3 burnout, where cortisol production begins to dysregulate or 'crash' after prolonged chronic stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "During the 'Evaluate' phase, why is it critical to distinguish between 'Systemic Stressors' and 'Internal Drivers'?",
            "options": [
                "Because Systemic Stressors are the only factors that a coach can actually change.",
                "Because solving an Internal Driver (like perfectionism) won't stop burnout if the Systemic environment (toxic workplace) remains unchanged.",
                "Because Internal Drivers are purely genetic and cannot be modified through coaching.",
                "Because Systemic Stressors are always more important than psychological drivers in every case."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recovery requires addressing both the environment and the individual's response to it; fixing the mindset without addressing the environment (or vice versa) leads to incomplete recovery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A client in the 'Stabilize' phase is stuck in a 'Dorsal Vagal' (Freeze) response. What is the most appropriate somatic intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Vigorous HIIT training to 'break' the freeze state.",
                "Long periods of silent meditation to encourage stillness.",
                "Gentle mobilization, such as slow walking or 'orienting' to the room to signal safety.",
                "Deep tissue massage to release muscle tension immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a Dorsal Vagal state, the nervous system needs cues of safety and very gentle mobilization. Aggressive exercise or forced stillness can often deepen the freeze response."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "The 'Transform' phase focuses on 'Decoupling Self-Worth from Productivity.' This specifically targets which psychological phenomenon?",
            "options": [

                "The Halo Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Contingent Self-Esteem is when an individual's sense of value is dependent on external achievements, a core driver of the 'overworking' cycle in burnout."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Optimize' phase (L6), what is the recommended 'Recovery-Performance' cycle for sustainable cognitive output?",
            "options": [
                "4 hours of deep work followed by a 1-hour lunch break.",
                "Working until a task is completed, regardless of the time taken.",
                "Working in 25-minute Pomodoro sprints with 5-minute phone breaks.",
                "90-minute Ultradian work cycles followed by 15-20 minutes of 'NSDR' or physiological rest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The human brain operates on Ultradian rhythms; 90-minute cycles of focus followed by true physiological rest (not digital distraction) prevents the accumulation of cognitive fatigue."

        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "In the 'Reclaim' phase, how is 'Agency' defined within the context of recovery?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to work harder than one's peers.",
                "The capacity to exert influence over one’s own functioning and environmental circumstances.",
                "The financial freedom to quit a job without a backup plan.",
                "The physical strength to endure high levels of stress without complaint."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Agency is the shift from being a 'victim' of circumstances to being an active participant who sets boundaries and makes choices aligned with their values."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "The 'Evolve' phase (L8) introduces 'Post-Traumatic Growth' (PTG). Which of the following is a hallmark of PTG in burnout recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Returning to the exact same lifestyle that caused the initial burnout.",
                "A total avoidance of all stressful situations in the future.",
                "A shift in perspective where the individual feels a greater sense of personal strength and revised life priorities.",
                "The elimination of the need for sleep or rest due to increased resilience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PTG involves using the 'breakdown' of burnout as a catalyst for a 'breakthrough' in how one views their life, strengths, and relationships."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sarah’s guilt is a psychological driver related to identity and worth, which is the core focus of the 'Transform' phase."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Research cited in the framework suggests that 'Systemic Organizational Factors' (the environment) typically account for what percentage of burnout variance?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 20%, as personal resilience is the main factor.",
                "Approximately 60-70%, as indicated by the Maslach and Leiter models.",
                "100%, as individuals have no control over their burnout levels.",
                "Exactly 50%, split evenly with genetics."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While individual traits matter, organizational research consistently shows that systemic factors (workload, control, reward, community, fairness, values) are the primary drivers of burnout."
