            "question": "According to the neurobiology of sustainable performance, what is the primary consequence of glutamate accumulation in the lateral prefrontal cortex during prolonged cognitive tasks?",
            "options": [
                "Enhanced synaptic plasticity and faster learning",
                "A shift toward 'low-cost' impulsive decision-making and cognitive fatigue",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that intense cognitive work leads to glutamate buildup in the prefrontal cortex, which signals the brain to switch to low-effort, high-reward (impulsive) choices as a fatigue-management strategy."

            "question": "A client categorized as a 'Wolf' chronotype (late-night preference) is struggling with morning brain fog. Based on chronobiology, when should they schedule their most cognitively demanding work?",
            "options": [
                "Between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM",
                "Between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Wolves experience their peak alertness and cognitive capacity much later in the day compared to Lions or Bears, typically reaching their 'flow state' window in the late afternoon or evening."

            "question": "The Basic Rest-Activity Cycle (BRAC) suggests that the human brain moves through ultradian rhythms of high-frequency brain activity followed by a 'recovery' phase. How long is a standard cycle?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ultradian rhythms, specifically the BRAC, operate on roughly 90-minute cycles where cognitive efficiency peaks and then requires a 15-20 minute period of physiological recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 52:17 ratio was found to be the 'golden ratio' for the most productive 10% of users, emphasizing the importance of significant, frequent breaks for sustained output."

                "Engaging in high-intensity 'brain training' games"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ART posits that natural environments allow the 'directed attention' (prefrontal cortex) to rest while 'soft fascination' (involuntary attention) takes over, effectively restoring cognitive resources."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When managing the 'Load-to-Capacity Ratio,' what does the term 'Allostatic Load' represent in a burnout recovery context?",
            "options": [
                "The maximum amount of weight a client can lift in the gym",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load is the physiological cost of chronic stress. In optimization, we aim to reduce this load so it does not exceed the individual's current recovery capacity."
