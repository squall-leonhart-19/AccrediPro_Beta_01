            "question": "In Lesson 1, why is the 'Stabilization' phase prioritized before 'Recovery' or 'Growth' in the Burnout Recovery Specialist™ framework?",
            "options": [
                "Because clients need to feel better immediately to continue the program.",
                "To move the nervous system out of a state of 'functional freeze' so it can actually process restorative interventions.",
                "To ensure the client has enough physical strength to begin an exercise regimen.",
                "Because stabilization is the only phase that involves physiological changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization is critical because a nervous system stuck in dorsal vagal shutdown or high-alert sympathetic arousal cannot effectively absorb 'recovery' protocols; the body must first feel safe enough to shift states."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 2), which state is a client likely in if they report feeling 'numb,' 'spaced out,' and physically heavy?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Activation",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",
                "The Flow State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the most primitive survival mechanism, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and metabolic conservation (shutdown)."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which somatic grounding technique (Lesson 3) is specifically designed to provide 'proprioceptive' feedback to a dissociated client?",
            "options": [
                "Visual scanning of the room for blue objects.",
                "Deep pressure or 'wall pushes' using the large muscle groups.",
                "Gentle humming to stimulate the vagus nerve.",
                "Closing the eyes to focus on internal sensations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioception involves the sense of self-movement and body position. Using large muscles (like pushing against a wall) provides high-intensity feedback that helps 'anchor' a client back into their body."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "To optimize the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) as discussed in Lesson 4, what is the most effective morning intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Drinking 16oz of coffee within 10 minutes of waking.",
                "Viewing 10-30 minutes of natural sunlight shortly after waking.",
                "Performing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) before 7:00 AM.",
                "Staying in a dark room for an extra hour to ensure 'deep rest'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Natural sunlight exposure (photons hitting the retina) triggers the suprachiasmatic nucleus to signal the adrenal glands to produce the necessary cortisol spike for daytime alertness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, why is an 'extended exhalation' (e.g., 4-count inhale, 8-count exhale) used for autonomic down-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It increases oxygen saturation in the blood.",
                "It triggers the Hering-Breuer reflex to stop breathing.",
                "It stimulates the vagus nerve and activates the parasympathetic 'brake'.",
                "It reduces the amount of CO2 in the lungs to prevent acidity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exhalation is linked to the parasympathetic nervous system; by making the exhale longer than the inhale, we signal the heart rate to slow down via the vagus nerve."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client complains of 'misophonia' (irritability toward small sounds) and feeling overwhelmed in grocery stores. Based on Lesson 6, this is a symptom of:",
            "options": [
                "Clinical depression.",
                "Sensory Gating Deficit due to a thinned 'window of tolerance'.",
                "A lack of cognitive discipline.",
                "Early-onset hearing loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In burnout, the brain's ability to filter out 'background' sensory information (sensory gating) is compromised, leading to hyper-vigilance and sensory overload."
        },

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "According to the Metabolic Stabilization protocols (Lesson 7), what is the 'PFF' rule for blood sugar management?",

                "Phonetics, Frequency, and Fasting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PFF rule (Protein, Fat, Fiber) ensures a slow glucose release into the bloodstream, preventing the spikes and crashes that mimic or exacerbate anxiety/panic symptoms."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "The 'Safe Container' Protocol (Lesson 8) defines boundaries not as 'saying no,' but as:",
            "options": [
                "A way to punish people who cause stress.",
                "The physiological protection of one's limited energy reserves.",
                "A method for avoiding all social contact during recovery.",
                "A cognitive behavioral tool for social anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In burnout recovery, boundaries are viewed through a physiological lens—they are the 'walls' of the container that allow the nervous system to stop scanning for threats and start repairing."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module found that individuals with 'blunted' morning cortisol levels (hypocortisolism) were most likely to experience:",
            "options": [
                "Excessive evening energy.",
                "High levels of inflammatory markers and 'brain fog'.",
                "Rapid weight loss.",
                "Improved resilience to stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blunted cortisol (common in advanced burnout) fails to suppress morning inflammation, leading to the characteristic 'heavy' fatigue and cognitive impairment known as brain fog."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "When working with a client in an acute 'Sympathetic' spike (panic/racing thoughts), which intervention should be used FIRST according to the stabilization hierarchy?",
            "options": [
                "Journaling about the root cause of the stress.",
                "Somatic grounding (e.g., the 5-4-3-2-1 technique).",
                "Setting a long-term career goal.",
                "Challenging the irrational thoughts using CBT."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "You cannot 'reason' with a sympathetic nervous system. You must use 'bottom-up' (body-first) somatic grounding to stabilize the physiology before 'top-down' (cognitive) work can be effective."
