            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Evolve phase is not about 'bouncing back' to an old, unsustainable self, but 'bouncing forward' into a new version of the self that integrates the burnout experience into a sustainable long-term protocol."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic Boundary Architecture moves beyond willpower by creating 'friction'—such as app blockers or automated 'out of office' replies—that protects the client's energy without requiring constant decision-making."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that without a structured protocol like the LTRP, the likelihood of falling back into old 'Over-functioning' patterns is over 60%, as the environmental pressures often remain unchanged."
