            "question": "In the neurobiology of chronic burnout, what phenomenon typically occurs after a prolonged period of hypercortisolism?",
            "options": [
                "Hypocortisolism (blunted HPA axis response)",
                "Permanent elevation of basal cortisol levels",
                "Increased hippocampal volume",
                "Enhanced prefrontal cortex regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress eventually leads to 'burnout' of the HPA axis, resulting in hypocortisolism where the body fails to produce sufficient cortisol to meet daily demands, leading to profound fatigue."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to the differential diagnosis criteria, what is the primary distinction between occupational burnout and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout does not involve sleep disturbances",
                "MDD is context-specific, while burnout is pervasive",
                "Burnout is context-specific (work-related), while MDD is pervasive across all life domains",
                "There is no clinical distinction between the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While symptoms overlap, burnout is fundamentally linked to the occupational context. If the symptoms persist equally across all life domains regardless of work exposure, a diagnosis of MDD is more likely."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) measures burnout across which three specific subscales?",
            "options": [
                "Anxiety, Depression, and Stress",
                "Exhaustion, Cynicism, and Reduced Professional Efficacy",
                "Workload, Control, and Reward",
                "Cognitive Impairment, Physical Fatigue, and Emotional Liability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MBI, the gold standard for assessment, identifies burnout through Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization (Cynicism), and a sense of Low Personal Accomplishment (Reduced Efficacy)."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model, which process is triggered when job demands are high and remain unbuffered by resources?",
            "options": [
                "The Motivational Process",
                "The Engagement Pathway",
                "The Health Impairment Process",
                "The Resource Acquisition Loop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Health Impairment Process describes how chronic job demands exhaust a worker's mental and physical resources, leading to energy depletion and health problems."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Research indicates that which type of perfectionism is most strongly and consistently correlated with high burnout scores?",
            "options": [
                "Self-Oriented Perfectionism",
                "Socially Prescribed Perfectionism",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Socially Prescribed Perfectionism—the belief that others hold unrealistic expectations of you—is the most 'toxic' form because it feels external, uncontrollable, and creates constant performance anxiety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Using Polyvagal Theory to explain somatic manifestations, which state is a client likely in when they describe feeling 'numb,' 'spaced out,' or 'trapped'?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown/Freeze)",
                "The Flow State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the body's last-resort defense mechanism. In late-stage burnout, the system 'shuts down' to conserve energy, resulting in dissociation and physical immobilization."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "What is the psychological function of 'Cynicism' (Depersonalization) within the three-dimensional model of burnout?",
            "options": [
                "It is a sign of a naturally 'difficult' personality",
                "It serves as a dysfunctional coping mechanism to create emotional distance from stressors",
                "It is a direct result of low intelligence",
                "It is a strategy used to gain a promotion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cynicism is an attempt to protect oneself from further emotional exhaustion by withdrawing and creating a 'buffer' between the self and the people or tasks at work."

            "id": "q10_8",

            "options": [
                "Challenging cognitive distortions",
                "Career coaching and job searching",
                "Biological stabilization and nervous system regulation",
                "Assertiveness training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovery cannot begin with high-level cognitive work if the brain is in a state of neurobiological crisis. Stabilization of sleep, nutrition, and the nervous system is the essential first step."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on the JD-R model found that 'Job Resources' have what specific effect on the relationship between demands and burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Resources have no effect on burnout",
                "Resources actually increase stress by adding more tasks",
                "Resources act as a 'buffer,' weakening the impact of high demands on exhaustion",
                "Resources only help if the client is already healthy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resources (like autonomy, feedback, and social support) can mitigate the negative impact of high demands, preventing the Health Impairment Process from taking hold."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client presents with high scores in exhaustion but also high scores in professional efficacy and a 'frenetic' work pace. This profile is often categorized as:",
            "options": [
                "The 'Under-Challenged' subtype",
                "The 'Worn-Out' subtype",
                "The 'Over-Engaged' or 'Frenetic' subtype",
                "Clinical Depression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frenetic burnout types are highly involved and work harder in response to stress, maintaining high efficacy until they eventually reach a point of total systemic collapse."
