            "question": "The R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™ differs from traditional stress management primarily by utilizing which approach?",
            "options": [
                "A symptom-first approach focused on immediate relaxation",
                "A sequential, evidence-based methodology that prioritizes physiological stabilization before cognitive restructuring",
                "A purely psychological approach focused on childhood trauma",
                "A productivity-focused system designed to increase work hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RESTORE Framework™ is built on the 'Bottom-Up' principle, meaning the nervous system must be stabilized (Stabilize) before complex cognitive work (Transform) can be effectively sustained."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "During the 'Recognize' phase (L2), a client scores high on the 'Depersonalization' scale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). What does this clinically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client is simply tired and needs a weekend off",
                "The client has developed a cynical or detached attitude toward their work and clients",
                "The client is experiencing a total loss of motor function",
                "The client has achieved a high level of professional objectivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Depersonalization is one of the three core pillars of burnout in the MBI, characterized by cynicism, detachment, and viewing others as objects rather than people."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3 (Evaluate), 'Identity Fusion' is identified as a primary internal driver of burnout. How is this concept defined?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to balance multiple roles effectively",
                "A state where an individual's self-worth is inextricably tied to their professional performance and output",
                "The process of merging two different corporate cultures",
                "A clinical term for multiple personality disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity Fusion occurs when a client can no longer distinguish their intrinsic value from their extrinsic achievements, making them highly vulnerable to burnout when work performance dips."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Stabilize' protocols (L4), which physiological mechanism is targeted when utilizing extended exhalation breathing?",
            "options": [
                "Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)",
                "Increasing cortisol production to improve alertness",

                "Suppression of the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations (where the exhale is longer than the inhale) stimulate the Vagus nerve, which signals the body to move from 'Fight or Flight' into 'Rest and Digest' (PNS)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "In the 'Transform' phase (L5), what is the primary goal of 'Identity Decoupling'?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client find a new career immediately",
                "To separate the client's sense of self from their professional achievements and failures",
                "To encourage the client to work more hours to prove their worth",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity Decoupling is a cognitive intervention that helps clients build a robust sense of self that is independent of their job title or productivity metrics."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 (Optimize) discusses 'Sustainable High-Performance Structures.' What is the 'Rule of 3' mentioned in this context?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Rule of 3 is a prioritization strategy that protects the 'Prefrontal Cortex' from decision fatigue by limiting daily focus to three critical tasks."

            "id": "q14_7",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Professional Agency is about moving from a state of 'learned helplessness' to a state of 'active choice,' where the client recognizes their power to set boundaries and influence their environment."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 (Evolve), what is a 'Relapse Trigger' in the context of burnout recovery?",
            "options": [
                "A sign that the recovery was a failure",
                "A specific internal or external cue that threatens to return the client to old patterns of over-functioning",
                "A mandatory part of the recovery process that happens to everyone",
                "A pharmacological reaction to anti-anxiety medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relapse triggers are cues (like a specific email tone or a certain time of year) that can pull a client back into 'burnout behaviors' unless they have a pre-planned resilience strategy."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that systemic stressors (Workload, Control, Reward) account for what percentage of burnout variance?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Exactly 100%",
                "Approximately 60-70%",
                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that while individual resilience matters, systemic organizational factors (the environment) account for the majority (60-70%) of burnout variance."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Why does the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™ place 'Somatic Regulation' (L4) before 'Values Alignment' (L7)?",
            "options": [
                "Because values are not important in burnout recovery",
                "Because a dysregulated nervous system lacks the 'Cognitive Bandwidth' to engage in deep values-based reflection",
                "Because somatic work is faster to bill for",
                "Because values alignment is only for the 'Evolve' stage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is in a state of chronic physiological arousal (burnout), their prefrontal cortex is effectively 'offline.' They must be stabilized somatically before they can think clearly enough to align their life with their values."
