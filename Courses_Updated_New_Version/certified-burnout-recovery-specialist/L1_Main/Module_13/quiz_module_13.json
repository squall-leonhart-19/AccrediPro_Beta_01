            "question": "What is the primary differentiator between the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™ and standard self-care protocols?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses exclusively on career transitions and job placement.",
                "It utilizes a sequential, evidence-based approach targeting both physiological regulation and cognitive restructuring.",
                "It prioritizes nutritional supplementation over nervous system regulation.",
                "It is designed only for clinical psychologists and not recovery specialists."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™ is distinguished by its comprehensive, sequential nature that addresses the biological (somatic) and psychological (cognitive) components of burnout systematically."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the 'Recognize (R)' phase, which physiological marker is most indicative of late-stage adrenal exhaustion common in burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Consistently elevated morning cortisol levels.",
                "A 'flattened' diurnal cortisol curve with low morning output.",
                "Increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV) during rest.",
                "Rapid spikes in blood glucose during non-stressful periods."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While early stress involves high cortisol, chronic burnout often leads to a 'flattened' curve where the body can no longer produce sufficient cortisol in the morning, leading to profound fatigue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "During the 'Evaluate (E)' phase, what is the significance of distinguishing between 'Biogenic' and 'Psychogenic' stressors?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to prescribe medication for biogenic stressors.",
                "It helps identify whether the stress is coming from external physiological triggers or internal thought patterns.",
                "Psychogenic stressors are considered 'fake' and should be ignored.",
                "Biogenic stressors are the only stressors that affect the nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective evaluation requires understanding if the stress is physical (caffeine, lack of sleep, noise) or psychological (perfectionism, rumination) to apply the correct intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client in the 'Stabilize (S)' phase presents with chronic 'High-Beta' brainwave activity. Which intervention is most effective for immediate nervous system down-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Intense cardiovascular exercise for 45 minutes.",
                "Cognitive reframing of their work deadlines.",
                "The 'Physiological Sigh' (double inhale, long exhale) to activate the vagus nerve.",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to overcome the 'slump'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stabilization focuses on somatic (body-based) protocols. The physiological sigh is a proven tool to rapidly shift the nervous system from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "The 'Transform (T)' phase introduces 'Worth Decoupling.' What does this concept entail?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout is often fueled by the belief that one is only as valuable as their last achievement. Decoupling worth from work is essential for long-term psychological recovery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Optimize (O)' phase, why is 'Decision Fatigue' a critical factor in burnout recovery?",
            "options": [
                "It suggests that clients should make all major life decisions while burned out.",
                "It proves that the prefrontal cortex has infinite energy for choices.",
                "It demonstrates that every small choice depletes cognitive resources, necessitating automated routines to preserve energy.",
                "It indicates that burnout is caused by a lack of choices."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Optimize focuses on daily structures. By automating low-stakes decisions (like meal planning or morning routines), clients preserve limited cognitive energy for recovery and essential tasks."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In the 'Reclaim (R)' phase, how is 'Values-Aligned Agency' defined?",

                "Reclaiming a former high-stress position after a two-week break."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reclaiming agency involves moving from a reactive state to a proactive state where life choices are driven by personal values, which is protective against future burnout."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is identified in the 'Evolve (E)' phase as a 'Leading Indicator' of relapse?",
            "options": [
                "The client taking a mental health day.",
                "A return to 'Over-functioning' (taking on others' responsibilities) and ignoring physical hunger cues.",

                "Engaging in a new hobby unrelated to work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relapse prevention (Evolve) requires monitoring 'leading indicators'—behaviors like over-functioning that precede the physical collapse of burnout."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in the module regarding burnout and brain morphology found that chronic stress can lead to visible atrophy in which area?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic burnout is associated with thinning or atrophy of the Prefrontal Cortex, which governs executive function, emotional regulation, and impulse control."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Mark' has successfully regulated his nervous system but finds himself falling back into old patterns because he doesn't know 'who he is' without his job. Which phase requires the most focus?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
