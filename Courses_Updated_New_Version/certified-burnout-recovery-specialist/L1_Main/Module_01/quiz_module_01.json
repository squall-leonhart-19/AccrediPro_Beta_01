            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) defines burnout through three specific dimensions: Emotional Exhaustion (energy depletion), Cynicism/Depersonalization (distancing from the job), and Reduced Personal Accomplishment (feeling ineffective)."

            "options": [
                "The amygdala shrinks, leading to a lack of emotional response.",
                "The amygdala remains unchanged while the hippocampus grows.",
                "The amygdala enlarges, leading to heightened emotional reactivity and a constant 'alarm' state.",
                "The amygdala disconnects entirely from the brainstem."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that chronic stress in burnout leads to an enlarged amygdala, which increases emotional sensitivity and triggers the 'fight or flight' response more easily, while the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) thins, reducing executive control."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Burnout symptoms are usually context-specific (related to work/roles), whereas Depression is pervasive across all life domains.",
                "Depression only involves physical fatigue, while Burnout is purely mental.",
                "Burnout always involves suicidal ideation, whereas Depression does not.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As covered in Lesson 6, a primary diagnostic clue is that burnout is initially tied to a specific context (like a job), while clinical depression tends to affect the individual's outlook on all aspects of life regardless of the environment."

            "explanation": "In the RESTORE protocol (Lesson 8), R stands for Reduced Accomplishment (or Inefficacy), which measures the client's perception of their own competence and value in their work."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A blunted CAR, discussed in Lesson 3 (Neurobiology), is a sign of HPA axis dysregulation where the normal morning cortisol spike is absent, leaving the client feeling unrefreshed and sluggish."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 explains that Cynicism/Depersonalization acts as a buffer or 'emotional callus' used to protect the individual from the pain of feeling ineffective or overwhelmed."
