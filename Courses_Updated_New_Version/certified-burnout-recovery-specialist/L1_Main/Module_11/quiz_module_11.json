            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "According to Lesson 1 on Clinical Neurobiology, which structural change is most commonly observed in the brains of individuals suffering from chronic burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Increased volume in the Prefrontal Cortex",
                "Significant atrophy of the Hippocampus and thinning of the PFC",

                "Expansion of the Grey Matter in the Parietal Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids and neuroinflammation leads to hippocampal atrophy and a reduction in Prefrontal Cortex thickness, impairing executive function and emotional regulation."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the 'R' (Advanced Diagnostics) phase, a client who is highly invested, works excessively hard, and ignores their own needs to the point of exhaustion fits which subtype?",
            "options": [
                "The Underchallenged Subtype",
                "The Worn-out Subtype",
                "The Frenetic Subtype",
                "The Existential Subtype"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Frenetic subtype is characterized by individuals who work increasingly harder to overcome obstacles, often neglecting their own health and personal life in the process."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 (Environmental Audit) discusses 'Moral Injury' in the workplace. What defines this specific systemic stressor?",
            "options": [
                "Having too many emails to answer in a day",
                "Working in an office with poor lighting and ergonomics",
                "Being required to perform or witness acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs",
                "Receiving a lower salary than a colleague in the same role"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Moral injury occurs when the work environment forces an individual to act against their core values, leading to a profound sense of psychological and existential distress."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "During the 'Somatic Stabilization' phase (Lesson 4), what is the primary goal for a client currently in a 'Dorsal Vagal' state?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to boost energy",

                "Total sensory deprivation for 48 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dorsal Vagal states represent functional collapse; the goal is to gently reintroduce safety and mobilization without triggering a sympathetic 'fight or flight' spike."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5 (Identity Transformation), what is the clinical significance of 'Performance-Based Self-Esteem' (PBSE)?",
            "options": [
                "It is a healthy motivator for high-achieving professionals",
                "It creates a fragile identity where self-worth is entirely contingent on constant achievement",
                "It is unrelated to burnout risk",
                "It helps individuals recover faster by focusing on goals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PBSE makes an individual highly vulnerable to burnout because any perceived failure in performance is experienced as a total collapse of self-worth."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 (Recovery Optimization) introduces 'Ultradian Rhythms.' What is the recommended 'Golden Ratio' for sustainable high performance?",
            "options": [
                "50 minutes of work followed by 10 minutes of rest",
                "90 minutes of focused work followed by a 15-20 minute physiological break",
                "3 hours of work followed by a 1-hour lunch break",
                "Work until the task is finished, then rest for the remainder of the day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The body operates on ultradian cycles; resting every 90 minutes aligns with natural physiological ebbs in focus and prevents the 'tired but wired' state."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In the 'Existential Reclaim' phase (Lesson 7), how is 'Agency' differentiated from 'Autonomy'?",
            "options": [
                "Agency is the power to act; Autonomy is the freedom from external control",
                "They are synonyms and used interchangeably in burnout recovery",
                "Agency refers only to financial independence",
                "Autonomy is a somatic state, while Agency is a cognitive state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Agency focuses on the client's internal capacity and belief that they can influence their life, while Autonomy focuses on the external environment's lack of restriction."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "The 'Evolve Protocol' (Lesson 8) emphasizes 'Relapse Prevention.' Which indicator suggests a client is entering the 'Warning Zone' of a relapse?",

                "Increased interest in new hobbies",
                "Strict adherence to sleep hygiene",

                "Consistent use of the 'No' boundary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Subtle signs like cynicism, social withdrawal, and the erosion of boundaries (micro-withdrawals) are early clinical markers of a potential burnout relapse."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that 'Job Demands' are less predictive of burnout than 'Resource Inadequacy.' What does this imply for recovery?",
            "options": [
                "We should only focus on reducing the client's workload",
                "Recovery must focus on increasing internal and external resources, not just reducing stress",
                "Clients should quit their jobs immediately",
                "Resources like social support have no impact on neurobiology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The JD-R model suggests that high demands can be tolerated if resources (support, autonomy, tools) are sufficient; recovery must build these resources."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'Gold Standard' for measuring the recovery of the Autonomic Nervous System in burnout clients?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose levels",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Resting Heart Rate (RHR) only",
                "Total Cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV is a non-invasive, highly accurate marker of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, reflecting overall resilience."
