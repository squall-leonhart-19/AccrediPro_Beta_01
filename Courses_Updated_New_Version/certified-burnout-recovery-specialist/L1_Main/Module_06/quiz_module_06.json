                "A state where an individual's self-worth is entirely dependent on their professional role and achievements.",
                "A healthy integration of personal and professional life goals.",
                "The process of networking with high-level professionals to advance a career.",
                "A clinical term for social anxiety developed during chronic stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Identity Enmeshment occurs when the boundaries between the 'self' and the 'job' disappear, making any professional setback feel like a personal existential threat."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to the module, how do core values serve a client during the 'Reclaim' phase?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Core values provide the 'why' behind the 'no.' They act as an internal compass that helps clients align their daily actions with their authentic selves, reducing cognitive dissonance."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",

                "Passive leisure is more expensive than deep play.",
                "Deep play requires a high level of physical fitness.",
                "Deep play involves active engagement and 'flow,' while passive leisure is low-effort consumption.",
                "There is no difference; both are equally effective for burnout recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Deep play (or autotelic activity) involves active engagement, challenge, and the state of 'flow,' which is significantly more restorative for the nervous system than passive consumption like scrolling social media."
        },

            "id": "q6_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relational Energy is the psychological and physiological impact of social interactions. Recovery involves identifying 'energy givers' and limiting time with 'energy vampires.'"

                "It is a temporary measure used only during the first week of recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Values-based boundaries are more sustainable because they are framed as an act of self-respect and alignment with one's identity rather than just a defensive 'no.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is about taking the insights from recovery (values, boundaries, play) and building a new structure for daily life that prevents a return to old, destructive patterns."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Agency Atrophy.' They struggle to make even minor decisions, like what to eat for dinner. What is the best initial coaching intervention?",

                "Make all decisions for the client for the next month.",
                "Assign a high-stakes professional project to 'jumpstart' their brain.",

                "Tell the client to stop being indecisive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rebuilding agency requires starting small. Micro-choices (e.g., choosing a specific tea or a walking route) help the nervous system feel safe exercising control again."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value affirmation acts as a psychological buffer, lowering the neuroendocrine (cortisol) response to stress and allowing the prefrontal cortex to remain engaged."
