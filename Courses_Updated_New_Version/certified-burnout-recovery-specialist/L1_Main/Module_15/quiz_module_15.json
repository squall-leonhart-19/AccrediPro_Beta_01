            "question": "According to the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™ introduced in Lesson 1, what is the primary objective of the first 'S' (Stabilizing) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the root causes of systemic workplace dysfunction",
                "To move the client from a state of sympathetic dominance or dorsal vagal collapse into a regulated ventral vagal state",
                "To begin the process of decoupling self-worth from professional productivity",
                "To implement a high-intensity exercise regimen to boost endorphin production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stabilizing phase focuses on somatic recovery and nervous system regulation, transitioning the client out of 'survival mode' (fight/flight/freeze) before deep cognitive work begins."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the 'Burnout Triad' discussed in Lesson 2, which component is characterized by a cynical, detached response to various aspects of the job?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional Exhaustion",
                "Reduced Personal Accomplishment",
                "Depersonalization",
                "Cognitive Impairment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Depersonalization (or Cynicism) is the second pillar of the Maslach Burnout Triad, representing the interpersonal dimension where the individual distances themselves from their work and clients."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 (Evaluating) differentiates between systemic stressors and internal drivers. Which of the following is classified as an 'Internal Driver'?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of Role Clarity",
                "Unrelenting Standards (Perfectionism)",
                "Insufficient Reward/Recognition",
                "Sustainable Workload Imbalance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the others are systemic (organizational) factors, perfectionism or 'Unrelenting Standards' is an internal cognitive driver that exacerbates burnout regardless of the environment."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "During the 'Stabilizing' phase (Lesson 4), a client presents with 'Dorsal Vagal' dominance. What symptoms are you most likely to observe?",
            "options": [
                "High anxiety, racing heart, and hyper-vigilance",
                "Increased creativity and social engagement",
                "Numbness, dissociation, and a feeling of being 'trapped' or 'frozen'",
                "Aggressive behavior and irritability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Polyvagal Theory, the Dorsal Vagal state is the 'shutdown' response, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and metabolic conservation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5 (Transforming), the concept of 'Performance-Based Self-Esteem' (PBSE) is addressed. What is the core intervention for a client with high PBSE?",
            "options": [
                "Improving time management skills to increase output",
                "Decoupling intrinsic worth from external achievements and productivity",
                "Setting higher goals to prove their competence",
                "Focusing exclusively on physical rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PBSE makes self-worth contingent on success. Recovery requires decoupling that worth from 'doing' and reconnecting it to 'being' and intrinsic values."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 (Optimizing) introduces the 'Recovery-Output Balance.' What does a 2022 meta-analysis suggest about the relationship between micro-breaks and burnout prevention?",
            "options": [
                "Micro-breaks have no significant impact on long-term burnout",
                "Only breaks longer than 60 minutes are effective for cortisol reduction",
                "Short micro-breaks (30-120 seconds) can reduce fatigue and improve vigor by up to 25%",
                "Micro-breaks are only effective if they involve physical exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based recovery strategies emphasize that frequent micro-breaks are highly effective for maintaining the nervous system's 'window of tolerance' throughout the day."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "In the 'Reclaiming' phase (Lesson 7), the focus shifts to Agency and Values. What is the 'Locus of Control' shift required for recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from an Internal Locus to an External Locus",
                "Moving from an External Locus (feeling like a victim of circumstances) to an Internal Locus (taking empowered action)",
                "Accepting that all factors are outside of the client's control",
                "Focusing only on things that cannot be changed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reclaiming agency involves shifting the client toward an internal locus of control, where they recognize their power to set boundaries and make choices aligned with their values."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 (Evolving) focuses on Relapse Prevention. What is the 'Relapse Drift'?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden, traumatic return to full burnout symptoms",
                "The gradual, often unnoticed return to old habits (e.g., skipping breaks, over-committing) that precedes a crash",
                "The period of time it takes for a client to find a new job",
                "A physiological state where cortisol levels remain permanently high"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relapse Drift is the subtle erosion of recovery boundaries. It is often the 'honeymoon phase' of returning to work where a client feels 'cured' and stops practicing their resilience tools."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A client scores high on the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) for 'Reduced Personal Accomplishment' but moderate on 'Exhaustion.' Which phase of the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework™ should be prioritized to address the efficacy deficit?",
            "options": [
                "Stabilizing (S)",
                "Evaluating (E)",
                "Reclaiming (R) - specifically focusing on Values and Agency",
                "Recognizing (R)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reduced personal accomplishment is often tied to a loss of meaning and agency. The Reclaiming phase (L7) focuses on purpose, values, and 'small wins' to rebuild the sense of efficacy."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which specific physiological marker is most associated with the 'Exhaustion' component of the Burnout Triad, as discussed in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and flattened Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)",
                "Increased Alpha brain wave activity",
                "Decreased blood glucose levels",
                "Rapid increase in bone density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Burnout-related exhaustion is clinically linked to HPA-axis dysfunction, frequently manifesting as a flattened CAR and an elevated RHR due to chronic sympathetic activation."
