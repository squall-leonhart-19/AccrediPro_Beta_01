            "question": "In the context of the neurobiology of the 'Fawn' response, which physiological state is most accurately described by Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": [
                "A pure sympathetic 'fight or flight' activation aimed at overpowering the threat.",
                "A dorsal vagal shutdown resulting in total physical immobilization and dissociation.",
                "A hybrid state of high sympathetic arousal masked by social engagement behaviors to appease an aggressor.",
                "A ventral vagal state of relaxation and safety that allows for clear communication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response is a complex 'appeasement' strategy where the individual uses social engagement behaviors (ventral vagal) to manage a high-arousal threat (sympathetic), essentially 'befriending' the predator to survive."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "Anxious-Preoccupied attachment blueprints are often characterized by 'protest behavior.' Which of the following is a clinical example of this behavior in codependent adults?",
            "options": [
                "Withdrawing and going 'silent' for days to avoid conflict.",
                "Excessive calling or texting to re-establish a sense of connection when feeling rejected.",
                "A logical and detached discussion about boundary violations.",
                "Complete indifference to the partner's emotional state or whereabouts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protest behaviors are actions taken by those with anxious attachment to get a response or re-establish proximity with an attachment figure when they feel the connection is threatened."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to systemic dynamics, why does a family system often experience a 'crisis' when the primary caretaker begins to set healthy boundaries?",
            "options": [
                "The family members are inherently malicious and want the caretaker to suffer.",
                "The system is attempting to maintain homeostasis and resists the loss of its 'stabilizer.'",
                "The caretaker is likely setting boundaries in an aggressive and harmful manner.",
                "The family no longer has a way to communicate basic needs like food or shelter."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Family systems seek homeostasis. When the caretaker stops over-functioning, the system feels unbalanced, and other members often use 'change-back' maneuvers to pull the caretaker back into their old role."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "In the Karpman Drama Triangle, what is the primary, often unconscious, payoff for the individual in the 'Rescuer' role?",
            "options": [
                "To receive financial compensation for their help.",
                "To avoid looking at their own problems by focusing on the 'Victim's' needs.",
                "To eventually take over the 'Persecutor' role and exert direct dominance.",
                "To achieve a state of enlightenment and spiritual superiority."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rescuer keeps the Victim dependent to maintain a sense of purpose and to avoid the anxiety or pain associated with their own internal lives."

            "question": "A client states, 'If my husband is unhappy, it must be because I didn't do enough to make the house peaceful today.' Which cognitive distortion is this most indicative of?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personalization involves taking responsibility for external events or other people's emotions that are outside of one's control, a hallmark of codependent internal dialogue."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of 'Covert Control' in the language of codependency?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Covert control relies on manipulation, passive-aggression, or guilt-tripping to influence another person's behavior without making a direct request."

                "The involuntary tensing of the shoulder muscles during confrontation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alexithymia is common in codependency because the individual has spent years suppressing their own needs/feelings to focus on others, leading to a 'disconnect' from their own somatic signals."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "During a clinical assessment, a client acknowledges that their relationship is 'unhealthy' but says, 'I'm just not ready to leave yet; I need to see if they change first.' Which stage of change are they in?",

                "Pre-contemplation",

            "id": "q15_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala processes emotional significance and triggers the survival response (including Fawn) rapidly, often bypassing the rational Prefrontal Cortex."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "When applying the Karpman Drama Triangle clinically, what is the 'Winner's Triangle' equivalent of the 'Victim' role?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Winner's Triangle (Acey Choy), the Victim moves toward becoming 'Vulnerable' (acknowledging feelings without helplessness), the Rescuer becomes 'Caring,' and the Persecutor becomes 'Assertive.'"
