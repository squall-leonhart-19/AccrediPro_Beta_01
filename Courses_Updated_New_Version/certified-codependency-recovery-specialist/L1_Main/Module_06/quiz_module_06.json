            "question": "In the 'Spectrum of Connection,' how is interdependence distinguished from independence?",
            "options": [
                "Independence involves total self-reliance, while interdependence recognizes mutual reliance as a strength.",
                "Independence is the goal of recovery, while interdependence is a secondary stage.",
                "Interdependence requires giving up personal autonomy for the sake of the relationship.",
                "Independence and interdependence are functionally the same in a clinical setting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Interdependence is the 'Middle Way' where individuals maintain their autonomy (unlike codependence) but acknowledge that human connection and mutual support enhance well-being (unlike hyper-independence)."

            "question": "A client performs a 'Reciprocity Audit' and finds they are 'Over-functioning' in 80% of their interactions. According to Lesson 2, what is the most likely emotional outcome of this imbalance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic over-functioning without reciprocal receiving leads to resentment, which serves as a diagnostic signal that the 'Reciprocity Gap' has become unsustainable."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "According to the concept of 'Individuation Within Connection,' what is the 'I-We' balance?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuation is the process of maintaining a clear sense of 'I' (self-identity) within the 'We' (the relationship), preventing the enmeshment typical of codependency."

                "Vulnerability is avoided until the relationship is at least six months old."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'loop' requires a signal of vulnerability followed by a reciprocal signal, creating a bridge of mutual trust and safety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Repair attempts are 'bids' to reconnect during or after conflict, reducing physiological arousal and keeping the focus on connection rather than winning."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interdependence is achieved when the anxious partner learns to soothe their own nervous system and the avoidant partner learns to tolerate and participate in intimacy."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Interdependence involves diversifying support systems (friends, community, professionals) so that the primary relationship is not crushed by the weight of being the 'everything' for a partner."

                "Dependence is a sign of emotional immaturity.",
                "Most people are naturally avoidant and should stay that way."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The paradox is that having a 'secure base' (interdependence) actually provides the confidence needed for individual exploration and autonomy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Codependency recovery often requires learning the 'Receiving' side of reciprocity, as many codependents are 'compulsive givers' who view receiving as a sign of weakness or burden."
