            "options": [
                "A wall is permanent, while a boundary is always temporary.",
                "A boundary acts as a semi-permeable filter for connection, while a wall creates total isolation.",
                "Walls are used for physical protection, while boundaries are only for emotional protection.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Healthy boundaries are semi-permeable; they allow for intimacy and connection while filtering out harm. Walls, conversely, block both the good and the bad, leading to isolation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Energetic boundaries involve protecting your internal emotional reserves. 'Trauma dumping' or emotional flooding without consent is a primary violation of energetic sovereignty."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Enmeshment occurs when the lines between self and other are blurred, leading an individual to feel responsible for another person's internal emotional state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fear, Obligation, and Guilt (F.O.G.) are the three primary emotional drivers that codependent individuals use to manipulate others or feel manipulated into bypassing their own limits."

            "explanation": "Effective limits focus on the speaker's actions and consequences ('I will leave') rather than trying to control the other person's behavior directly or using blaming 'You' statements."

                "The person receiving the boundary will immediately apologize and change.",
                "The person receiving the boundary will temporarily escalate their negative behavior to test the limit.",
                "The client will feel an immediate sense of relief and peace.",
                "The relationship will naturally dissolve without any further conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An extinction burst is a temporary increase in the frequency or intensity of an unwanted behavior when a boundary is first enforced, as the other person attempts to return to the previous status quo."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional reserve refers to the fact that our capacity for empathy and patience is finite. Protecting this reserve is essential for preventing burnout in recovery."

                "The boundary was too strict to begin with.",

                "The client forgot the specific wording of the limit."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inconsistency is the 'kryptonite' of boundaries. If a consequence is only enforced sometimes, the other person is actually 'trained' to persist longer in hopes that this time the boundary won't hold."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Playing the victim is a common form of resistance (Backlash) designed to trigger the client's guilt (F.O.G.) so they will retract the boundary."

            "options": [
                "The consequence must be something you are 100% willing and able to carry out.",
                "The consequence must be severe enough to punish the other person.",
                "The consequence should only be revealed after the third violation.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A boundary is only as strong as its enforcement. If you state a consequence you aren't prepared to follow through on, you undermine your own credibility and the integrity of the limit."
