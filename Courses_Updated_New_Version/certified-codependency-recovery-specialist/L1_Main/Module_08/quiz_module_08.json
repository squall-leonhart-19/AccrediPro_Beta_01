            "question": "What is the primary indicator that a client has transitioned from 'Conditional Self-Trust' to 'Mastery-Level Self-Trust'?",
            "options": [
                "They no longer experience feelings of doubt or fear when making decisions.",
                "They seek professional validation for every boundary they set to ensure it is 'correct.'",
                "They prioritize internal alignment and core values over external approval, even when it causes temporary social friction.",
                "They have successfully removed all 'high-conflict' individuals from their life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery-level self-trust is defined by the ability to remain anchored in one's own truth and values (internal authority) despite external pressure or the 'disapproval' of others."

            "options": [
                "The initial 'Crisis Phase' when the client is highly motivated by pain.",
                "The 'Plateau Phase' when life feels stable and the client begins to relax their maintenance routines.",
                "The 'Education Phase' when the client is learning the terminology of recovery.",
                "The 'Grief Phase' immediately following the end of a toxic relationship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Drift is a subtle return to old patterns that occurs when the 'urgency' of the initial crisis fades. During stable plateaus, clients may stop practicing the daily self-regulation and boundary work that keeps them in recovery."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of sustained recovery, what is the role of the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)?",
            "options": [
                "It triggers the 'fight or flight' response during boundary setting.",
                "It stores the traumatic memories of childhood neglect.",
                "It provides 'top-down' regulation of the amygdala, allowing for emotional modulation and rational decision-making.",
                "It is responsible for the physical sensation of 'butterflies' in the stomach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The vmPFC is critical for executive function and emotional regulation; recovery involves strengthening the neural pathways from the PFC to the amygdala to dampen impulsive, codependent reactions."

            "id": "q8_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a Specialist feels an obsessive need to 'save' or be hyper-available to a client, it signals countertransference. This mirrors the codependent dynamics the client is trying to escape."

                "Cutting off all family members who do not support the recovery journey.",
                "Changing jobs every time a coworker demonstrates codependent traits.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Differentiation is the ability to be 'in' the system but not 'of' the system emotionally—maintaining a clear self-identity while interacting with others."

                "The client's parents finally apologizing for past behavior.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators are internal shifts in behavior and regulation. Increasing the gap between a stimulus and a response (the pause) is a foundational sign of neurobiological recovery."

                "Holding others responsible for their past actions through legal means."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Agency 2.0 is about moving from a passive, victimized state to an active, creative state where the individual focuses on their power to respond to any situation."

            "question": "In the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™, what is the specific objective of the 'Evaluate' (E) step?",
            "options": [
                "To evaluate the other person's childhood trauma to excuse their behavior.",
                "To determine if the relationship is worth saving.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evaluation in RECLAIM involves looking at the internal cost of staying silent (compliance) versus the potential external cost of setting a limit."

            "question": "A client reports feeling 'guilty and physically ill' after setting a firm boundary with a sibling. According to Lesson 8, this is most likely:",
            "options": [
                "A sign that the boundary was too aggressive and should be retracted.",
                "Evidence that the sibling is a 'narcissist.'",
                "A 'Physiological Hangover' or extinction burst that occurs when breaking long-standing neural patterns.",
                "A sign that the client is not yet ready for the RECLAIM method."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The body often reacts with stress signals (the 'guilt' or 'illness') when we break old 'safety' rules (like people-pleasing), even when the new behavior is healthy."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 3 indicates that consistent Vagus Nerve stimulation (Ventral Vagal work) can lead to a ____% reduction in impulsive caretaking behaviors.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 60% reduction in impulsive caretaking is associated with higher vagal tone, as the body feels safe enough to not use 'pleasing' as a survival strategy."
