            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Neurobiology of Caretaking' describes a specific neurochemical loop that reinforces codependent behavior. Which two chemicals are primarily responsible for the 'reward' felt during compulsive caretaking?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin and Cortisol",
                "Dopamine and Oxytocin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'caretaker's high' is driven by Dopamine (the reward/anticipation) and Oxytocin (the bonding/attachment hormone), which together create a powerful biological reinforcement for self-sacrificing behaviors."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 focuses on Identity Reconstruction. Which concept describes the 'Caretaker Persona' that is adopted to survive a dysfunctional environment, often at the expense of the true self?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The False Self is a mask or persona developed in childhood to gain approval or safety, which eventually becomes the dominant identity in codependent adults."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-stakes boundaries involve non-negotiable limits where the violation leads to major consequences, such as ending a relationship or leaving a living situation to preserve one's integrity."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "The 'Agency Shift' in Radical Self-Responsibility (Lesson 5) requires moving from an External Locus of Control to an Internal Locus of Control. What does this shift imply?",

            "options": [
                "Interdependence is a form of enmeshment, while counter-dependency is healthy",
                "Interdependence involves mutual reliance and vulnerability, while counter-dependency is a defensive avoidance of intimacy",
                "There is no difference; they are two terms for the same state",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counter-dependency is often a 'swing' to the opposite extreme of codependency where one refuses all help; Interdependence is the healthy middle ground of being self-sufficient yet open to mutual support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If a practitioner has not resolved their own caretaking urges, they may fall into the 'Rescuer' role in the Drama Triangle, which stunts the client's growth and violates professional boundaries."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Fawning is the 'Appease' or 'Submit' response, where the individual attempts to manage the threat by pleasing the aggressor, a common neurobiological adaptation in codependency."
