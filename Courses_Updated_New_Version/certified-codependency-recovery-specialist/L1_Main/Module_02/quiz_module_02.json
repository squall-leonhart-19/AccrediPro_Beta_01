            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Family Homeostasis is the tendency of a family system to maintain its internal stability and resist change, often through 'counter-moves' when one member tries to heal or change their role."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both are difficult, emotional parentification—where a child must provide emotional support to a parent—is more strongly correlated with adult depression, anxiety, and codependent boundary issues."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response is a survival strategy where the individual seeks safety by appeasing others, abandoning their own needs to mirror the expectations of a perceived threat."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
