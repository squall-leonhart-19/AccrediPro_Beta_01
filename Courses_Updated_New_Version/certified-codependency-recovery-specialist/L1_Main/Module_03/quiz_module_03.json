            "options": [
                "A self-identity that is rooted in personal hobbies and interests.",
                "A psychological state where identity and self-worth are derived primarily from external feedback and others' emotional states.",
                "A healthy boundary-setting technique used in social situations.",
                "The process of projecting one's internal feelings onto a partner."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Externalized Self is a hallmark of codependency where the individual lacks an internal anchor and instead relies on the approval, moods, and needs of others to define their own value and identity."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'False Self Archetype' known as 'The Chameleon' is primarily driven by which survival motivation?",

                "The desire to be the center of attention at all times.",
                "The drive to achieve safety by blending into the expectations of the current environment and suppressing authentic traits.",
                "The urge to punish others for past grievances."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Chameleon archetype survives by hyper-attuning to others and shifting their personality, opinions, and behaviors to match what they believe will ensure acceptance or safety in a given group."

            "id": "q3_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) is central to self-referential processing; strengthening this 'muscle' allows individuals to reference their own internal states rather than relying on the amygdala's fear-based external monitoring."

            "id": "q3_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-Action Discrepancy occurs when a codependent acts against their own values (e.g., lying to cover for a partner) to maintain a relationship, leading to a breakdown in self-integrity and self-esteem."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",

            "options": [
                "Because they are naturally selfish and trying to hide it.",
                "Due to 'Anhedonic Suppression' and a long-term habit of 'self-silencing' to prioritize the needs of others.",
                "Because they have no actual physiological needs.",
                "Because identifying needs requires a high IQ which codependents typically lack."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Years of self-silencing and hyper-focusing on others lead to a functional 'blindness' to one's own internal cues, making the identification of personal needs a skill that must be relearned."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neff's model defines self-compassion as being kind to oneself (Self-kindness), recognizing that suffering is a shared human experience (Common Humanity), and holding emotions in balanced awareness (Mindfulness)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An internal locus of control is characterized by the belief that one has agency over their own life, choices, and emotional responses, regardless of external circumstances."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By noticing her physical sensation (interoception) and pausing to make a choice based on her own capacity rather than external pressure, Maria is exercising her internal locus of control."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "According to research cited in the module, self-compassion is a more stable predictor of mental health than self-esteem because:",
            "options": [
                "Self-compassion is based on self-acceptance during failure, whereas self-esteem often relies on social comparison and 'being better' than others.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Self-esteem is often contingent on success and comparison, making it fragile. Self-compassion provides a stable emotional floor because it is practiced specifically when one feels inadequate or fails."
