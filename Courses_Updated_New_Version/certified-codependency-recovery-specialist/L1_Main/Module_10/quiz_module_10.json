            "question": "In the RECLAIM Framework, what does the 'E' stage (Energetic and Emotional Boundaries) specifically focus on to prevent 'emotional contagion'?",
            "options": [
                "Total isolation from the emotional states of others",
                "Developing the 'Observing Ego' to differentiate between one's own feelings and those of others",
                "Using physical barriers to avoid difficult conversations",
                "Aggressively confronting others about their emotional demands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' stage emphasizes the development of an 'Observing Ego' which allows a recovery specialist to help clients recognize what is 'mine' versus 'thine,' preventing the enmeshment common in codependency."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on 'Roots of Caretaking,' what is the primary distinction between 'Instrumental Parentification' and 'Emotional Parentification'?",
            "options": [
                "Instrumental involves physical tasks; Emotional involves the child acting as the parent's therapist or confidant",
                "Instrumental is always healthy; Emotional is always toxic",
                "Instrumental only occurs in single-parent households; Emotional occurs in all households",
                "There is no clinical distinction between the two in the RECLAIM framework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Instrumental parentification involves the child performing physical household tasks (cooking, cleaning), while emotional parentification is more damaging, requiring the child to provide emotional support or mediation for the parent."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In the 'Core Self' lesson, the concept of 'Self-Silencing' (Jack, 1991) is identified as a primary mechanism of identity loss. What is the clinical indicator that a client is successfully moving past self-silencing?",
            "options": [
                "The client agrees with everything the specialist suggests",
                "The client stops feeling any anxiety during conflict",
                "The client can articulate their needs even when they fear those needs might cause conflict",
                "The client decides to end all existing relationships"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovery from self-silencing is marked by the 'Reclaiming of Voice,' where the client prioritizes internal authenticity over external harmony, even in the face of potential conflict."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When implementing the 'Limits Phase' (L) of the RECLAIM framework, what is the 'Boundary Paradox' that specialists must prepare clients for?",
            "options": [
                "Setting boundaries makes people like you more immediately",
                "Setting healthy boundaries often leads to an initial increase in external resistance or 'extinction bursts' from others",
                "Boundaries are only effective if the other person agrees to them",
                "Boundaries and limits are the same thing and should be used interchangeably"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Boundary Paradox' refers to the fact that as a client gets healthier by setting limits, the system around them often reacts with increased pressure (extinction bursts) to return to the old codependent status quo."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "The 'Agency' (A) phase of recovery focuses on the 'Internal Locus of Control.' A 2022 study cited in the course suggests that clients with an internal locus of control are:",
            "options": [
                "45% less likely to relapse into codependent caretaking patterns",
                "Only successful if they have a strong support group",
                "More likely to become 'counter-dependent' and avoid all intimacy",
                "Less likely to respond to the RECLAIM framework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The transition from an external to an internal locus of control is a key predictor of long-term success, with data showing a significant reduction in relapse rates when agency is reclaimed."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In the context of 'Healthy Interdependence' (I), how does the RECLAIM framework define the 'Giver-Receiver' balance?",
            "options": [
                "A strict 50/50 split of all duties at all times",
                "The specialist should always be the giver",
                "Dynamic reciprocity where both partners are capable of both roles without losing their sense of self",
                "A system where the former codependent becomes the primary receiver to make up for lost time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healthy interdependence is characterized by dynamic reciprocity—the ability for roles to shift based on need while maintaining individual autonomy and avoiding the 'fixed' roles of the codependent drama triangle."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "During the 'Mastery & Maintenance' (M) phase, what is the significance of the '5-Year Neurobiological Threshold' mentioned in the curriculum?",
            "options": [
                "It takes 5 years for the brain to completely forget codependent habits",
                "It is the point where new neural pathways for self-regulation become the 'default' setting",
                "It is the mandatory length of time for a RECLAIM certification",
                "It refers to the time it takes for family-of-origin trauma to be fully erased"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity research suggests that consistent maintenance of new behaviors for approximately 5 years leads to stabilized neural pathways, making healthy boundaries and self-regulation the brain's new 'autopilot.'"

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A specialist is working with 'Sarah,' a client who consistently 'rescues' her adult son from financial crises. In the RECLAIM Toolkit, which intervention is most appropriate for the 'Roots' (R) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Teaching Sarah how to balance a checkbook",
                "A 'Genogram Analysis' to identify patterns of over-functioning in Sarah's maternal line",

                "Encouraging Sarah to go on a vacation alone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Roots' phase is about recognition and origin. A Genogram Analysis helps the client see that their caretaking isn't just a personal flaw, but a multi-generational legacy that they have the power to stop."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Clinical Mirroring' when a specialist is implementing the RECLAIM framework with a client?",
            "options": [
                "To copy the client's body language to build rapport",
                "To show the client their own inherent worth and 'Core Self' that was previously ignored by caregivers",
                "To show the client how bad their behavior looks to others",
                "To provide a script for the client to use with their spouse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical Mirroring in this context is a corrective emotional experience where the specialist reflects the client's true self, providing the validation the client missed during formative family-of-origin years."

            "id": "q10_10",

                "Working with a client who is highly motivated and self-aware",
                "Establishing a clear fee structure and office hours",
                "Experiencing a personal crisis that triggers the 'Helper's High' as a form of avoidance",
                "Attending a professional development seminar on interdependence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specialists are at risk of 'relapse' into over-functioning when their own lives feel out of control; the 'Helper's High' can become a maladaptive coping mechanism to avoid their own emotional pain."
