            "question": "In Lesson 1, how is the 'Modern Model' of codependency distinguished from the traditional 'Addiction Model'?",
            "options": [
                "The modern model focuses exclusively on the partners of alcoholics.",
                "The modern model defines codependency as a dysfunctional relationship with the self, rather than just a reaction to another's substance use.",
                "The modern model suggests codependency is a permanent personality trait that cannot be changed.",
                "The modern model identifies codependency as a purely genetic condition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern clinical perspectives have shifted from viewing codependency solely through the lens of chemical dependency to seeing it as a primary disorder of the self and relational boundaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Fawn' response is a survival strategy where an individual attempts to avoid conflict or harm by placating, mirroring, and anticipating the needs of a perceived threat or authority figure."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client states, 'I can't be happy if my partner is having a bad day at work. I feel their stress in my own body until they feel better.' This is a hallmark symptom of which concept?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Enmeshment involves blurred emotional boundaries where an individual's sense of well-being is entirely dependent on and fused with the emotional state of another."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rescuers often fix others to maintain a sense of value and control, frequently using the 'help' as a defense mechanism against addressing their own unresolved issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Codependents often exist in a state of high sympathetic nervous system arousal, manifesting as 'bracing' in the gut and chest as they scan for shifts in others' moods."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Placating is a communication style used to avoid conflict at all costs by devaluing one's own needs and agreeing with others to keep the peace."

                "To diagnose family members with specific personality disorders.",
                "To prove to the client that they are the victim in every situation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The inventory is a tool for self-discovery, allowing the client to see patterns of codependency objectively before moving into the 'Release' and 'Rebuild' phases."

            "id": "q1_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Codependency is often linked to poor interoception; because the focus is so heavily external, the individual loses the ability to accurately 'read' their own body's signals and needs."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which statement best reflects the 'Rescuer-to-Victim' shift often seen in codependent relationships?",
            "options": [
                "The Rescuer becomes so successful that the Victim gets jealous.",
                "The Rescuer eventually feels resentful and unappreciated when their 'help' doesn't work, eventually feeling like the one being mistreated.",
                "The Victim becomes the Rescuer's therapist.",
                "The Rescuer leaves the relationship as soon as the Victim gets better."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Karpman Triangle, roles are fluid. When a Rescuer's efforts are rejected or fail to produce change, they often shift into the Victim role, feeling 'burned out' or 'used.'"
