        {
            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of the codependent response, which neurotransmitter is primarily associated with the 'compulsive' nature of caretaking, functioning similarly to an addiction cycle?",
            "options": ["Serotonin", "Dopamine", "GABA", "Melatonin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine drives the reward-seeking behavior in codependency; the 'fix' of helping or being needed triggers a dopamine release, creating a cycle of compulsion similar to chemical dependency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to Advanced Attachment Theory, what characterizes the 'Enmeshed' dynamic in adult relationships?",
            "options": ["A complete lack of emotional responsiveness", "A rigid boundary where no information is shared", "A blurring of psychological boundaries where one person's emotions dictate the other's", "A healthy balance of autonomy and connection"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Enmeshment is defined by the loss of individual autonomy and the blurring of psychological boundaries, leading to emotional contagion where one person's state dominates the system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary indicator of 'Pathological Altruism' as opposed to healthy empathy?",
            "options": ["Feeling sad when a friend is hurting", "Donating a manageable amount of money to charity", "Providing help that ultimately harms the recipient by enabling destructive behavior", "Setting a boundary when a request is unreasonable"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pathological altruism occurs when the 'help' provided has negative consequences for the recipient (enabling) or causes significant self-harm to the giver."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "In the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™, what does the 'C' stand for, and what is the practitioner's goal during this phase?",
            "options": ["Challenge: Confronting the partner's bad behavior", "Center: Returning to the self and regulating the nervous system", "Calculate: Determining the financial cost of the relationship", "Commit: Making a vow never to help again"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'C' stands for Center. This phase focuses on self-regulation and grounding to move out of a reactive 'fawn' state before taking further action."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "A client frequently describes 'triangulation' in their family. According to family systems theory, why does this occur?",
            "options": ["To improve communication between all three parties", "To reduce the tension between two people by pulling in a third party", "To ensure everyone's opinion is heard equally", "To facilitate a healthy intervention"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation is a defensive maneuver used to stabilize a high-tension dyad (two people) by involving a third person to deflect or dilute the anxiety."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Winnicott's concept of the 'False Self' in codependency is best described as:",
            "options": ["A deliberate attempt to manipulate others for financial gain", "A mask of compliance developed to ensure safety and connection in an unstable environment", "A symptom of a narcissistic personality disorder", "A temporary mood swing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The False Self is a protective architecture of compliance. It is developed in childhood to meet the needs of the caregiver, thereby ensuring the child's survival and attachment."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Defensive caretaking is considered a 'survival strategy' because it allows the individual to:",
            "options": ["Gain total control over their environment", "Avoid their own internal feelings of shame by focusing on others", "Heal the other person completely", "Build a high-income career"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Defensive caretaking serves as an avoidant strategy; by focusing entirely on the needs and crises of others, the individual avoids facing their own deep-seated shame and trauma."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "What is the defining characteristic of 'Interdependence' compared to 'Codependence'?",

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Research on the HPA axis in chronically codependent individuals shows that long-term 'allostatic load' can lead to which physiological change?",
            "options": ["Increased bone density", "Hyper-responsiveness to stress (lower threshold for triggers)", "Lowered heart rate in stressful situations", "Enhanced short-term memory"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress from codependent dynamics keeps the HPA axis activated, leading to a state of hyper-vigilance where the individual becomes increasingly sensitive to even minor stressors."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client is at the 'Evaluate' stage of the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™. Which question should they be asking themselves?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Evaluate' stage is about assessing the impact and 'cost' of the codependent behavior on the individual's own life, health, and well-being."
