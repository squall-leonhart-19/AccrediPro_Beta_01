            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is released during the 'rescue' phase of caretaking, creating a neurobiological reward loop that reinforces the fixer identity despite negative long-term consequences."
