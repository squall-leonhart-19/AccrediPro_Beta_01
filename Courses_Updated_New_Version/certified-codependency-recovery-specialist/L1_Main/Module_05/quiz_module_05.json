            "options": [
                "Control is about influencing others; Agency is the internal capacity to direct one's own life.",
                "Control is a healthy boundary, while Agency is a symptom of hyper-independence.",
                "Agency is about managing external circumstances, while Control is about managing emotions.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical settings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Agency is an internal locus of power focused on self-direction, whereas control is often an external focus used to manage anxiety by influencing others' behaviors."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Language shapes reality; moving from 'have to' (obligation/victimhood) to 'choose to' (agency/ownership) reinforces the client's power to make decisions."
