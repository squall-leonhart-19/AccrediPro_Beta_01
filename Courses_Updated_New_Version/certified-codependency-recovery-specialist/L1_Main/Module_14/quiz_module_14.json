            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Examine' phase is dedicated to looking backward at family-of-origin dynamics, identifying roles (like the Hero or Scapegoat), and understanding how early attachment wounds influence current codependent behaviors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fawning is a complex survival strategy where the individual remains hyper-vigilant (sympathetic) but uses social engagement as a 'mask' to appease a perceived threat, rather than being in a truly safe Ventral Vagal state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
