            "options": [
                "Administrative focuses on organizational policy and productivity, while clinical focuses on the specialist-client dynamic and therapeutic efficacy.",
                "Administrative focuses on the specialist's mental health, while clinical focuses on billing and insurance compliance.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms are used interchangeably in codependency recovery settings.",
                "Clinical supervision is only required for junior specialists, while administrative is for senior staff."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clinical supervision is specifically designed to enhance the specialist's skills and ensure client safety through the examination of the therapeutic relationship, whereas administrative supervision deals with the logistical and policy-driven aspects of employment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel Process occurs when the dynamics present in the specialist-client relationship are unconsciously mirrored in the supervisor-specialist relationship."

                "Maintaining strict session start and end times.",
                "Feeling a sense of personal failure or intense guilt when a client relapses into codependent patterns.",
                "Encouraging the client to develop their own support network outside of sessions.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rescuer' takes on the emotional burden of the client's progress, leading to over-responsibility and a blurred boundary where the specialist's self-worth is tied to the client's 'success'."

                "Evaluation; to determine the client's current stage of change and recovery progress.",
                "Externalization; to help the specialist separate the client's identity from their codependent behaviors.",
                "Evidence; to ensure the specialist is using only CBT-based interventions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Externalization (E) in the RECLAIM framework is vital for specialists to view the codependency as a set of behaviors or a 'system' rather than the client's inherent identity, reducing stigma and improving objectivity."

                "It models a healthy, non-hierarchical relationship where the specialist feels safe to admit mistakes.",
                "It ensures the specialist likes the supervisor, which prevents ethical complaints.",
                "It is not a tool; supervisors should never show vulnerability to maintain authority."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By modeling appropriate vulnerability, the supervisor creates a 'secure base' that allows the specialist to be honest about their countertransference and errors, which is essential for professional growth."

                "The physical structure of the recovery center."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding is a developmental mentoring technique where support is tailored to the mentee's current level and reduced as they demonstrate mastery and confidence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Without a strong facilitator, peer groups can fall into 'groupthink,' where they avoid challenging one another's perspectives, leading to missed clinical insights or the reinforcement of the specialist's biases."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Isolation is a primary driver of burnout; peer-supervision and regular consultation provide the necessary emotional outlet and cognitive reframing to maintain long-term mastery."

            "question": "A specialist is working with a high-conflict couple and feels 'paralyzed' during sessions. In supervision, the supervisor also feels 'paralyzed' and unable to offer advice. This is a clear indicator of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The supervisor's feeling of paralysis is a clinical 'clue' that mirrors the specialist's experience with the client, which in turn mirrors the client's own internal or relational state."
