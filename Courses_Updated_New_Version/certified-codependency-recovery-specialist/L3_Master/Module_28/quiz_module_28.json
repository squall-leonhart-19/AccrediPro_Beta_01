            "question": "During the 'Crisis Triage' phase (Lesson 1), what is the primary objective before any deep-dive recovery work can begin?",
            "options": [
                "Identifying the childhood roots of the codependency",
                "Establishing immediate physical safety and emotional stabilization",
                "Constructing a detailed family-of-origin genogram",
                "Implementing a strict no-contact rule with the primary enabler"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization and safety assessment must precede therapeutic processing. In a crisis, the Specialist must ensure the client is not at risk of self-harm, domestic violence, or acute medical emergency before addressing behavioral patterns."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'The Addiction Double-Bind' (Lesson 2), why is a partner's relapse particularly destabilizing for a codependent individual?",
            "options": [
                "It creates a 'lose-lose' scenario where both helping and detaching feel like moral failures",
                "It causes a sudden drop in the codependent's own serotonin levels",
                "It usually leads to immediate financial bankruptcy",
                "It proves that the codependent's 'fixing' strategies were actually working"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Double-Bind' refers to the psychological trap where the codependent feels that 'helping' enables the addiction, but 'detaching' feels like an abandonment of a loved one in a life-threatening state."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on High-Conflict Dynamics, what is the core mechanism of the 'Caretaker Trap' when dealing with a partner who has a Personality Disorder?",
            "options": [
                "The Caretaker becomes the primary breadwinner for the family",
                "The Caretaker accepts the role of 'emotional regulator' for the disordered partner",
                "The Caretaker uses legal threats to maintain control of the relationship",
                "The Caretaker mirrors the symptoms of the disordered partner to gain sympathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Caretaker Trap involves the codependent taking on the impossible task of managing the volatile emotions and behaviors of a partner with high-conflict personality traits, often at the expense of their own reality."

            "id": "q28_4",

                "Melatonin",
                "Dopamine",
                "Estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement (the cycle of tension, explosion, and 'honeymoon' reconciliation) triggers dopamine spikes similar to gambling, creating a powerful physiological addiction to the relationship cycle."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In 'Medical Enmeshment' (Lesson 5), how is the 'Martyr Complex' typically expressed by the caregiver?",
            "options": [
                "By seeking second opinions from multiple doctors",
                "By refusing to follow the doctor's prescribed treatment plan",
                "By deriving their entire sense of worth and identity from the 'burden' of caregiving",
                "By delegating all caregiving tasks to professional nurses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Martyr Complex occurs when a caregiver unconsciously relies on the patient's illness to feel needed, often rejecting help and neglecting their own health to maintain the status of the 'selfless sufferer.'"

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key sign of 'Financial Enabling' as discussed in Lesson 6?",

                "Creating a strict household budget that both partners follow"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Financial enabling involves 'cushioning' the other person from the consequences of their actions (like bailing them out of jail or paying gambling debts), which prevents the crisis necessary for them to seek change."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 identifies 'Object Loss' as a unique component of codependent grief. What does this term refer to?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In codependency, the partner often functions as an 'external regulator' or a 'project.' When the relationship ends, the codependent grieves not just the person, but the loss of the purpose that person provided for their identity."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "What is the primary distinction between 'Vicarious Trauma' and 'Burnout' for a Recovery Specialist (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is caused by the client; Vicarious Trauma is caused by the employer",
                "Burnout is related to workload; Vicarious Trauma involves a shift in the Specialist's worldview due to exposure to client trauma",
                "Vicarious Trauma only happens to new Specialists; Burnout only happens to veterans",
                "There is no distinction; they are two names for the same condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout is a state of physical/emotional exhaustion from work stress. Vicarious Trauma is a profound shift in the Specialist's perception of the world (e.g., feeling the world is no longer safe) after hearing traumatic narratives."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Disenfranchised Grief' after leaving an abusive partner. This means their grief is:",
            "options": [
                "Not recognized or validated by society because the relationship was viewed as 'bad'",
                "So severe that it requires immediate hospitalization",
                "Fake or performative to gain attention",
                "Related only to the loss of financial status"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief is grief that is not socially sanctioned. Friends and family may say, 'Why are you sad? He was terrible to you!', which prevents the survivor from properly processing the genuine loss they feel."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "If a Specialist discovers a client is currently being stalked by an ex-partner, what is the most appropriate 'Scope of Practice' action (Lesson 8)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active stalking is a high-risk safety issue. The Specialist must prioritize safety and refer to specialized IPV/legal experts, as providing tactical safety or legal advice may fall outside their professional scope."
