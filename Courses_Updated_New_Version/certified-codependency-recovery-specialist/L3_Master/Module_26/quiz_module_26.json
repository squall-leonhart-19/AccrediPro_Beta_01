            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1 regarding Program Architecture, what is the primary reason for utilizing a 'Phase-Based' structural model rather than a linear task list?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the Specialist to charge higher fees for each phase completed.",
                "It prevents cognitive overload by anchoring recovery in physiological and psychological safety before moving to deep trauma work.",
                "It ensures that all clients graduate from the program at the exact same time.",
                "It is a legal requirement for all certification programs in North America."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase-based architecture ensures that foundational stability (safety and stabilization) is established before attempting high-intensity interventions, which reduces the risk of client retraumatization and dropout."

                "Assertiveness Training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the RECLAIM Method™, 'A' stands for Alignment, specifically focusing on helping the client align their daily behaviors and boundaries with their newly discovered core values."

        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During the Intake and Screening process (Lesson 3), which of the following is considered an absolute 'Red Flag' that requires immediate referral rather than enrollment in a recovery program?",
            "options": [
                "The client reports feeling 'stuck' in their current marriage.",
                "The client expresses a desire to improve their self-esteem.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specialists must screen for clinical issues that fall outside their scope of practice. Active addiction or acute crisis requires clinical stabilization before codependency coaching can be effective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Based on Tuckman’s Stages, the Storming phase involves participants testing the Specialist's authority and clashing as they establish their roles within the group hierarchy."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Process metrics (e.g., attendance rates) track engagement, while Outcome metrics (e.g., scores on a Codependency Scale) track the program's actual efficacy in creating change."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
