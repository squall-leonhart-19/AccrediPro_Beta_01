            "question": "In the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Diagnostic Framework, what is the primary focus of the 'E' (Etiological Root Analysis) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Establishing immediate physical boundaries with the enmeshed partner",
                "Identifying the specific developmental trauma and attachment wounds that birthed the codependent adaptation",
                "Evaluating the client's current financial and social resources for recovery",
                "Engaging the client in cognitive reframing of their current relationship status"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' in R.E.C.L.A.I.M. stands for Etiological Root Analysis, which involves deep-diving into the developmental origins and attachment history to understand why the codependent patterns formed."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "A practitioner begins to feel an intense, parental urge to 'save' a client who is consistently failing to set boundaries. According to Lesson 2, this is an example of:",

                "Objective Countertransference",
                "Positive Transference",
                "Subjective Countertransference",
                "Parallel Process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Subjective countertransference occurs when the practitioner's own unresolved history or 'shadow' is triggered by the client, leading to an emotional reaction (like the 'Rescuer' impulse) that belongs to the practitioner, not the client."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Neurobiologically, the 'Fawn' response is characterized by the unique co-activation of which two systems?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex and the Cerebellum",
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System (Hyperarousal) and the Parasympathetic System (Dissociation/Freeze)",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex and the Enteric Nervous System",
                "The HPA Axis and the Thyroid Gland exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response is a complex 'hybrid' state where the body is mobilized for fight/flight (Sympathetic) but simultaneously uses social engagement and submission (Parasympathetic/Freeze elements) to appease a threat."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "When facilitating a codependency recovery group, the practitioner notices a member consistently taking on the 'Group Rescuer' role. What is the most effective Master Practitioner intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Removing the member from the group to protect other participants",
                "Publicly praising the member for being so helpful and supportive",
                "Gently pointing out the pattern and asking the member what they are feeling internally when they try to fix others",
                "Ignoring the behavior to avoid shaming the member"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In group dynamics, the 'Rescuer' role is a manifestation of codependency. The practitioner should facilitate 'Interdependent' dynamics by helping the member connect their external 'fixing' behavior to their internal emotional state."

                "Encourage the 'Victim' to vent about the 'Persecutor' for as long as necessary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triangulation is broken when the third party (the practitioner) refuses to be pulled into the 'middle' or used as a messenger, instead directing the parties to communicate with each other directly and transparently."

            "id": "q24_6",

                "Sharing personal trauma history to show the client that the practitioner is also 'broken'",
                "Accepting a high-value gift from a client to avoid hurting their feelings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A boundary 'crossing' is a benign deviation from the strict frame that is clinically justified and intended to enhance the therapeutic alliance, whereas a 'violation' is harmful or exploitative."

            "question": "Integrating R.E.C.L.A.I.M. with Internal Family Systems (IFS) involves identifying 'Manager' parts. In a codependent client, these Managers typically focus on:",

                "Processing deep somatic releases of trauma",
                "Actively seeking out conflict to prove their strength"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In IFS, Managers are proactive protective parts. In codependency, these parts use caretaking, people-pleasing, and hyper-vigilance (Managers) to keep the client's underlying wounds (Exiles) from being triggered."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "What is 'Parallel Process' in the context of Master Practitioner supervision?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner and supervisor both seeing the same client",

                "The practitioner working on two different modules at the same time",
                "The client's recovery timeline matching the practitioner's professional growth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel process occurs when the dynamics present in the client-practitioner relationship are unconsciously replicated in the practitioner-supervisor relationship, providing valuable diagnostic data."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "According to the neurobiological interventions discussed in Lesson 3, why is 'Co-Regulation' essential for a client in a Fawn state?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client is unable to follow verbal instructions",
                "Because the client's nervous system needs a 'safe anchor' to signal that submission is no longer required for survival",
                "Because the practitioner needs to demonstrate that they are the dominant figure",
                "Because it increases the client's cortisol levels to help them fight back"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fawning is a survival strategy based on perceived threat. Co-regulation uses the practitioner's regulated nervous system to signal safety to the client's Vagus nerve, allowing the client to move out of the submissive state."

            "options": [
                "The ability to ignore a client's pain so it doesn't affect the practitioner",
                "The practitioner's personal growth and empowerment resulting from witnessing their clients' triumphs and recovery",
                "A state of burnout where the practitioner feels they have already 'seen it all'",
                "The client's ability to recover only when the practitioner is present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious resilience is the positive counterpart to vicarious trauma; it is the process by which practitioners are transformed and strengthened by the resilience they witness in their clients."
