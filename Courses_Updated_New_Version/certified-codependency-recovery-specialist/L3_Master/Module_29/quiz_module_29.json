            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Architecture of Mastery' is defined by an 'Unshakeable Self.' What is the primary indicator that a specialist has achieved this state?",
            "options": [
                "The total absence of codependent thoughts or impulses in all relationships",
                "An internal locus of control that remains stable despite external relational fluctuations",
                "The ability to control the emotional responses of others during conflict",
                "A complete detachment from all emotional needs and desires"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery is not the absence of impulses, but the development of an internal locus of control that prevents external events from destabilizing the core self."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Neurobiological Stability, what does staying within the 'Window of Tolerance' allow a recovering individual to do?",
            "options": [
                "Suppress all negative emotions through sheer willpower",
                "Enter a state of 'functional freeze' to avoid conflict",
                "Process emotions cognitively without being overwhelmed or shutting down",
                "Bypass the prefrontal cortex to access primal survival instincts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the zone where a person can effectively process and integrate emotional information without falling into hyper-arousal (anxiety/panic) or hypo-arousal (dissociation/numbness)."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "When navigating 'High-Stakes Boundary Integration' (Lesson 3), what is the core function of the 'Boundary Vault' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To hide one's true feelings from others to prevent manipulation",
                "To create a physical barrier between the specialist and the client",
                "To preserve personal integrity and resources while resisting the 'rescue' impulse during crises",
                "To legally document every interaction to avoid professional liability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Boundary Vault is a metaphorical space where one's values and resources are protected, ensuring that high-stakes situations don't trigger a return to 'rescuer' behaviors."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the 'Interdependence Audit.' What is the key differentiator between 'Healthy Support' and 'Enabling'?",
            "options": [
                "Support involves giving money; enabling involves giving time",
                "Support empowers the other's agency; enabling absorbs their consequences",
                "Support is always requested; enabling is always unsolicited",
                "There is no difference; they are two sides of the same coin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Interdependence Audit emphasizes that healthy support helps the other person grow in their own agency, whereas enabling removes the natural consequences of their actions, hindering growth."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "In the context of 'Professional Integration' (Lesson 5), why is clinical supervision essential for a Specialist who notices they have a 'need to be liked' by a client?",
            "options": [
                "Because it indicates a breach of the law",
                "To ensure the Specialist gets higher ratings from the client",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'need to be liked' is a common form of countertransference that can lead to 'people-pleasing' boundaries, which must be addressed in supervision to maintain ethical standards."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 on 'Breaking Generational Legacies' introduces the concept of 'Ancestral Burden.' How is this legacy 'broken' in the Mastery phase?",
            "options": [
                "By cutting off all contact with family members permanently",
                "By consciously decoupling current behaviors from inherited trauma responses",
                "By demanding that previous generations apologize for their behavior",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breaking the legacy involves the conscious awareness and decoupling of one's own choices from the automatic, inherited patterns of previous generations."

            "options": [
                "A slip is intentional; a slide is accidental",
                "A slip involves others; a slide is a solo event",
                "A slip is a momentary lapse; a slide is a progressive return to old patterns",
                "There is no distinction; both require starting recovery over from day one"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A slip is a minor, temporary lapse in boundaries or self-regulation, while a slide is a more significant, ongoing regression into old codependent dynamics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intentionality is the hallmark of the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. life, where actions are driven by conscious values rather than reactive patterns."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis mentioned in the module suggests that 'Mastery' in recovery is highly correlated with 'Vagal Tone.' What does high vagal tone statistically predict?",
            "options": [
                "Lower intelligence scores but higher empathy",
                "Increased resilience and faster recovery from emotional triggers",
                "A total lack of physical stress symptoms",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vagal tone is a biological marker of the parasympathetic nervous system's ability to regulate the heart and emotions, correlating with faster physiological recovery from stress."

                "Intervene directly with the family member to resolve the conflict",
                "Provide the client with a loan to stabilize their financial situation",
                "Maintain the Specialist-client boundary and focus on the client's internal regulation",
                "Assume the role of a legal mediator for the family"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires the Specialist to stay within their scope, focusing on the client's regulation and choices rather than becoming an active participant in the client's external family drama."
