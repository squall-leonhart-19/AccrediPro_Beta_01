            "question": "A client begins sharing detailed, intrusive memories of childhood sexual abuse that they have never processed before. According to the 'Scope of Practice' guidelines, what is the most ethical response for a Recovery Specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Deep-dive into the trauma to help the client find 'closure' through emotional release.",
                "Immediately stop the session and tell the client you can no longer work with them.",
                "Acknowledge the disclosure with empathy and refer the client to a licensed trauma therapist while clarifying that coaching focuses on current behavioral patterns.",
                "Provide the client with a diagnosis of PTSD and suggest a supplement regimen for anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovery coaching is future-oriented and focuses on behavioral patterns. Deep trauma processing or diagnosing clinical conditions like PTSD falls under the scope of licensed psychotherapy."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "In the context of codependency recovery, what is the primary danger of the 'Savior Countertransference'?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the coach too expensive for the client to afford.",
                "It mirrors the client's codependent dynamics by having the coach 'rescue' the client, preventing the client's self-efficacy.",
                "It leads to the coach becoming too distant and cold toward the client.",
                "It results in the coach asking for too many referrals from the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Savior countertransference occurs when the coach feels a pathological need to 'fix' or 'rescue' the client. This reinforces the client's belief that they are helpless and need an external savior, which is the very cycle recovery aims to break."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A client owns a successful marketing firm and offers to manage the coach's social media accounts for free in exchange for extra coaching sessions. Why is this considered an unethical dual relationship?",
            "options": [
                "Because the coach should always get paid in cash, not services.",
                "Because it creates a power imbalance and 'professional enmeshment' that can cloud clinical judgment and boundaries.",
                "Because marketing services are worth more than coaching sessions.",
                "It is actually ethical as long as both parties sign a written agreement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships, such as bartering professional services, create enmeshment. If the coach is unhappy with the marketing work, it may negatively affect the coaching relationship, and the client may feel they cannot be honest in sessions."

        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "In the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Framework for informed consent, what does the 'L' represent?",

                "Limits of the Relationship",
                "Logistics of Scheduling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'L' in R.E.C.L.A.I.M stands for Limits of the Relationship, which defines boundaries regarding contact between sessions, social media interaction, and the duration of the professional bond."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios constitutes a 'Mandatory Reporting' situation for a Recovery Specialist in most jurisdictions?",
            "options": [
                "A client admits they are cheating on their spouse.",
                "A client reveals they have been using alcohol occasionally against their recovery plan.",

                "A client mentions they are unhappy with their current employer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality is not absolute. Ethical and legal standards require reporting when there is a 'duty to warn' regarding an imminent threat of harm to self or others, or suspected abuse of children or elders."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "When working with a client from a collectivistic culture, how should a Specialist approach the concept of 'Enmeshment'?",
            "options": [
                "Insist that the client move out of their family home immediately to gain independence.",
                "Recognize that what looks like 'codependency' in Western psychology may be culturally valued 'interdependence' and adjust goals accordingly.",
                "Inform the client that their culture is fundamentally 'unhealthy' and must be abandoned for recovery.",
                "Ignore cultural factors entirely and use the same template for every client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural competence requires understanding that Western definitions of codependency often prioritize individualism. In many cultures, high levels of family involvement are healthy and expected; the coach must distinguish between cultural loyalty and pathological self-sacrifice."

        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "According to research on Compassion Fatigue, what is a primary symptom that distinguishes it from simple 'Burnout'?",

                "Wanting to ask for a raise.",
                "Focusing too much on administrative tasks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout is general exhaustion related to workload, Compassion Fatigue (often called Secondary Traumatic Stress) specifically involves the erosion of the coach's ability to empathize due to repeated exposure to client trauma."

        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "A Specialist realizes after six sessions that the client has a severe, active Eating Disorder that was not disclosed during intake. What is the most ethical 'Referral Protocol'?",
            "options": [
                "Continue coaching but tell the client to 'eat more' during sessions.",
                "End the relationship immediately via text to avoid further liability.",
                "Explain that the condition requires specialized clinical care and facilitate a 'warm handoff' to an ED specialist while pausing coaching.",
                "Ignore the eating disorder and focus only on the client's relationship with their mother."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active, life-threatening clinical conditions like Eating Disorders require specialized medical and psychological intervention. Ethical referral involves explaining the need for higher care and ensuring the client has a path to get it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Monitoring a client's personal life outside of professional hours is a sign of enmeshment and a boundary violation, indicating the coach has lost professional objectivity."

            "options": [
                "When the client consistently fails to do the work and no progress is being made after addressing the issue.",

                "When a client asks too many questions about the coach's credentials.",
                "When the coach wants to start dating the client's sibling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Termination is ethical when the client is no longer benefiting from the service, provided it is handled transparently, discussed in advance, and referrals are offered to prevent the feeling of abandonment."
