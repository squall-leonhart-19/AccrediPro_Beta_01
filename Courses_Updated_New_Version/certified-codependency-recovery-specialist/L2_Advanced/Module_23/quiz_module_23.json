            "question": "In Somatic Integration for boundary resilience, what is the primary purpose of identifying the 'Felt Sense'?",
            "options": [
                "To intellectually analyze why a boundary was crossed",
                "To recognize the physiological precursors to a boundary violation before cognitive awareness",
                "To suppress the nervous system's response to conflict",
                "To mirror the body language of the person violating the boundary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Felt Sense' allows a client to recognize physical cues (constriction, heat, or tension) that signal a boundary threat, enabling them to respond before they are cognitively overwhelmed or go into a fawning response."

                "To provide the core 'Self' with unconditional compassion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managers are proactive parts that drive codependent behaviors like caretaking and people-pleasing to ensure the individual is never rejected, thereby protecting the vulnerable 'Exile' parts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grey Rocking aims to starve the high-conflict individual of 'narcissistic supply' (emotional reactions) by becoming as boring and non-reactive as a grey rock."

            "id": "q23_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The unpredictability of affection in an abusive relationship triggers massive dopamine spikes when the 'reward' (kindness) finally occurs, creating a powerful neurochemical addiction to the abuser."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "Intuition is always loud and demanding",
                "Hyper-vigilance feels like a neutral 'knowing', while intuition feels like panic",
                "Hyper-vigilance is rooted in past-oriented fear and contraction; Intuition is a present-centered 'knowing' or expansion",
                "There is no functional difference between the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyper-vigilance is a survival mechanism characterized by a tight, scanning, fearful energy. Intuition is typically a calm, clear, and expansive sense of 'truth' that does not require a state of high arousal."

                "A result of poor shadow integration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma bonds create physiological dependencies. When the bond is broken, the brain undergoes a withdrawal process similar to quitting a drug, involving real physical and psychological distress."
