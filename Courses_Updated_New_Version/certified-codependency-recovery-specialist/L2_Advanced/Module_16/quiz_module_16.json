            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Caretaker’s Dilemma involves the deep-seated guilt and 'invisible loyalties' that prevent an individual from individuating because they feel it betrays the family's survival rules."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement creates a powerful biochemical bond (dopamine/oxytocin) that makes the victim crave the 'good' phases, making the relationship as addictive as a substance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Recovery Paradox highlights that 'helping' in a codependent way actually hinders the addict's recovery by softening the 'rock bottom' experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parentification occurs when the functional roles are reversed, and the child is forced to manage the parent's emotional needs, stunting the child's own development."

            "explanation": "Recovery involves 'sitting with' the guilt of breaking enmeshed cultural or family rules rather than reacting to the guilt by reverting to old patterns."
