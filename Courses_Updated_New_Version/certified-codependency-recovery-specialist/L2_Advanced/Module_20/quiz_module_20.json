            "question": "In the RECLAIM Assessment Framework, what does the 'Agency' (A) component specifically evaluate?",
            "options": [
                "The client's ability to set physical boundaries",
                "The shift from an external to an internal locus of control",
                "The history of childhood trauma and attachment styles",
                "The frequency of 'Rescuer' behaviors in the Drama Triangle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Agency' component of the RECLAIM framework focuses on the client's sense of autonomy and the transition from an external locus of control (feeling controlled by others) to an internal one (taking responsibility for one's own life)."

            "question": "The Spann-Fischer Codependency Scale (SFCS) is a 16-item psychometric tool. Which of the following best describes its primary measurement goal?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnosing Borderline Personality Disorder",
                "Measuring codependency as a developmental personality trait",
                "Identifying the specific role a person plays in the Drama Triangle",
                "Evaluating the severity of chemical dependency in a partner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SFCS is designed to measure codependency as a personality trait defined by a pattern of relating to others, rather than just a reaction to a partner's addiction."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to the Holyoake Codependency Index (HCI), which subscale measures the tendency to be overly affected by the moods and behaviors of others?",
            "options": [

                "External Focus",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The HCI identifies three subscales: External Focus, Self-Sacrifice, and Reactivity. Reactivity specifically measures how easily a person's emotional state is disrupted by the actions or emotions of those around them."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "During the 'Examine' Audit (L3), a specialist uses Family Systems Mapping. If a client reveals they were often the 'mediator' between two fighting parents, what dynamic is being assessed?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation occurs when a third person (often a child) is pulled into a dyadic conflict to stabilize the relationship or deflect tension between the original two parties."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "When assessing the 'Core' (L4), a client scores low on 'Self-Referencing.' What does this clinically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client is narcissistic and lacks empathy",
                "The client has a strong, autonomous identity",

                "The client is unable to feel physical sensations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low self-referencing indicates that a client looks outward to others to determine what they should think, feel, or value, which is a hallmark of codependent identity erosion."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "In the 'Limits' Evaluation (L5), what is the 'Guilt-Threshold' metric used to determine?",

                "The amount of money a client spends on others",
                "The level of emotional distress felt when the client enforces a boundary",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Guilt-Threshold measures the intensity and duration of guilt a client experiences after setting a boundary. Recovery progress is marked by a decrease in this threshold."

                "'I am responsible for my own happiness.'",
                "'If my husband would just stop drinking, my life would be perfect.'",
                "'I need to set a limit on how much I help my sister today.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An external locus of control is characterized by the belief that external forces or other people determine one's emotional state and life outcomes."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In Interdependence Mapping (L7), the 'Reciprocity Ratio' is calculated to assess:",
            "options": [
                "The balance of emotional labor and support in a relationship",
                "The speed at which a client recovers from an argument",
                "The financial contributions of both partners",
                "The number of shared hobbies in the relationship"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Reciprocity Ratio evaluates whether the exchange of emotional support, chores, and caretaking is balanced or if one person is consistently over-functioning while the other under-functions."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Which 'Mastery Metric' (L8) is most effective for tracking 'Longitudinal Recovery' progress?",

                "The total number of therapy sessions attended",
                "The complete absence of all codependent thoughts",

                "The partner's willingness to enter treatment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovery Velocity is a key longitudinal metric; it measures how quickly a client can identify a codependent slip and return to healthy functioning, rather than staying 'stuck' for weeks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A specialist is working with 'Sarah,' who scores high on the HCI 'Self-Sacrifice' subscale but has a healthy 'Internal Locus of Control.' What is the most likely assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Sarah is in deep denial about her lack of agency",
                "Sarah is choosing to help others out of values-based altruism rather than compulsion",
                "Sarah is a 'Rescuer' who is unaware of her 'Victim' status",
                "Sarah's assessments are invalid and must be retaken"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High self-sacrifice paired with an internal locus of control often indicates 'Prosocial Autonomy'—where a person chooses to give from a place of strength and choice rather than a codependent need for validation."
