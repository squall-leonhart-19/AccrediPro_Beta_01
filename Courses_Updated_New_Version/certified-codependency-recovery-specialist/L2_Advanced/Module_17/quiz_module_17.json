            "options": [
                "The codependent projects their own anger onto the narcissist to feel safer.",
                "The narcissist induces their own disowned feelings (e.g., shame or inadequacy) into the codependent, who then feels and acts out those emotions.",
                "A healthy mirroring technique used in clinical settings to build empathy.",
                "The process of a codependent mimicking the narcissist's behaviors to gain favor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projective identification is an advanced defense mechanism where the narcissist 'deposits' unwanted feelings into the codependent, who then unconsciously accepts and processes those feelings as their own."

            "question": "When working with a client in a relationship with a partner who has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), the specialist must address 'Splitting.' How does this manifest in the codependent?",
            "options": [
                "The codependent begins to develop multiple personalities to cope.",
                "The codependent alternates between seeing the partner as 'all good' (idealization) and 'all bad' (devaluation) to match the partner's internal state.",
                "The codependent physically separates from the partner during every argument.",
                "The codependent refuses to acknowledge the partner's diagnosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Codependents often adopt the 'splitting' defense of their BPD partner, losing the ability to see the partner (and the relationship) in nuanced, 'middle-ground' terms."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In high-conflict divorce cases involving a narcissistic ex-spouse, why is 'Parallel Parenting' often recommended over 'Co-parenting'?",
            "options": [
                "Because it requires both parents to attend therapy together.",
                "Because it encourages frequent phone calls and joint decision-making.",
                "Because it minimizes direct contact and communication between parents, reducing the opportunity for conflict and manipulation.",
                "Because it is a legally required step before full custody can be granted."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel parenting allows high-conflict parents to parent their children independently in their own homes with minimal interaction, which is safer and more stable for children than high-conflict co-parenting."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Filial piety is a cultural script that can lead to multi-generational enmeshment, where setting boundaries with parents is viewed as a shameful betrayal rather than a healthy developmental step."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Financial infidelity involves secretive financial behaviors (hiding debt, secret accounts, or undisclosed spending) that break the trust and transparency of the partnership."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic integration involves 'bottom-up' processing—noticing how the body reacts (the Fawn response) in real-time to prevent the automatic 'Fixer' behavior."

                "The relief a caretaker feels when the patient is finally healthy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain can complicate recovery because the illness provides the patient with emotional needs (attention, control) that may inadvertently reinforce the caretaker's codependency."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A Recovery Specialist feels an intense urge to call a client's lawyer to 'fix' a legal misunderstanding in a high-conflict divorce case. This is an example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a specialist feels the urge to 'rescue' the client by stepping outside their professional role (like contacting lawyers), it is a sign of countertransference that mirrors the client's codependent dynamics."

            "question": "According to research on C-PTSD, the 'Fixer' archetype is often a manifestation of which trauma response?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Fawn' response involves appeasing others to avoid conflict or ensure safety, which is the foundational mechanism of the 'Fixer' archetype in codependency."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Gray Rock' method involves being boring, brief, and emotionally neutral so the high-conflict person loses interest in using the codependent for 'narcissistic supply' or conflict."
