            "question": "During the Clinical Assessment phase (L1), a Specialist uses the Codependency Assessment Tool (CAST). Which score range typically indicates 'Severe Codependent Tendencies' requiring intensive clinical intervention?",
            "options": [
                "10-20 points",
                "30-45 points",
                "Over 60 points",
                "CAST is a qualitative tool and does not provide numerical scores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In standardized codependency assessment protocols, a score exceeding 60 points on the CAST indicates severe patterns that generally require a structured, multi-phase treatment plan."

                "An increase in the client's 'Self-Efficacy Scale' score from 4 to 8"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Process metrics track the client's engagement with the treatment itself (like attendance), while outcome metrics measure the actual change in symptoms or behaviors resulting from the treatment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 focuses on safety and stabilization. Attempting to process deep trauma (Phase 2) without affect regulation skills (Phase 1) often leads to clinical retraumatization or dropout."

            "id": "q21_5",

            "options": [
                "Because codependents are usually too intellectual and need to think less",
                "To address the dysregulated autonomic nervous system before attempting high-level cognitive restructuring",
                "Because somatic work is faster than traditional talk therapy",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care recognizes that the 'reptilian brain' and nervous system must feel safe (bottom-up) before the prefrontal cortex can effectively process cognitive changes (top-down)."

                "The couple should seek individual therapy rather than systemic intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circular causality is a core tenet of Systems Theory, suggesting that in codependent dynamics, behaviors are reciprocal and self-perpetuating rather than simple linear cause-and-effect."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain occurs when a symptom (like caretaking) provides a hidden benefit, such as a sense of purpose, control, or the avoidance of one's own emotional pain, which can lead to resistance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective discharge planning requires identifying specific triggers (high-risk situations) and providing the client with pre-planned behavioral responses (action scripts) to maintain mastery."

                "Ignore the resistance and move directly to Discharge Planning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resistance is often a form of self-protection. Using Motivational Interviewing (MI) helps the client explore the ambivalence without the Specialist becoming an 'adversary' in the systemic loop."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery is not the absence of triggers, but the ability to recognize them and use internalized tools to maintain boundaries and self-regulation without constant professional guidance."
