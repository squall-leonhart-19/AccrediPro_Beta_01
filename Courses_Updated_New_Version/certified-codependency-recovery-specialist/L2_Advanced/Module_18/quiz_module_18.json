            "question": "What is the primary rationale for the 'non-linear' application of the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Method™ as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "The method is designed to be used randomly based on the coach's intuition.",
                "Recovery involves 'spiral' progress where deeper layers of trauma require revisiting earlier stages with new resources.",
                "It allows the specialist to skip the 'Examine' stage if the client is already self-aware.",
                "Non-linear application is only used for clients with high-functioning codependency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recovery is rarely a straight line; the non-linear approach recognizes that as clients gain strength, they can revisit earlier 'stages' to process deeper, previously inaccessible trauma layers."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "In advanced case formulation (Lesson 2), what is the 'Core Organizing Principle'?",

                "The fundamental unconscious belief or 'blueprint' that drives the client's systemic patterns.",
                "The 12-step program the client is currently attending."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Core Organizing Principle is the deep-seated unconscious belief (e.g., 'I only exist if I am needed') that dictates how the client organizes their entire relational world."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, when a client experiences a somatic 'freeze' response while trying to set a boundary, what is the recommended integrative sequence?",
            "options": [
                "Top-down cognitive reframing to explain why the boundary is logical.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis requires that the body feels safe enough to process the thought. Somatic stabilization (bottom-up) must precede complex cognitive work (top-down) during acute dysregulation."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Secondary Gain' is defined as:",

                "The financial benefit a specialist receives from a long-term client.",
                "The hidden psychological benefits or 'payoffs' that keep a client tethered to codependent behaviors.",
                "The progress a client's partner makes as a result of the client's recovery.",
                "A second chance at a relationship after a temporary separation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the unconscious benefits of staying 'sick' or codependent, such as avoiding the terrifying responsibility of autonomy or maintaining a sense of moral superiority."

                "Using the exact same approach as with individualistic clients to ensure 'standard of care'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intersectional integration requires adapting recovery to fit the client's cultural context, which often involves finding healthy ways to remain connected to a community while maintaining self-integrity."

                "The specialist uses a personal anecdote to build rapport with the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projective identification occurs when a client 'deposits' an unbearable feeling into the specialist, and the specialist begins to feel and act as if those feelings are their own."

                "The client has successfully convinced their partner to enter therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "True mastery is not the absence of triggers, but the physiological and psychological capacity to self-regulate and recover quickly when triggers occur."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The final quarter of a 12-month roadmap is dedicated to 'Synthesis,' ensuring the client has the tools and the new identity required to maintain recovery without the specialist's constant guidance."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Cognitive Dissonance'—they know their partner is abusive, but they feel an overwhelming somatic pull to 'rescue' them. This is an example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "This is a classic 'split' where the cognitive mind and the somatic/limbic system are not integrated, necessitating work that bridges the thought (truth) with the feeling (trauma bond)."
