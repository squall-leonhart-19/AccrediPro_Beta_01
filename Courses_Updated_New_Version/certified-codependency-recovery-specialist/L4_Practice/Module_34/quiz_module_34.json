            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'The Architecture of Recovery,' what is defined as the most critical element of the 'Group Container' to prevent re-traumatization for codependent clients?",
            "options": [
                "A highly rigid curriculum that prevents any off-topic discussion.",
                "Explicitly stated and co-created group agreements regarding confidentiality and 'cross-talk'.",
                "Ensuring the facilitator is the sole authority figure in the room at all times.",
                "A minimum of 20 participants to ensure anonymity within the group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Codependent recovery requires a 'safe container.' Explicit agreements, particularly regarding 'cross-talk' (giving unsolicited advice), are essential to prevent the caretaking behaviors that characterize codependency."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Facilitation Mastery, how should a facilitator handle a 'Monopolizer' who dominates the group's time without falling into a codependent 'fixing' trap?",
            "options": [
                "Interrupt them immediately and ask them to leave the session to protect the group.",
                "Wait for them to finish, then spend the rest of the session analyzing their behavior.",
                "Use a 'process observation' to gently point out the pattern and invite other voices into the space.",
                "Ignore the behavior to avoid hurting the participant's feelings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Process observation allows the facilitator to address the group dynamic in real-time without shaming the individual, maintaining the boundary while ensuring group equity."

            "question": "When developing a curriculum for a one-day workshop (Lesson 3), what is the recommended 'Arc of Transformation' sequence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard arc begins with an Opening (safety), moves to Education (cognitive understanding), then Experiential (emotional/body practice), and ends with Integration (grounding and future pacing)."

                "To help clients memorize the perfect script for saying 'no'.",
                "To force clients to confront their 'abusers' in a simulated environment.",
                "To increase the client's window of tolerance for the discomfort felt when setting a boundary.",
                "To prove that setting boundaries always results in positive external outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'L' phase focuses on the nervous system. The goal is to help clients stay regulated while feeling the 'guilt' or 'anxiety' that often accompanies boundary setting in codependency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sibling transference occurs between peers in a group, often recreating childhood dynamics of competing for parental (facilitator) validation or favor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interdependence is the middle ground between codependence and hyper-independence. The group acts as a safe space to practice being 'self' while in 'connection' with others."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To combat 'Zoom Fatigue' and maintain engagement in virtual settings, facilitators should change the stimulus (e.g., move from lecture to breakout, or screen share to gallery view) every 20 minutes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In codependency groups, 'helping' others is often a defense mechanism (resistance) used to deflect from the individual's own emotional discomfort or 'L' phase work."
