            "options": [
                "Specialists can prescribe medication, whereas therapists cannot.",
                "Specialists focus on future-oriented goals and behavioral patterns rather than diagnosing and treating clinical mental illness.",
                "There is no legal distinction; both roles are regulated by the same state boards.",
                "Specialists are legally allowed to treat active trauma without a referral."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Codependency Recovery Specialists operate within a coaching scope, focusing on growth, patterns, and future outcomes, whereas psychotherapists are licensed to diagnose and treat clinical mental health disorders."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the transformation and outcome for the client. Hourly billing ties income to time, meaning as a practitioner becomes more efficient, they technically earn less for the same result."
