            "question": "What is the primary psychological shift required when moving from a 'Solo Practitioner' mindset to a 'CEO' mindset in a recovery business?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on clinical outcomes while ignoring financial data",
                "Shifting from 'doing the work' to 'owning the systems' that deliver the work",
                "Increasing the number of 1:1 hours to maximize billable time",
                "Eliminating all administrative support to reduce overhead costs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition to CEO requires moving from a technician role (doing the work) to a visionary/managerial role (owning the systems), allowing the business to scale beyond the practitioner's personal time."

            "question": "In the RECLAIM Method™ for group coaching architecture, why is 'Leveraged Delivery' considered superior for codependency recovery compared to 1:1 sessions?",

                "It requires less preparation time from the coach",
                "It allows the coach to avoid difficult client confrontations",
                "It utilizes the 'group as the healer' to break the isolation and shame inherent in codependency",
                "It is always cheaper for the practitioner to operate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Codependency thrives in isolation; group coaching provides a 'social laboratory' where clients can practice boundaries and receive validation from peers, which accelerates the healing process."

            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "A practitioner develops a 'Value Ladder' starting with a $37 digital workbook. According to Digital Product Ecosystem theory, what is the primary purpose of this 'Low-Ticket' offer?",
            "options": [
                "To generate the majority of the business's net profit",
                "To replace the need for any high-ticket coaching",
                "To liquidate lead acquisition costs and build a list of 'buyers' rather than just 'subscribers'",
                "To provide a complete cure for codependency in one sitting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low-ticket offers (tripwires) are designed to convert leads into customers, establishing trust and offsetting marketing costs, while identifying those most likely to ascend to higher-level programs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Authority is established through a unique mechanism or 'Proprietary Framework' (like the RECLAIM Method™) that differentiates the practitioner from generalists and demonstrates a clear path to results."

            "options": [
                "To ensure the coach can receive illegal kickbacks for referrals",
                "To legally protect the coach when a client presents with clinical issues outside the coaching scope (e.g., active SI or severe PTSD)",
                "To allow the coach to diagnose mental health disorders",
                "To share client session notes without the client's consent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical scaling requires knowing the 'Scope of Practice.' Partnering with licensed clinicians ensures clients receive medical-grade care for clinical issues while the coach focuses on behavioral recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount in retreats. When a client is flooded, they cannot process information. Grounding techniques are required to stabilize the nervous system before any further work can be done."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pareto Principle (80/20) in scaling suggests that 80% of your results come from 20% of your activities. Sustainable scaling focuses on identifying and expanding that high-impact 20%."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high CLV:CAC ratio (ideally 3:1 or higher) indicates that the business makes significantly more from a client than it costs to find them, which is the green light for scaling."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Burnout in codependency specialists often manifests as compassion fatigue, relief when clients don't show up, and professional enmeshment where the coach's ego is tied to the client's 'success.'"
