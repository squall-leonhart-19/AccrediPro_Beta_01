            "question": "Which physiological adaptation during pregnancy primarily contributes to increased maternal blood volume and cardiac output?",
            "options": [
                "Relaxin production, leading to joint laxity",
                "Diastasis recti, caused by abdominal muscle separation",
                "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)",
                "Increased iron absorption in the small intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) during pregnancy leads to increased sodium and water retention, which significantly expands maternal blood volume and consequently increases cardiac output to meet the demands of the growing fetus and maternal tissues."

            "question": "A client in her second trimester reports experiencing persistent, severe headaches accompanied by blurred vision and sudden swelling in her hands and face. As a prenatal wellness coach, what is the most appropriate initial action?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest gentle massage techniques for headache relief and monitor hydration.",
                "Recommend incorporating magnesium-rich foods into her diet.",
                "Advise her to contact her healthcare provider immediately for medical evaluation.",
                "Reassure her that these symptoms are common discomforts of pregnancy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described (severe headaches, blurred vision, sudden swelling) are potential indicators of preeclampsia, a serious pregnancy complication. A prenatal coach's ethical responsibility and scope of practice mandate immediate referral to a healthcare provider for urgent medical assessment, as these symptoms fall outside the realm of wellness coaching."

            "question": "According to current evidence-based guidelines, what is the approximate additional daily caloric intake generally recommended for most pregnant individuals during their second trimester?",
            "options": [
                "No additional calories are typically needed.",
                "Approximately 150 kcal per day.",

                "Approximately 600 kcal per day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current recommendations from organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggest an additional intake of approximately 340 kcal/day during the second trimester and about 450 kcal/day during the third trimester for most pregnant individuals."

            "question": "When helping a client set a goal for increasing physical activity during pregnancy, which of the following best demonstrates a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goal?",
            "options": [
                "\"I want to exercise more often to feel better.\"",
                "\"I will try to walk a few times a week if I have time.\"",
                "\"I will walk for 30 minutes, 4 days a week, at a moderate intensity, for the next month, to improve my energy levels and reduce back pain.\"",
                "\"I plan to be very active throughout my entire pregnancy.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Option C is a SMART goal: it is Specific (walk 30 mins, 4 days/week, moderate intensity), Measurable (30 mins, 4 days), Achievable (realistic for many), Relevant (improving energy/reducing pain), and Time-bound (next month)."

            "question": "After the first trimester, prolonged exercise in a supine (lying on back) position is generally discouraged for pregnant individuals. What is the primary physiological reason for this recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "It significantly increases the risk of developing diastasis recti.",
                "It can lead to increased muscle cramping in the legs.",
                "It may compress the vena cava, reducing blood flow to the heart and uterus.",
                "It places excessive strain on the lumbar spine, worsening back pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "After the first trimester, the growing uterus can compress the inferior vena cava when a pregnant individual lies supine. This compression can reduce venous return to the heart, leading to a decrease in cardiac output, maternal hypotension (supine hypotensive syndrome), and reduced blood flow to the uterus and fetus."

            "question": "A client expresses, 'I'm really worried about my upcoming birth; I feel like I'm not prepared for what's to come.' Which coaching response best utilizes active listening and empathetic communication?",

                "\"Don't worry, everyone feels that way. You'll be fine.\"",
                "\"Have you taken any birthing classes? Those usually help.\"",

                "\"What specifically about the birth are you most worried about?\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Option C reflects the client's expressed feelings (anxious, overwhelmed) and the underlying concern (uncertainty of labor), demonstrating active listening and empathy by validating their emotional state. While Option D is a good follow-up, Option C immediately acknowledges and reflects the client's emotional experience."

            "question": "A client consistently reports feelings of profound sadness, anhedonia (loss of pleasure), and significant fatigue that interferes with daily functioning for several weeks. As a prenatal wellness coach, what is the most ethical and responsible course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest additional mindfulness exercises and stress reduction techniques.",
                "Recommend increasing their intake of Vitamin D and Omega-3 fatty acids.",

                "Reassure them that mood swings are a normal part of pregnancy and will likely pass."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent and severe symptoms of sadness, anhedonia, and fatigue can indicate perinatal depression or other mental health conditions. A prenatal coach's scope of practice does not include diagnosing or treating mental illness. The most responsible action is to encourage and facilitate a referral to a licensed mental health professional or their primary healthcare provider for appropriate assessment and care."

The coach's role in empowering client autonomy and informed decision-making should primarily involve:",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to reconsider if the plan deviates from typical medical advice.",
                "Providing additional evidence-based information related to their choices and supporting open dialogue with their healthcare provider.",
                "Expressing personal opinions or concerns about the feasibility of the chosen plan.",
                "Advising the client that the coach can only support medically approved birth plans."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowering client autonomy means respecting their choices while ensuring they have access to accurate, evidence-based information. The coach's role is to facilitate understanding, provide resources, and encourage the client to have comprehensive discussions with their medical team, rather than imposing personal views or limiting options within ethical boundaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'nesting instinct' is a well-recognized psychological phenomenon during pregnancy, characterized by a sudden burst of energy and an overwhelming desire to clean, organize, and prepare the home environment for the impending arrival of the baby."

                "Thoroughly washed fresh fruits and vegetables."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unpasteurized soft cheeses, deli meats, raw seafood, and unpasteurized juices are high-risk foods for Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that can cause Listeriosis, which is particularly dangerous during pregnancy due to potential severe complications for both mother and fetus."
