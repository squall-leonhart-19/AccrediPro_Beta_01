            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the client's feelings and using an open-ended question like 'What specifically about labor pain concerns you the most?' is a cornerstone of empathetic communication and active listening (L1, L2). It invites the client to elaborate, allowing the coach to understand her unique fears and beliefs, rather than making assumptions or dismissing her concerns."

                "Recommend she read articles comparing breastfeeding and formula feeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asking 'What does 'guilty' mean to you in this context, and what are your thoughts on both feeding methods?' directly probes the client's internal experience and values without judgment. This aligns with techniques for uncovering client beliefs and facilitating self-reflection, crucial for informed decision-making (L3, L8)."

            "explanation": "These symptoms (severe headache, blurred vision, sudden swelling) are potential indicators of preeclampsia, a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention. The coach's role is to recognize potential 'red flag' symptoms and advise prompt medical consultation, not to diagnose or treat (L4)."

            "question": "A client confides that she feels overwhelmed, cries frequently, has lost interest in activities she once enjoyed, and struggles with sleep, symptoms that have persisted for over three weeks. This aligns with potential indicators of a Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorder (PMAD) (L5). What is the coach's primary responsibility?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent and severe symptoms like these indicate a need for professional mental health evaluation.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the hierarchy of evidence, Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions, and systematic reviews or meta-analyses of RCTs provide the highest level of evidence. This is a core principle of evidence-based education (L6)."

            "explanation": "Tailoring education involves considering the client's learning style, health literacy, and practical constraints (L7).

            "explanation": "Empowering informed decision-making involves presenting balanced, evidence-based information, exploring the client's personal values, and using tools like a decisional balance exercise to help her weigh options.

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These non-verbal cues—direct eye contact, nodding, and leaning in—are classic indicators of active engagement, attentiveness, and rapport (L1). They signal that the client is processing the information and is present in the conversation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based recommendations for managing pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting often include consuming small, frequent bland meals and snacks, avoiding trigger foods (like spicy or fatty items), and separating liquids from solids. This helps maintain stable blood sugar and prevents an overly full stomach (L4)."
