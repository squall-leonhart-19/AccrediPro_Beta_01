            "question": "A client in her second trimester is keen on optimizing fetal brain development. As a coach, you highlight the importance of choline. What is the generally recommended daily intake (AI) for pregnant individuals, and what is a key role of choline in fetal development?",
            "options": [
                "300 mg/day; supports maternal energy and glucose regulation.",
                "450 mg/day; crucial for neurotransmitter synthesis and brain structure.",
                "600 mg/day; primarily for preventing gestational diabetes.",
                "900 mg/day; essential for maternal bone density."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Adequate Intake (AI) for choline during pregnancy is 450 mg/day. Choline is vital for fetal brain development, including neurotransmitter synthesis (acetylcholine) and the formation of cell membranes, particularly in the brain and spinal cord. It plays a significant role in cognitive function and memory."

            "question": "During a coaching session, a client mentions her physician recently diagnosed her with placenta previa. She asks about continuing her high-intensity interval training (HIIT) routine. What is the most appropriate coaching guidance?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage her to continue, but at a reduced intensity, as exercise is always beneficial.",
                "Advise her to switch to low-impact activities like swimming until the condition resolves.",
                "Inform her that placenta previa is a relative contraindication, requiring a physician's clearance for exercise.",
                "Explain that placenta previa is an absolute contraindication for most exercises, and she should cease HIIT immediately and consult her physician for any activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Placenta previa, a condition where the placenta covers the cervix, is an absolute contraindication for most types of exercise due to the significant risk of hemorrhage. A prenatal wellness coach must advise immediate cessation of high-impact activities and direct the client to consult her physician for specific guidance on any physical activity."

            "question": "A client reports increased anxiety as her due date approaches, leading to disrupted sleep. You introduce a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) technique. What is the primary mechanism through which MBSR helps manage prenatal anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "It suppresses cortisol production by directly stimulating the vagus nerve.",
                "It encourages active problem-solving and cognitive restructuring of fearful thoughts.",
                "It cultivates present-moment awareness, reducing rumination on future worries and enhancing emotional regulation.",
                "It provides a structured physical workout to release endorphins and reduce tension."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MBSR focuses on cultivating present-moment awareness and non-judgmental observation of thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. This practice helps reduce rumination on future anxieties, improves emotional regulation, and can significantly decrease perceived stress, as supported by studies showing a reduction in anxiety scores by 30-40% in pregnant populations engaging in regular mindfulness practices."

            "question": "A client in her third trimester reports sudden onset of significant swelling in her hands and face, along with a persistent, severe headache that doesn't improve with rest or over-the-counter pain relievers. While general edema is common, what specific combination of symptoms warrants immediate referral for medical evaluation?",
            "options": [
                "Mild leg swelling and occasional Braxton Hicks contractions.",
                "Heartburn and increased urinary frequency.",
                "Sudden onset of facial/hand swelling, severe headache, and visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision or spots).",
                "Sciatica pain and carpal tunnel syndrome."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While mild leg swelling and general discomforts are common, the sudden onset of significant facial and hand swelling, coupled with a severe, persistent headache and visual disturbances, are classic warning signs of preeclampsia, a serious pregnancy complication. A prenatal wellness coach must immediately advise the client to contact her healthcare provider."

            "question": "A client expresses concern that her birth preferences might not be respected by her healthcare team. As her coach, how do you best empower her for informed birth choices and advocacy?",
            "options": [
                "Advise her to simply trust her medical team, as they are the experts.",
                "Recommend she write a detailed, non-negotiable birth plan and present it firmly.",
                "Guide her on researching evidence-based options, understanding hospital policies, and practicing assertive, respectful communication with her provider.",
                "Suggest she choose a different care provider if she feels unheard."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowering informed birth choices involves educating the client on evidence-based practices, helping her understand her rights, and developing effective communication strategies. This includes researching options, understanding the facility's policies, and practicing assertive communication to ensure her preferences are heard and discussed respectfully, fostering a collaborative approach with her care team rather than an adversarial one."

            "question": "Following the birth of her baby, a client shares with you that she feels persistently sad, has difficulty bonding, and experiences significant sleep disturbances even when the baby sleeps. What is the recommended timeframe for universal screening for postpartum depression (PPD) and anxiety, and what tool is commonly used?",
            "options": [
                "At 6 weeks postpartum; using the Apgar score.",
                "At every prenatal visit; using a general mood questionnaire.",
                "At 2-6 weeks postpartum and again at 3-6 months; using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).",
                "Only if symptoms are severe; using a clinical interview by a psychiatrist."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends universal screening for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders at least once during the perinatal period, and typically at the 2-6 week postpartum visit and again at 3-6 months. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a widely validated and commonly used screening tool for PPD and anxiety."

            "question": "A client and her partner are struggling with increased tension and misunderstandings since the third trimester. They express feeling overwhelmed and disconnected. Which communication strategy would a prenatal wellness coach most effectively recommend to foster better partnership dynamics?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage separate 'venting sessions' with friends to avoid conflict at home.",
                "Advise them to establish a strict division of labor, assigning all tasks to avoid overlap.",
                "Introduce the 'I Feel' statements technique and scheduled 'check-in' discussions to express needs and feelings without blame.",
                "Suggest they minimize discussion of pregnancy-related stress to maintain a positive atmosphere."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'I Feel' statements technique (e.g., 'I feel [emotion] when [situation] because [reason], and I need/would appreciate [solution]') promotes non-blaming communication. Scheduled 'check-in' discussions create a dedicated space for partners to express their needs, feelings, and concerns, fostering empathy and understanding, which is crucial for strengthening partnership dynamics during this transformative period."

            "question": "During a virtual coaching session, a client in her 34th week of pregnancy reports experiencing regular, painful contractions every 5-7 minutes for the past hour, accompanied by a gush of fluid. She asks if this is just 'false labor.' What is the immediate and ethical response of a prenatal wellness coach?",
            "options": [
                "Reassure her that it's likely Braxton Hicks and suggest she try a warm bath.",
                "Advise her to perform a self-assessment for cervical dilation and report back.",
                "Explain that these symptoms could indicate preterm labor or rupture of membranes and instruct her to contact her healthcare provider immediately.",
                "Offer breathing exercises to manage the pain until her next scheduled appointment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A prenatal wellness coach's scope of practice does not include diagnosing medical conditions. Symptoms like regular, painful contractions before 37 weeks and a gush of fluid are potential signs of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes, both of which require immediate medical evaluation. The ethical and responsible action is to instruct the client to contact her healthcare provider immediately."

            "question": "A client who is an avid runner and plans to continue modified training throughout her pregnancy asks about specific nutritional adjustments. Beyond standard prenatal recommendations, what additional emphasis should a coach place for an active pregnant individual?",
            "options": [
                "Significantly reduce carbohydrate intake to prevent excessive weight gain.",
                "Increase protein intake to 1.1-1.5 g/kg body weight, ensure adequate hydration (e.g., 10-12 glasses of water daily), and focus on electrolyte balance.",
                "Focus solely on caloric restriction to manage energy expenditure.",
                "Prioritize high-fat diets for sustained energy during long runs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active pregnant individuals have increased energy and nutrient demands. Protein intake should be slightly higher than for sedentary pregnant individuals (around 1.1-1.5 g/kg body weight) to support maternal and fetal tissue growth and muscle repair. Crucially, maintaining optimal hydration (10-12 glasses of water daily) and electrolyte balance is essential to prevent dehydration and muscle cramps, especially during and after exercise."

            "question": "A client in her first trimester is struggling with severe morning sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum) and heightened anxiety due to constant nausea and fatigue, impacting her daily life and mood. How should a prenatal wellness coach best approach this complex situation?",
            "options": [
                "Focus solely on dietary changes to manage nausea, as it's the primary physical discomfort.",
                "Advise her to push through the discomfort, reminding her that it's a normal part of pregnancy.",
                "Implement a holistic approach addressing both physical comfort (e.g., small, frequent meals, ginger, acupressure) and emotional regulation (e.g., gentle mindfulness, sleep hygiene), while also facilitating a referral to her healthcare provider for medical management of HG and a therapist for severe anxiety.",
                "Refer her immediately to a psychiatrist for medication, as the condition is clearly beyond coaching scope."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This situation requires a multi-faceted and holistic coaching approach, combined with appropriate medical referrals. While coaches can offer strategies for physical comfort (dietary adjustments, ginger, acupressure) and emotional regulation (mindfulness, sleep hygiene), severe hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and heightened, debilitating anxiety require medical intervention. A coach's role is to support the client through these strategies while ensuring they receive necessary medical care from their OBGYN for HG management and potentially a therapist or psychiatrist for severe anxiety, acting as a bridge to comprehensive support."
