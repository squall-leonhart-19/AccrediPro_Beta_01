            "question": "A Certified Prenatal Wellness Coach™ utilizing the AccrediPro methodology is primarily responsible for empowering clients through education and support. Which of the following activities falls *outside* the scope of practice for a prenatal wellness coach?",
            "options": [
                "Providing personalized meal plans for managing gestational diabetes.",
                "Guiding clients in setting SMART goals for increasing physical activity.",
                "Educating clients on evidence-based nutritional guidelines for pregnancy.",
                "Facilitating stress reduction techniques like mindfulness and deep breathing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Providing personalized meal plans for managing specific medical conditions like gestational diabetes falls under the scope of a Registered Dietitian or medical professional, not a prenatal wellness coach. Coaches educate and support, but do not diagnose or prescribe medical treatments."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "During the first trimester of pregnancy, significant physiological changes occur to support fetal development. Which hormone is primarily responsible for maintaining the corpus luteum and preventing menstruation, often leading to early pregnancy symptoms like nausea?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen",
                "Progesterone",
                "Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)",
                "Oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is the hormone produced by the developing placenta. It signals the corpus luteum to continue producing progesterone and estrogen, preventing the shedding of the uterine lining and maintaining the pregnancy. High levels of hCG are also associated with morning sickness."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client in their first trimester expresses concern about neural tube defects. As a prenatal wellness coach, you would emphasize the critical importance of which nutrient, recommending supplementation if dietary intake is insufficient?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D",
                "Iron",
                "Folate (Folic Acid)",
                "Calcium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Folate (or its synthetic form, folic acid) is crucial for the proper development of the fetal neural tube, which forms the brain and spinal cord. Adequate intake before and during early pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of neural tube defects."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "According to general guidelines for exercise during pregnancy, which of the following activities should typically be avoided or significantly modified, especially in later trimesters, due to potential risks?",
            "options": [
                "Moderate-intensity walking",
                "Swimming",
                "Contact sports or activities with a high risk of abdominal trauma",
                "Prenatal yoga"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Activities that involve a high risk of falling, abdominal trauma, or impact (such as contact sports, downhill skiing, or horseback riding) are generally contraindicated during pregnancy due to the potential for serious injury to both mother and fetus. Moderate walking, swimming, and prenatal yoga are generally safe and recommended."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Many clients experience a range of emotional fluctuations during early pregnancy. One common challenge reported, often exacerbated by hormonal shifts and fatigue, is increased anxiety or mood swings. What is a key coaching strategy to support emotional well-being in this context?",

                "Advise immediate psychiatric medication.",
                "Encourage self-isolation to manage feelings.",

                "Dismiss their feelings as 'normal' pregnancy hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A prenatal wellness coach's role is to empower clients with coping strategies, help them identify and build support systems, and educate them on stress reduction. It is also crucial to recognize when a client's emotional challenges warrant a referral to a qualified mental health professional, as coaching does not replace therapy or medical intervention."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "A client expresses concern about environmental factors impacting their pregnancy. Which lifestyle factor, beyond direct nutrition and exercise, has a well-documented association with adverse prenatal outcomes and should be a focus of discussion for creating a supportive environment?",

                "Daily screen time exceeding 2 hours.",
                "Exposure to secondhand smoke.",
                "Occasional consumption of processed foods.",
                "Infrequent use of organic cleaning products."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exposure to secondhand smoke is a significant environmental risk factor strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm birth, and increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). While other factors can influence health, secondhand smoke has a direct and well-established detrimental impact."

            "question": "When applying the BLOOM framework's 'Build Foundations' phase, a prenatal wellness coach's primary objective is to:",
            "options": [
                "Immediately prescribe a detailed fitness regimen.",
                "Conduct a comprehensive intake to understand the client's current health status, lifestyle, and unique needs, while establishing rapport.",
                "Focus solely on identifying past failures in health goals.",
                "Refer the client to a specialist without any initial assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Build Foundations' phase of the BLOOM framework emphasizes thorough client assessment. This involves gathering comprehensive information about their health history, current lifestyle, goals, challenges, and support systems. This initial intake is vital for establishing rapport and building a personalized coaching plan."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A client, whom you have been coaching for several weeks, asks if you would also babysit their older child occasionally. This situation presents a potential ethical dilemma related to:",

                "Dual relationships.",
                "Scope of practice violations.",
                "Informed consent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This scenario represents a classic example of a 'dual relationship,' where a professional and personal relationship exist simultaneously. Dual relationships can compromise objectivity, create conflicts of interest, and blur professional boundaries, which is generally discouraged in ethical coaching practice."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client mentions enjoying soft cheeses and deli meats, but also asks about food safety during pregnancy. As a coach, you would advise them that consumption of these items carries a risk of which foodborne illness, which can be particularly dangerous during pregnancy?",

                "Norovirus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Soft cheeses (like feta, brie, camembert, blue-veined cheeses) and deli meats (unless reheated to steaming hot) are known sources of Listeria monocytogenes. Listeriosis can cause severe illness in pregnant individuals, potentially leading to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm labor, or serious infection in the newborn."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "During a coaching session, a client discloses experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed, and difficulty sleeping for the past three weeks.

                "Encourage them to 'tough it out' as pregnancy can be hard.",
                "Express empathy, acknowledge their feelings, and strongly recommend referral to a qualified mental health professional for assessment and support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described suggest potential prenatal depression or another significant mental health concern. While coaches offer support, diagnosing and treating mental health conditions is outside their scope. The ethical and most responsible action is to express empathy and facilitate a referral to a qualified mental health professional for proper assessment and care."
