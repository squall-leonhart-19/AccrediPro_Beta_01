            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach is working with a client who reports severe, persistent abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. What is the most appropriate action for the coach, adhering to professional scope and ethics?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the client on potential home remedies for pain relief.",
                "Recommend specific over-the-counter medications to manage symptoms.",
                "Urgently advise the client to seek immediate medical attention from their healthcare provider.",
                "Provide reassurance that these symptoms are common in pregnancy and will likely pass."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding are red flag symptoms that fall outside the scope of prenatal wellness coaching. The coach's ethical responsibility is to urgently refer the client to a qualified healthcare provider for immediate medical evaluation, as per the 'Role, Scope, and Ethics' lesson (L1)."

            "question": "Which physiological adaptation is primarily responsible for the increased blood volume observed during pregnancy, typically peaking in the third trimester?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of red blood cells.",
                "A disproportionate increase in plasma volume compared to red blood cell mass.",
                "Decreased renal blood flow leading to fluid retention.",
                "Enhanced lymphatic system activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During pregnancy, plasma volume increases by approximately 40-50%, while red blood cell mass increases by 20-30%. This disproportionate increase leads to a significant rise in total blood volume, contributing to 'physiologic anemia of pregnancy' (L2: Physiological & Psychological Adaptations)."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A pregnant client expresses concern about meeting her iron needs. Which of the following is the most critical recommendation for a prenatal wellness coach to reinforce regarding iron intake during pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "Iron supplementation should only be considered if the client experiences severe fatigue.",
                "Pairing iron-rich foods with Vitamin C sources enhances absorption.",
                "Dairy products should be consumed alongside iron-rich meals to maximize absorption.",
                "Daily iron requirements remain constant throughout all trimesters."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C significantly enhances the absorption of non-heme iron (iron from plant sources), which is a crucial strategy for preventing iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. Iron requirements increase substantially, especially in the second and third trimesters, and should be discussed with a healthcare provider (L3: Nutritional Foundations)."

                "Moderate fatigue after a long walk."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent vaginal bleeding or amniotic fluid leakage are serious warning signs and absolute contraindications to exercise during pregnancy, as per guidelines from organizations like ACOG. These symptoms require immediate medical evaluation (L4: Safe and Effective Movement)."

                "Suggest she try relaxation techniques to improve sleep.",
                "Reassure her that mood swings are normal in pregnancy.",
                "Validate her feelings and recommend she discuss these symptoms with her healthcare provider for a mental health assessment.",
                "Advise her to increase her physical activity to boost her mood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These symptoms (persistent sadness, anhedonia, sleep disturbance) are indicative of potential antenatal depression. While a coach can offer support, diagnosing and treating mental health conditions is outside their scope. The most appropriate action is to validate her experience and strongly recommend a professional mental health assessment by a qualified healthcare provider (L5: Emotional Well-being and Mental Health)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Paraphrasing the client's words and reflecting their underlying emotions demonstrates empathy, ensures understanding, and makes the client feel heard and valued. This is a core component of active listening and building rapport, central to the 'Listen & Learn' principle (L6: Building Rapport and Effective Communication)."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Build Foundations' approach for initial client assessment (L7), what is the primary purpose of exploring a client's 'Why' (their motivations, values, and vision) early in the coaching relationship?",
            "options": [
                "To identify potential areas where the client might resist coaching.",

                "To uncover deep-seated personal drivers that will sustain motivation and guide goal setting.",
                "To determine if the client is suitable for the coaching program."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Build Foundations' approach emphasizes understanding a client's intrinsic motivations and values. Exploring their 'Why' helps to uncover profound personal drivers that are essential for long-term adherence, resilience, and meaningful goal setting, fostering a client-centered journey (L7: Comprehensive Initial Client Assessment)."

            "question": "A client's partner contacts the prenatal wellness coach, asking for details about the client's progress and challenges discussed during sessions. What is the ethical response from the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Share general progress updates without specific details.",
                "Inform the partner that all client information is confidential and cannot be shared without the client's explicit, informed consent.",
                "Ask the client if it's okay to share information with their partner.",
                "Share information only if the partner promises to keep it confidential."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Client confidentiality is a cornerstone of ethical coaching practice. Information cannot be shared with any third party, including spouses or partners, without the client's explicit, informed, and documented consent. This upholds professional boundaries and client trust (L8: Ethical Practice and Professional Boundaries)."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A prenatal client asks her coach for advice on specific financial planning strategies for maternity leave, as the coach mentioned having a background in finance before becoming a wellness coach. What should the coach do?",

                "Provide some general financial tips, as it's a helpful gesture.",
                "Offer to connect the client with a financial advisor from their previous professional network.",
                "Politely decline, explaining that financial advice falls outside the scope of prenatal wellness coaching and refer them to a qualified financial professional.",
                "Offer to review their financial plan as a one-time favor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario highlights the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and operating strictly within the defined scope of prenatal wellness coaching. Even with a relevant past background, providing financial advice creates a dual relationship and exceeds the coach's current professional role. The correct action is to decline and refer to a qualified expert (L1, L8: Role, Scope, and Ethics; Ethical Practice and Professional Boundaries)."

                "Advise against any exercise due to fatigue and recommend comfort foods to alleviate anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This option demonstrates a holistic and integrated coaching approach, addressing multiple interconnected aspects of wellness. It covers sleep (hygiene), nutrition (blood sugar stabilization), safe movement (gentle yoga), and emotional well-being (validation, communication with HCP for anxiety), aligning with comprehensive prenatal wellness coaching principles from lessons L3, L4, and L5."
