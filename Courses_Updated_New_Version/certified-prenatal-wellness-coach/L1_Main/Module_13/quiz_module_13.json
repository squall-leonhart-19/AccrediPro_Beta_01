            "question": "A pregnant client in her third trimester reports increased shortness of breath with mild exertion, a common experience in late pregnancy. Which advanced physiological adaptation is the primary contributor to this symptom?",
            "options": [
                "Decreased cardiac output due to uterine compression.",
                "Increased tidal volume and minute ventilation, leading to a sensation of dyspnea.",
                "Increased blood viscosity and peripheral vascular resistance.",
                "A significant drop in maternal hemoglobin levels below physiological anemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While cardiac output significantly increases (L1), the sensation of dyspnea or shortness of breath in pregnancy is primarily attributed to the respiratory system's adaptations, specifically an increase in tidal volume and minute ventilation (L1). The body increases its respiratory drive to meet the higher oxygen demand, which can lead to a feeling of being 'air hungry' even at rest or with mild exertion, despite normal oxygen saturation. This is a common and normal physiological change."

            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach suspects a client may be experiencing symptoms of perinatal anxiety, including excessive worry, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating. Which validated screening tool is most appropriate for assessing generalized anxiety in the perinatal period?",
            "options": [
                "Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)",
                "Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)",
                "Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)",
                "Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) (L2) is a validated and widely used screening tool specifically designed to assess symptoms of generalized anxiety. The EPDS and PHQ-9 are primarily for depression, and the BDI is also a depression assessment tool. A wellness coach should use appropriate tools for suspected conditions before making referrals."

            "question": "For a client diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), which nutritional strategy is paramount for effective glycemic control and minimizing adverse outcomes for both mother and baby?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating all carbohydrate sources from the diet to prevent blood sugar spikes.",
                "Focusing on consistent carbohydrate distribution throughout the day, emphasizing complex, high-fiber carbohydrates.",
                "Prioritizing saturated fats to provide alternative energy sources and promote satiety.",
                "Significantly increasing fruit juice intake for quick energy and hydration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The cornerstone of nutritional management for GDM (L3) is consistent carbohydrate distribution throughout the day, focusing on complex, high-fiber carbohydrates. This approach helps to stabilize blood glucose levels, prevent spikes, and meet nutritional needs. Eliminating all carbohydrates is neither healthy nor sustainable, saturated fats are not a priority, and fruit juice is high in simple sugars that can exacerbate hyperglycemia."

            "question": "A client with a new diagnosis of mild preeclampsia (without severe features) asks her prenatal wellness coach about continuing her regular moderate-intensity exercise routine. What is the most appropriate advice regarding exercise modification, assuming medical clearance?",
            "options": [
                "Discontinue all exercise immediately to prevent any potential blood pressure spikes.",
                "Continue her routine as normal, but monitor for symptoms like headache or visual disturbances.",
                "Modify to low-impact, moderate-intensity exercise, avoiding Valsalva maneuvers and supine positions, while closely monitoring for warning signs, under ongoing medical guidance.",
                "Focus solely on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve cardiovascular health and manage blood pressure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For mild preeclampsia (L4), complete cessation of exercise is often not necessary if medically cleared. However, modifications are crucial. Low-impact, moderate-intensity exercise is generally safe, but avoiding Valsalva maneuvers (which can increase blood pressure) and prolonged supine positions (which can compress the vena cava) is important. Close monitoring for warning signs is paramount. High-intensity exercise or continuing without modification is not recommended."

            "question": "A client expresses concern that her birth preferences, including her desire for intermittent fetal monitoring and delayed cord clamping, are not being fully respected by her care team. As a prenatal wellness coach, what is the most empowering advocacy strategy you can help her develop?",
            "options": [
                "Advise her to simply follow all medical recommendations without question to avoid conflict or stress.",
                "Encourage her to write a detailed letter of complaint to the hospital administration after the birth.",
                "Help her formulate clear, concise questions for her providers, understand the evidence-based rationale for her choices, and practice assertive communication to articulate her preferences.",
                "Suggest she change care providers immediately, regardless of her stage of pregnancy or the availability of alternatives."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowering informed birth choices (L5) involves equipping the client with the tools to advocate for herself. This includes understanding the evidence (e.g., for intermittent monitoring or delayed cord clamping), formulating clear questions, and practicing assertive communication. Simply complying, complaining post-facto, or making a rash change in providers does not empower the client in the moment."

            "question": "A client asks her prenatal wellness coach for a specific, individualized meal plan to manage her newly diagnosed Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). What is the most appropriate response from the coach, adhering strictly to professional scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a detailed meal plan based on general GDM guidelines and online resources.",
                "Recommend a specific low-carbohydrate diet and suggest a list of supplements known to help with blood sugar control.",
                "Explain that providing specific dietary prescriptions falls outside the coach's scope of practice and refer her to a Registered Dietitian or a medical nutritionist specializing in prenatal care.",
                "Advise her to look up GDM diets online and choose one that seems best suited for her preferences."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing specific, individualized meal plans or prescribing supplements for medical conditions like GDM (L6) falls outside the scope of practice for a prenatal wellness coach. The most appropriate action is to recognize the boundaries of one's expertise and refer the client to a qualified healthcare professional, such as a Registered Dietitian or medical nutritionist, who is trained and licensed to provide such specialized guidance."

            "question": "During active labor, a client is experiencing intense back pain, often referred to as 'back labor.' Which non-pharmacological comfort measure is often highly effective for alleviating this type of pain by applying pressure to the sacrum?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatherapy with lavender oil diffused in the room.",
                "Hydrotherapy in a warm bath or shower.",
                "Counterpressure applied firmly to the lower back or sacrum.",
                "Focusing solely on slow, deep abdominal breathing techniques."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Counterpressure (L7) is a highly effective non-pharmacological comfort measure specifically for 'back labor.' Applying firm, sustained pressure to the sacrum helps to alleviate the intense pressure and pain caused by the baby's head pressing against the mother's sacrum during contractions. While aromatherapy, hydrotherapy, and breathing techniques can provide general comfort, counterpressure directly targets the mechanism of back labor."

            "question": "A client in the first week postpartum expresses tearfulness, irritability, and mood swings, but also experiences moments of joy and connection with her baby. Her partner is concerned. What is the most likely initial assessment, and what advice should the wellness coach offer?",
            "options": [
                "This immediately indicates Postpartum Depression; an urgent psychiatric referral is needed.",
                "These symptoms are typical of the 'baby blues' and usually resolve within two weeks; encourage rest, partner support, self-care, and continued monitoring for worsening symptoms.",
                "This is a clear sign of severe postpartum anxiety; recommend strong sedatives to help her cope.",
                "These are normal signs of bonding with the baby and require no specific intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The described symptoms of tearfulness, irritability, and mood swings, coupled with moments of joy, are classic presentations of the 'baby blues' (L8). This condition affects 50-80% of new mothers and typically resolves within the first two weeks postpartum. The coach should offer reassurance, emphasize the importance of rest and support, and advise monitoring for symptom persistence or worsening, which would then warrant further evaluation for PMADs."

            "question": "A postpartum client, 4 weeks into breastfeeding, reports persistent fatigue, weakness, and a general lack of energy, despite adequate sleep. She followed a vegetarian diet pre-pregnancy. The wellness coach, recognizing potential nutritional deficiencies common in this population, suspects a key nutrient. Which nutrient is most commonly deficient in this scenario and critical for energy production, especially in vegetarian breastfeeding mothers?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Iron",
                "Calcium",
                "Omega-3 fatty acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Persistent fatigue and weakness are classic symptoms of iron deficiency anemia (L3, L8). Postpartum women are at increased risk due to blood loss during birth and the demands of lactation. Vegetarian diets, which often lack highly bioavailable heme iron, further increase this risk. Iron is crucial for hemoglobin production and oxygen transport, directly impacting energy levels. While other nutrients are important, iron deficiency is a primary concern in this specific scenario."

            "question": "A client in her second trimester, who regularly practices yoga, asks about modifications for her practice as her pregnancy progresses. She also mentions occasional round ligament pain. Which yoga modification would be most beneficial for managing round ligament pain while maintaining core stability?",
            "options": [
                "Deep twisting poses that compress the abdomen to stretch side body muscles.",
                "Intense inversions like headstands or handstands to alleviate uterine pressure.",
                "Incorporating gentle pelvic tilts and cat-cow poses to mobilize the pelvis and strengthen deep core muscles.",
                "Prolonged static planks to strengthen the rectus abdominis and prevent diastasis recti."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle pelvic tilts and cat-cow poses (L4, L7) are highly beneficial during pregnancy. They help to gently mobilize the pelvis, improve spinal flexibility, and engage the deep core muscles (transverse abdominis), which can provide support and alleviate round ligament pain by improving pelvic alignment and reducing tension. Deep twists and intense inversions are generally contraindicated or require significant modification. Prolonged static planks can put undue pressure on the linea alba and are not ideal for preventing diastasis recti in later pregnancy."
