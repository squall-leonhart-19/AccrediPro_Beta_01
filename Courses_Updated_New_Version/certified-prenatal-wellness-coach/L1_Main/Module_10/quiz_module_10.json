            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which aspect of the BLOOM Framework™ primarily focuses on establishing a comprehensive understanding of a client's current physical and mental state, including their daily routines, habits, and baseline health markers?",
            "options": ["Balance", "Lifestyle", "Optimism", "Mindset"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'B' in BLOOM stands for Balance or Baseline, which involves thoroughly assessing the client's current health status, lifestyle, and foundational well-being to identify their starting point."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "During pregnancy, the maternal cardiovascular system undergoes significant adaptations. Which of the following is a key physiological change observed, leading to increased oxygen delivery to the uteroplacental unit and maternal tissues?",
            "options": ["Decreased cardiac output", "Decreased blood volume", "Increased heart rate and cardiac output", "Increased systemic vascular resistance"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pregnancy leads to a substantial increase in maternal blood volume (by 30-50%), heart rate, and stroke volume, collectively resulting in a 30-50% increase in cardiac output by the second trimester to meet the metabolic demands of the growing fetus and maternal tissues."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach is advising a client on essential nutrients for fetal development. Which nutrient is crucial for preventing neural tube defects and should be supplemented, ideally starting preconception, at a daily dose of 400-800 mcg?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Calcium", "Folate", "Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Folate (or folic acid) is critically important for neural tube development, and supplementation is recommended to begin at least one month prior to conception and continue through the first trimester to significantly reduce the risk of neural tube defects."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "A client in her third trimester reports increasing lower back pain and notes a noticeable 'waddling' gait. This is most likely attributed to the increased production of which hormone, leading to greater ligamentous laxity in the pelvic girdle?",
            "options": ["Progesterone", "Estrogen", "Relaxin", "Oxytocin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Relaxin is a hormone that causes the ligaments in the pelvis to soften and relax, preparing the body for childbirth. While beneficial for delivery, this increased laxity can contribute to pelvic instability, lower back pain, and changes in gait during pregnancy."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client in her second trimester complains of frequent heartburn. As a prenatal wellness coach, what initial dietary and lifestyle recommendation would be most appropriate to help alleviate this common discomfort?",
            "options": ["Suggest taking over-the-counter antacids immediately", "Advise eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding spicy/acidic foods", "Recommend lying down immediately after eating to aid digestion", "Instruct her to eliminate all dairy products from her diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heartburn in pregnancy is often due to hormonal changes relaxing the esophageal sphincter and the growing uterus pressing on the stomach. Eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding trigger foods (spicy, acidic, fatty), and remaining upright after eating are effective first-line strategies."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "According to ACOG guidelines, which of the following is considered an absolute contraindication to exercise during pregnancy, requiring immediate medical consultation and avoidance of exercise?",
            "options": ["Mild gestational hypertension", "History of premature labor in a previous pregnancy", "Placenta previa after 26 weeks' gestation", "Moderate anemia"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Placenta previa after 26 weeks' gestation is an absolute contraindication to exercise due to the significant risk of hemorrhage. The other options are typically relative contraindications or conditions that require medical clearance and modifications, but not absolute cessation of exercise."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "During an initial assessment, a client expresses persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed, and significant difficulty sleeping for the past three weeks. As a prenatal wellness coach, the most appropriate next step is to:",
            "options": ["Reassure her that mood swings are normal in pregnancy", "Suggest she try mindfulness meditation and relaxation techniques", "Recommend she consult with her healthcare provider for a mental health screening", "Advise her to increase her social activities and seek more support from family"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These symptoms are indicative of potential perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs). While wellness coaches can offer support, it is crucial to refer clients with persistent concerning symptoms to their healthcare provider for a professional mental health screening and diagnosis."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "When applying the 'B' (Balance/Baseline) in the BLOOM Framework™ during the initial client assessment, which of the following is the primary objective?",
            "options": ["To immediately create a detailed birth plan for the client", "To identify and diagnose all medical conditions requiring specialist intervention", "To establish a comprehensive understanding of the client's current health status, lifestyle, goals, and potential challenges", "To prescribe nutritional supplements and exercise routines"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Balance/Baseline' phase of the BLOOM Framework™ is dedicated to gathering thorough information about the client's current physical, mental, and emotional state, their lifestyle, and their aspirations, forming the foundation for personalized coaching."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A significant physiological adaptation during pregnancy is the increase in maternal blood volume. By term, blood volume can increase by approximately 30-50%, with plasma volume increasing more than red blood cell mass. This change primarily serves to:",
            "options": ["Decrease cardiac output and reduce the workload on the heart", "Compensate for anticipated blood loss during delivery and meet the demands of the uteroplacental unit", "Increase blood pressure to ensure adequate fetal perfusion", "Reduce the risk of iron-deficiency anemia due to hemodilution"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The substantial increase in blood volume is a protective mechanism, preparing the mother's body for the physiological blood loss that occurs during childbirth. It also supports the increased metabolic demands of the growing fetus and placenta."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client asks about food safety during pregnancy. Which food item should a prenatal client be specifically advised to avoid due to the risk of Listeria infection?",
            "options": ["Well-cooked poultry", "Pasteurized milk", "Soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk", "Fully cooked fish"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk (such as feta, brie, camembert, blue-veined cheeses) carry a higher risk of Listeria monocytogenes contamination, which can cause serious illness in pregnant individuals and harm the fetus. Pasteurized dairy products and properly cooked foods are generally safe."
