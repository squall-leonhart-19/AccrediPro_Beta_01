            "question": "A client asks their Prenatal Wellness Coach for a specific diagnosis for their persistent fatigue and nausea. According to the AccrediPro Academy's ethical guidelines and the coach's scope of practice, what is the most appropriate response?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a potential diagnosis based on common early pregnancy symptoms.",
                "Recommend specific over-the-counter medications to alleviate symptoms.",
                "Advise the client to consult with their healthcare provider for diagnosis and medical management.",
                "Suggest a detailed dietary plan to naturally resolve the symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prenatal Wellness Coaches operate within a non-medical scope. Providing a diagnosis or recommending medical treatment falls outside this scope and could be harmful. The ethical responsibility is to refer to a qualified healthcare professional."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "During an initial consultation, a client mentions they feel overwhelmed by the conflicting advice they've received about prenatal nutrition. Applying principles from the 'Building Foundations' (B) phase of the BLOOM Framework, what is the coach's best approach to address this?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately provide a detailed, evidence-based nutritional plan to clarify confusion.",
                "Validate their feelings, actively listen to their specific concerns, and ask open-ended questions about their current understanding and sources of information.",
                "Discount the conflicting advice and emphasize that only the coach's advice should be followed.",
                "Suggest they stop researching online and only get information from their doctor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Building Foundations' phase emphasizes active listening and empathy to understand the client's current situation, concerns, and knowledge base before providing guidance. Validating feelings builds rapport and trust."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A common physiological adaptation in early pregnancy is a significant increase in maternal blood volume. According to Lesson 3, by what approximate percentage can total maternal blood volume increase by the end of pregnancy, contributing to changes like increased cardiac output?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "20-25%",
                "40-50%",
                "60-70%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maternal blood volume typically increases by 40-50% by term, with a substantial portion of this occurring in the first and second trimesters, leading to increased cardiac output and often lower peripheral resistance."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A client in her first trimester is concerned about food safety, particularly regarding listeria. Which food item should the coach advise her to avoid or consume only if thoroughly cooked, based on food safety guidelines for pregnant individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Fresh, raw spinach (thoroughly washed)",
                "Hard cheeses like aged cheddar",
                "Unpasteurized soft cheeses like Brie or Feta",
                "Fully cooked chicken breast"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unpasteurized soft cheeses are a known risk factor for listeria contamination, which can be particularly dangerous during pregnancy. Hard cheeses, thoroughly washed raw vegetables, and properly cooked meats are generally safe."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A previously sedentary pregnant client wants to start exercising in her first trimester. Based on AccrediPro guidelines for safe movement, what is the recommended intensity level for most healthy pregnant individuals during moderate-intensity exercise?",
            "options": [
                "Max heart rate (MHR) of 85-90%",
                "Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 15-18 (hard to very hard)",
                "A level where she can comfortably carry on a conversation (Talk Test)",
                "Sustained high-impact activities like jumping or sprinting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For most healthy pregnant individuals, moderate-intensity exercise is recommended, which corresponds to a level where one can still talk comfortably (the 'Talk Test'). An RPE of 13-14 (somewhat hard) is also often cited for moderate intensity."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "During a coaching session, a client expresses feeling consistently sad, losing interest in activities she once enjoyed, and having difficulty sleeping for the past three weeks. What is the most appropriate action for the Prenatal Wellness Coach?",

                "Develop a detailed stress management plan including exercise and diet changes.",
                "Acknowledge her feelings and strongly recommend she speak with her healthcare provider or a mental health professional for assessment.",
                "Reassure her that these feelings are normal in pregnancy and will likely pass."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While some emotional fluctuations are normal, persistent symptoms like those described (anhedonia, sleep disturbance, sadness) for an extended period are red flags for potential perinatal mood disorders and warrant a referral to a qualified mental health professional or healthcare provider."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A client states, 'I'm just so tired all the time, I can't seem to get anything done.' Using a reflective listening technique from the 'Listening & Learning' (L) phase of BLOOM, which response would be most effective?",
            "options": [
                "'You should try to get more sleep.'",
                "'So, you're feeling overwhelmed by fatigue and finding it difficult to manage your tasks.'",
                "'Everyone gets tired in pregnancy; it's normal.'",
                "'What exactly do you mean by 'tired'?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening involves paraphrasing or mirroring the client's statement to show understanding and encourage further elaboration. Option B accurately reflects the client's expressed feelings and situation."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "A client sets a goal: 'I want to eat healthier during my pregnancy.' Applying the SMART goal framework taught in Lesson 8, what aspect is most clearly missing from this goal to make it effective and actionable?",

                "Specificity (S)",
                "Measurability (M)",

                "Time-bound (T)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The goal 'eat healthier' is vague. It lacks specificity (what 'healthier' means, e.g., 'increase vegetable intake by two servings daily,' 'reduce processed foods to once a week'). While it also lacks measurability and time-bound elements, specificity is the most immediate missing component to even begin to define 'healthier' effectively."

                "Ensuring sustained positive habits post-pregnancy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Optimize' phase is where the coach and client collaboratively develop and implement tailored wellness strategies and action plans to enhance various aspects of prenatal health, moving towards specific, measurable goals."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client, after reviewing her dietary intake with her coach, is found to have suboptimal folate consumption. According to prenatal nutrition guidelines, what is the recommended daily intake of folate (or folic acid supplement) for pregnant individuals to reduce the risk of neural tube defects?",

                "100 mcg",

                "1000 mcg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The recommended daily intake of folate (or folic acid from supplements) for pregnant individuals is 400-600 mcg, ideally starting prior to conception and continuing through the first trimester, to significantly reduce the risk of neural tube defects."
