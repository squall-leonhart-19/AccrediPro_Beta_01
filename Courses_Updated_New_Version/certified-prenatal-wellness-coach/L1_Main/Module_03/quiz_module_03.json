            "question": "A pregnant client at 28 weeks, previously active, asks about starting a new high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program. According to ACOG guidelines, what is the most appropriate advice for a prenatal wellness coach to provide?",
            "options": [
                "It is generally not recommended to initiate new high-intensity activities during the third trimester, especially if not previously accustomed to them.",
                "HIIT is safe as long as her heart rate stays below 140 bpm.",
                "She can start, but should only do exercises in a supine position.",
                "High-intensity exercise should be avoided entirely during pregnancy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While maintaining activity is encouraged, ACOG guidelines generally advise against initiating new high-intensity activities or significantly increasing exercise intensity during pregnancy, especially in the later trimesters, if the individual was not accustomed to it pre-pregnancy. The focus should be on maintaining current fitness levels and modifying exercises as pregnancy progresses, prioritizing safety and comfort. Heart rate targets are no longer the primary measure; RPE (Rating of Perceived Exertion) is preferred."

            "question": "Which of the following micronutrients is critically important for preventing neural tube defects and should be supplemented, ideally starting at least one month pre-conception, with a recommended daily intake of 400-800 mcg for most pregnant individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Iron",
                "Calcium",
                "Folic Acid (Folate)",
                "Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Folic acid (the synthetic form of folate) is crucial for early fetal neurological development and significantly reduces the risk of neural tube defects. The CDC recommends 400 mcg daily for all women of childbearing age, increasing to 600 mcg during pregnancy, with some guidelines suggesting up to 800 mcg. Iron is vital for preventing anemia, calcium for bone health, and Vitamin D for bone health and immune function, but folic acid is specifically linked to neural tube defect prevention."

            "question": "A client in her second trimester reports persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed, significant fatigue, and difficulty concentrating for the past three weeks. What is the most appropriate initial action for a prenatal wellness coach?",
            "options": [
                "Advise her to try deep breathing exercises and meditation to improve her mood.",
                "Suggest increasing her physical activity to boost endorphins.",
                "Recommend she discuss these symptoms with her healthcare provider for screening for Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs).",
                "Tell her these feelings are normal due to hormonal changes in pregnancy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described (persistent sadness, anhedonia, fatigue, concentration issues) are red flags for Perinatal Depression, a type of PMAD. While mindfulness and exercise can be beneficial for general well-being, a wellness coach's primary responsibility in this scenario is to recognize potential mental health concerns and strongly advise the client to seek professional medical evaluation from her healthcare provider. Dismissing these as 'normal' or only suggesting lifestyle changes without professional assessment would be irresponsible."

            "question": "When discussing optimal sleep positions for pregnant individuals, especially in the second and third trimesters, which position is generally recommended to maximize blood flow to the uterus and fetus, and why?",
            "options": [
                "Sleeping on the back (supine) to keep the spine aligned.",
                "Sleeping on the stomach until it becomes uncomfortable.",
                "Sleeping on the left side to prevent compression of the inferior vena cava.",
                "Sleeping on the right side to aid digestion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleeping on the left side is widely recommended in the second and third trimesters because it helps prevent the growing uterus from compressing the inferior vena cava, a major vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body back to the heart. This compression can reduce blood flow to the uterus, placenta, and fetus, and can also cause maternal symptoms like dizziness or shortness of breath. While sleeping on the right side is generally acceptable, the left side is often preferred for optimal circulation."

            "question": "A client is concerned about environmental toxins. Which common class of chemicals, often found in plastics (like water bottles and food containers) and can linings, is known to be an endocrine disruptor and should be minimized during pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)",
                "Lead",
                "Bisphenol A (BPA)",
                "Dioxins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical commonly found in various plastics, including food and beverage containers, and the linings of some cans. Exposure during pregnancy is a concern due to its potential impact on fetal development. While PCBs, lead, and dioxins are also harmful environmental toxins, BPA is specifically prevalent in everyday plastic products and frequently highlighted in discussions about reducing endocrine disruptor exposure."

            "question": "Which relaxation technique involves systematically tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups throughout the body, helping to reduce physical tension and promote mental calm?",
            "options": [
                "Diaphragmatic breathing",
                "Guided imagery",
                "Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)",
                "Mindful walking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a stress management technique where you consciously tense and then relax specific muscle groups. This practice helps individuals become more aware of physical tension and learn to release it, leading to a state of deep relaxation. Diaphragmatic breathing, guided imagery, and mindful walking are also effective relaxation techniques, but they do not involve the systematic tensing and relaxing of muscles in the same way PMR does."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing frequent heartburn during her third trimester. Which practical dietary modification would a wellness coach most likely suggest to help alleviate this discomfort?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming larger meals less frequently.",
                "Drinking more carbonated beverages.",
                "Avoiding trigger foods like spicy or fatty foods, and eating smaller, more frequent meals.",
                "Lying down immediately after eating to aid digestion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heartburn is common in pregnancy due to hormonal changes relaxing the esophageal sphincter and the growing uterus pressing on the stomach. Practical strategies include identifying and avoiding trigger foods (often spicy, fatty, acidic foods, or caffeine), eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding lying down immediately after eating to prevent reflux. Consuming larger meals or carbonated beverages would likely exacerbate symptoms."

            "question": "When supporting a client in building a stronger support system, what communication strategy is most effective for addressing unsolicited advice or unhelpful comments from family members?",
            "options": [
                "Ignoring the comments and hoping they stop.",
                "Confronting family members aggressively to assert boundaries.",
                "Using 'I' statements to express feelings and setting clear, respectful boundaries.",
                "Withdrawing from family interactions altogether."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using 'I' statements (e.g., 'I feel overwhelmed when...') is a key component of assertive and respectful communication. It allows the pregnant individual to express their feelings and needs without placing blame, which can help in setting healthy boundaries with family members who offer unsolicited advice. Aggressive confrontation or complete withdrawal can damage relationships, while ignoring the issue often leads to continued frustration."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Beyond folic acid, which other key nutrient is essential for preventing maternal anemia and supporting increased blood volume during pregnancy, with recommendations often including a daily supplement of 27 mg?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Iron",
                "Zinc",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron is crucial during pregnancy due to the significant increase in maternal blood volume and the needs of the developing fetus and placenta. Iron deficiency anemia is common and can lead to fatigue, weakness, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The recommended daily intake for pregnant women is 27 mg, often requiring supplementation. While Vitamin C aids iron absorption, and Zinc and Magnesium are important, iron is the primary nutrient for preventing maternal anemia."

            "question": "How does regular moderate-intensity exercise contribute to stress reduction and improved emotional well-being during pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "By significantly increasing cortisol levels, making the body more resilient to stress.",
                "By diverting blood flow from the brain, reducing overthinking.",
                "By releasing endorphins, improving mood, and providing a sense of accomplishment.",
                "By suppressing the immune system, leading to a calmer state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regular moderate-intensity exercise is a powerful stress reliever. It stimulates the release of endorphins, natural mood elevators that can reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, exercise provides a healthy outlet for energy, improves body image, enhances sleep quality, and offers a sense of accomplishment, all contributing to better emotional well-being. It does not significantly increase cortisol in a detrimental way, divert blood flow from the brain in a negative sense, or suppress the immune system to achieve calmness."
