                "It is a detailed script that guarantees a specific birth outcome and ensures no deviations.",
                "It is a set of preferences, values, and communication tools designed to guide care, remaining flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances while prioritizing client involvement.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A birth plan is a communication tool for preferences, not a prediction or rigid demand.
