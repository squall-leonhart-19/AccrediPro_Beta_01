            "question": "During the initial client consultation for a prenatal wellness coach, what is considered outside the defined scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnosing gestational diabetes based on client symptoms.",
                "Co-creating a personalized movement plan for safe exercise.",
                "Providing evidence-based education on prenatal nutrition.",
                "Referring a client to a registered dietitian for specialized dietary needs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diagnosing medical conditions like gestational diabetes falls strictly within the scope of a medical professional, not a prenatal wellness coach. Coaches educate, support, and refer, but do not diagnose or treat medical conditions."

            "question": "A client in her first trimester reports significant fatigue and morning sickness. Based on physiological changes, which factor is most likely contributing to her fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "Increased lung capacity and improved oxygen utilization.",
                "Decreased metabolic rate due to hormonal changes.",
                "The significant increase in progesterone levels and metabolic demands.",
                "Reduced blood volume leading to lower oxygen transport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first trimester is characterized by a surge in progesterone, which has sedative effects, and increased metabolic demands as the body begins to support the growing fetus, both contributing to profound fatigue. Blood volume actually increases, and lung capacity changes are more prominent later."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "When conducting a holistic nutritional assessment, a coach learns the client avoids all dairy due to lactose intolerance. What is a crucial consideration for the coach regarding this information?",

                "Refer the client directly to an endocrinologist."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A coach should assess if the client is meeting their nutritional needs, especially for critical nutrients like calcium and Vitamin D, through alternative dietary sources (e.g., fortified plant milks, leafy greens, fortified cereals) or discuss with their healthcare provider about supplementation. The coach does not prescribe supplements or advise medical treatment."

                "Reflecting her feelings, such as 'It sounds like you're feeling a lot of worry about the upcoming birth, and it's hard to focus.'",
                "Sharing a personal anecdote about your own birthing experience.",
                "Shifting the conversation to a lighter topic to reduce her stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflecting feelings demonstrates active listening by showing the client you understand and acknowledge their emotional state, encouraging them to elaborate further. Providing reassurance, sharing personal stories, or changing topics can invalidate their feelings or shift focus away from their needs."

                "To prescribe a specific exercise routine based on the meta-analysis.",
                "To interpret the research findings and explain the general benefits and safe guidelines for exercise, tailored to the client's individual context.",
                "To dismiss the research if it contradicts the client's current beliefs.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Continue coaching on other wellness areas, assuming it's a normal pregnancy discomfort."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Severe, persistent pain requires medical evaluation. A prenatal wellness coach should recognize their limits of competence and refer the client to appropriate healthcare professionals (e.g., OB/GYN, pelvic floor physical therapist) for diagnosis and treatment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining confidentiality, recognizing the need for specialized care, and making appropriate referrals are core ethical responsibilities. The other options represent boundary violations (babysitting, sharing excessive personal info) or conflicts of interest (commission-based recommendations)."

Exercises like pelvic tilts, bird-dog, and side planks are safer and more effective for strengthening the deep core muscles and supporting the back during pregnancy."

            "explanation": "A coach should educate clients on evidence-based guidelines for healthy weight gain, emphasizing overall wellness, and explore the psychological aspects of body image and anxiety without providing medical diagnoses or restrictive plans. Weight management interventions are outside the coach's scope, but supportive education is appropriate."
