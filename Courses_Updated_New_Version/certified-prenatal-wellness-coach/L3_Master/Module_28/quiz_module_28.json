            "question": "A client at 28 weeks gestation reports sudden, severe abdominal pain, accompanied by heavy vaginal bleeding. As a prenatal wellness coach, what is your immediate and most critical advice?",
            "options": [
                "Advise them to proceed directly to the nearest emergency room or call emergency services immediately.",
                "Suggest they monitor their symptoms at home for an hour and then call their obstetrician if it worsens.",
                "Recommend lying down, drinking plenty of water, and applying a warm compress to the abdomen.",
                "Advise a gentle abdominal massage to alleviate the pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sudden severe abdominal pain with heavy vaginal bleeding in the third trimester is a critical red flag for conditions like placental abruption, which requires immediate emergency medical attention. Delaying care can have severe consequences for both mother and baby."

            "question": "A client, 6 weeks postpartum, scores high on a validated screening tool for severe postpartum depression and discloses passive suicidal ideation (e.g., 'I wish I wouldn't wake up') without a specific plan. What is the coach's primary and most urgent responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Schedule an immediate follow-up coaching session to explore these feelings further.",
                "Encourage the client to talk to their partner or a trusted friend for support.",
                "Facilitate immediate connection to emergency mental health services or instruct the client to go to the nearest emergency department.",
                "Suggest engaging in self-care activities like meditation and light exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Any expression of suicidal ideation, even passive, indicates a mental health crisis requiring immediate professional intervention. The coach's primary responsibility is to ensure the client's safety by facilitating urgent access to mental health professionals or emergency services, as per the principles discussed in L3."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to typical professional guidelines and legal requirements, under which circumstance is a prenatal wellness coach legally obligated to break client confidentiality and make a mandated report?",
            "options": [
                "The client expresses general dissatisfaction with their pregnancy experience.",
                "The client discloses they are experiencing intimate partner violence where children are also at risk of harm.",
                "The client discusses marital difficulties and considers separation from their partner.",
                "The client admits to occasional recreational drug use that does not directly impact the safety of a child."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mandated reporting typically applies to situations where there is a reasonable suspicion of child abuse, neglect, or harm, or when a client expresses intent to harm themselves or others. Intimate partner violence where children are at risk falls under this category, as discussed in L5 on Ethical Dilemmas and Mandated Reporting."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client at 34 weeks gestation, with a history of gestational hypertension, calls reporting a persistent, severe headache, new onset visual disturbances (e.g., 'seeing spots'), and epigastric pain. Which medical crisis might these symptoms collectively indicate, requiring immediate medical evaluation?",
            "options": [
                "Gestational diabetes exacerbation.",
                "Severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.",
                "Normal third-trimester discomfort and anxiety.",
                "A common migraine attack."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These symptoms (severe headache, visual changes, epigastric pain) are classic indicators of severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, which are life-threatening conditions requiring urgent medical intervention. This aligns with the content on identifying medical crises in L2."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "When supporting a client who has experienced a stillbirth, which statement is generally considered unhelpful and should be avoided by a prenatal wellness coach?",
            "options": [
                "\"I'm so incredibly sorry for your loss. This must be an unimaginable pain.\"",
                "\"At least you know you can get pregnant again, and you're still young.\"",
                "\"What can I do to support you right now, or what do you need most?\"",
                "\"It's okay to feel whatever you're feeling. There's no right or wrong way to grieve.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phrases like 'At least you know you can get pregnant again' minimize the client's current grief and loss, suggesting their current pain is less valid. Effective grief support, as outlined in L4, focuses on validation, empathy, and active listening, avoiding platitudes or attempts to find a 'silver lining'."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A coach is working with a client who lives in a low-income neighborhood identified as a 'food desert' with limited access to fresh, healthy food and unreliable public transportation. The client is struggling to maintain adequate nutrition during pregnancy. Which coaching strategy best addresses the Social Determinants of Health in this situation?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a detailed, personalized meal plan that requires specific, hard-to-find ingredients.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), as discussed in L6, involves recognizing and mitigating systemic barriers. Connecting the client to community resources directly tackles the issues of food access and transportation, empowering them to overcome these challenges."

            "question": "A prenatal client has a complex medical history, including well-managed Crohn's disease and Type 1 Diabetes. As their wellness coach, what is a crucial aspect of providing effective support for this unique pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "Advising the client to discontinue most of their medications to avoid potential fetal harm.",
                "Focusing solely on diet and exercise, assuming these will manage all complex conditions.",
                "Emphasizing close collaboration with their entire medical team (gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, obstetrician) to integrate wellness strategies with medical management.",
                "Encouraging the client to rely primarily on anecdotal advice from online forums."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For clients with complex medical histories (L7), effective coaching requires an integrated approach. Close collaboration and communication with the client's medical team are paramount to ensure wellness strategies complement, rather than conflict with, their ongoing medical management and medication regimens."

            "question": "Following a traumatic emergency C-section and a challenging neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay, a client expresses feelings of detachment from their baby, recurring nightmares, and intense anxiety whenever they recall the birth. What post-crisis support strategy is most appropriate for the coach to recommend?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting they try to 'move on' and focus on the positive aspects of having a healthy baby.",
                "Recommending a referral to a trauma-informed therapist or perinatal psychologist specializing in birth trauma.",
                "Advising them to suppress these feelings and focus on self-care activities like manicures and massages.",
                "Encouraging them to share their story repeatedly with anyone who will listen, without professional guidance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Symptoms like detachment, nightmares, and intense anxiety following a traumatic event suggest potential Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or significant psychological distress. As covered in L8, the most appropriate coach action is to facilitate a referral to specialized mental health support, such as a trauma-informed therapist."

            "question": "A client at 36 weeks gestation calls their coach reporting a sudden gush of fluid from the vagina and regular contractions occurring every 3-5 minutes. What is the most appropriate immediate instruction for the coach to give?",
            "options": [
                "Advise them to take a warm bath to see if the contractions subside.",
                "Instruct them to call their obstetrician's office during business hours to schedule an appointment.",
                "Tell them to go to the nearest emergency room immediately or call emergency services.",
                "Suggest they wait an hour to see if the symptoms progress before taking any action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A sudden gush of fluid with regular contractions at 36 weeks gestation indicates likely rupture of membranes and active labor, which requires immediate medical assessment. This is an emergent situation requiring emergency care, not delayed contact with an OB office or self-monitoring, as discussed in L1 and L2."

            "question": "During a coaching engagement, a client expresses deep gratitude and offers their coach an expensive piece of jewelry as a personal gift, also asking for advice on a non-pregnancy-related financial matter. What ethical principle is most directly challenged by this situation?",
            "options": [
                "Client confidentiality and privacy.",
                "Maintaining professional boundaries and avoiding dual relationships.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Accepting significant gifts or providing advice outside the scope of prenatal wellness coaching (e.g., financial advice) can blur professional boundaries and create a dual relationship, compromising the objective nature of the coaching relationship. L5 emphasizes the importance of maintaining clear professional boundaries."
