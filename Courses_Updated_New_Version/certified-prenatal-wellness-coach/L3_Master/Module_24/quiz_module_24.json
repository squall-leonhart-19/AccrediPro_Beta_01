            "question": "During an advanced holistic assessment, a client reveals a history of severe anxiety disorders, a recent job loss, and expresses significant fear regarding childbirth due to a previous traumatic birth experience. Which of these factors, combined, would be the MOST critical to flag for immediate consideration in risk stratification and necessitate a multidisciplinary team discussion?",
            "options": [
                "The combination of severe anxiety, recent job loss, and history of traumatic birth, indicating high psychosocial and mental health vulnerability.",
                "The history of severe anxiety disorders and recent job loss, as financial stress is a primary driver of poor prenatal outcomes.",
                "The previous traumatic birth experience alone, as it directly impacts current childbirth fears.",
                "The recent job loss, as it suggests an unstable financial situation which could lead to non-compliance with recommendations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The most critical aspect for immediate consideration and multidisciplinary discussion is the interplay of psychosocial stressors (anxiety, job loss) with a history of birth trauma. This combination significantly increases the risk for perinatal mood disorders, re-traumatization, and potentially complex birth experiences, requiring a truly holistic and coordinated approach beyond what a coach can provide alone. While other options highlight important individual factors, their combined impact is paramount in advanced risk stratification."

            "question": "A core principle of Trauma-Informed Prenatal Coaching is 'Safety.' Which of the following best exemplifies a coach demonstrating this principle?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a detailed, prescriptive plan for diet and exercise to ensure physical well-being.",
                "Ensuring the client has full control over the coaching environment, session topics, and pacing, and explicitly communicating confidentiality.",
                "Focusing exclusively on physiological health markers to avoid triggering emotional responses.",
                "Sharing personal stories of overcoming trauma to build rapport and demonstrate empathy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Demonstrating 'Safety' in trauma-informed care involves creating both physical and psychological safety. This includes empowering the client with control over their engagement, respecting their boundaries, ensuring predictability, and upholding strict confidentiality. This approach helps to rebuild trust and agency, which are often compromised in individuals with trauma histories."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A client expresses, 'I know I <em>should</em> be eating healthier, but I'm just so tired, and fast food is so convenient right now.' Using Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques, which response best reflects 'Reflective Listening' to elicit 'change talk'?",
            "options": [
                "'It sounds like you're caught between wanting to eat better and the reality of your current fatigue and need for convenience.'",
                "'Have you considered meal prepping on the weekends to save time during the week?'",
                "'Many people struggle with this; what small step do you think you could realistically take this week?'",
                "'It's important to prioritize nutrition for your baby's health, even when you're tired.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening involves mirroring back the client's statement to show understanding and allow them to elaborate or clarify. This specific reflection captures the client's ambivalence, which is key to eliciting change talk by allowing them to hear their own conflicting thoughts and potentially lean into the 'should' aspect themselves. The other options are advice-giving, questioning, or direct persuasion, which are less effective for eliciting change talk in MI."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A prenatal client confides in you about experiencing persistent, intrusive thoughts about harming her baby, alongside severe sleep disturbances and feelings of hopelessness, which began two weeks postpartum. She has not shared this with her OB-GYN. As a Certified Prenatal Wellness Coach, what is your most appropriate and immediate course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Advise her to try relaxation techniques and monitor her symptoms, reassuring her that these thoughts are common.",
                "Immediately refer her to a perinatal mental health specialist (e.g., therapist, psychiatrist) and strongly encourage her to inform her OB-GYN, while offering continued supportive coaching within your scope.",
                "Focus your coaching on sleep hygiene and stress reduction, as these are within your scope and may alleviate her symptoms.",
                "Document her symptoms and schedule an emergency session to explore the root causes of these thoughts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intrusive thoughts of harm, severe sleep disturbance, and hopelessness are significant red flags for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, potentially postpartum psychosis, which requires urgent clinical intervention. While a coach can offer support, these symptoms are outside the coaching scope and necessitate immediate referral to a qualified mental health professional. Encouraging communication with her OB-GYN ensures a comprehensive medical and mental health approach. Delaying referral or attempting to treat these symptoms within a coaching scope would be unethical and potentially harmful."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "A long-term client, due in two weeks, asks if you would be willing to be her birth doula, offering to pay extra for your services beyond the coaching package. You are a trained birth doula, but your coaching agreement explicitly defines your role as a wellness coach, not a birth attendant. How should you navigate this ethical dilemma?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the offer, as you are qualified and it strengthens your bond, ensuring you provide continuous support.",
                "Decline the offer, explaining that it represents a dual relationship and falls outside the established professional boundaries of your current coaching agreement, but offer a referral to another trusted doula.",
                "Accept, but only after revising your coaching contract to include doula services and adjusting your liability insurance.",
                "Inform her that you can be present at the birth as a 'friend' to avoid professional boundary issues, without accepting payment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Accepting the doula role would create a dual relationship, blurring professional boundaries and potentially complicating the coaching dynamic, especially given the existing coaching agreement. Even though qualified, maintaining clear boundaries is crucial for ethical practice. The most appropriate action is to politely decline, explain the boundary, and provide a referral to ensure the client receives the support she needs from another qualified professional, thus upholding your ethical obligations and professional integrity."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "A client diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes (GDM) at 28 weeks, after being referred by her OB-GYN, expresses feeling overwhelmed and guilty about her diagnosis. Her blood sugar readings are consistently elevated despite dietary changes she's trying. As her coach, what is the most effective approach to support her, considering her complex condition?",
            "options": [
                "Strictly review her food diary and provide a more restrictive meal plan, emphasizing the importance of adherence for the baby's health.",
                "Focus on stress reduction techniques and encourage light exercise, assuming her diet is already being managed by a dietitian.",
                "Collaborate with her healthcare team (e.g., dietitian, endocrinologist) to understand medical recommendations, then help her integrate those into her lifestyle through goal setting, problem-solving barriers, and addressing emotional impact, while reinforcing self-efficacy.",
                "Recommend specific herbal supplements known to help regulate blood sugar, as a complementary approach to her medical treatment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For complex conditions like GDM, the coach's role is not to provide medical advice but to support the client in adhering to and integrating medical recommendations into their daily life. Collaboration with the healthcare team ensures alignment. Addressing emotional impact, problem-solving, and building self-efficacy empowers the client without overstepping the coaching scope. Options A and D involve giving medical advice or overly restrictive directives, while B ignores the central issue of blood sugar management."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "After three months of coaching, a client who initially struggled with low energy and poor sleep reports feeling much better, having more energy, and sleeping soundly. However, she now expresses frustration with her partner regarding household chores and childcare division, which is causing significant marital strain. How should a master prenatal coach dynamically adapt the intervention design?",
            "options": [
                "Continue focusing on energy and sleep, as these were the initial presenting issues and are now showing improvement.",
                "Shift the focus entirely to couples counseling strategies, providing specific advice on communication and conflict resolution.",
                "Acknowledge the progress made on initial goals, then pivot to explore the client's current priorities and challenges related to relationship dynamics, setting new, client-led goals within the coaching scope (e.g., communication skills, boundary setting for self-care).",
                "Refer the client immediately to a marriage counselor, as relationship issues are outside the scope of prenatal wellness coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dynamic adaptation involves recognizing the client's evolving needs and priorities. While initial goals were met, new challenges have emerged. A master coach acknowledges progress, then collaboratively explores the new issues within the coaching framework, helping the client identify how these impact her well-being and setting new, relevant goals (e.g., improving communication, advocating for her needs) without becoming a couples counselor. Referral is an option if the issues are severe and beyond coaching scope, but initial adaptation is preferred."

            "question": "When building a master prenatal coaching practice, what is a crucial ethical consideration regarding marketing and client acquisition?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing marketing efforts exclusively on high-income clients to ensure profitability and sustained practice growth.",
                "Making unsubstantiated claims about guaranteed outcomes or cures for pregnancy complications to attract a wider client base.",
                "Clearly defining the scope of services, qualifications, and limitations of coaching, and avoiding any language that could be misinterpreted as medical or therapeutic advice.",
                "Offering discounted or free services to friends and family to gain initial testimonials and build a referral network quickly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing requires transparency and integrity. Clearly defining the scope of practice, qualifications, and limitations ensures clients have accurate expectations and prevents misrepresentation of services as medical or therapeutic. Unsubstantiated claims (B) are unethical, focusing only on high-income clients (A) can limit accessibility and impact, and offering free services to friends/family (D) can create dual relationships and blur professional boundaries, potentially compromising objectivity and future client relationships."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client with a known history of sexual trauma begins to withdraw during a discussion about intimacy in pregnancy, becoming visibly agitated, avoiding eye contact, and giving terse, one-word answers. As her coach, what is the most appropriate trauma-informed response?",
            "options": [
                "Gently push her to elaborate, explaining that discussing intimacy is an important part of holistic prenatal wellness.",
                "Shift the topic immediately to something neutral and less triggering, giving her space without explicitly addressing the change in her demeanor.",
                "Acknowledge the shift in her demeanor, offer her a choice to pause, change the topic, or end the session, and reassure her that her comfort and safety are paramount.",
                "Suggest she might benefit from individual therapy to process her past trauma before continuing with coaching on sensitive topics."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a trauma-informed approach, recognizing and responding to signs of distress (withdrawal, agitation) is critical. The best response is to gently acknowledge the change, offer choices to re-establish control and safety, and explicitly prioritize her comfort. This empowers the client and avoids re-traumatization. Options A and D are confrontational or dismissive, while B, while trying to be helpful, misses an opportunity to empower the client and acknowledge her experience."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "According to current research, advanced maternal age (AMA), often defined as pregnancy at or after 35 years, is associated with a statistically significant increase in certain risks. Which of the following conditions sees the most prominent increase in incidence specifically linked to AMA, requiring particular coaching attention?",
            "options": [
                "Gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.",
                "Hyperemesis gravidarum and morning sickness.",
                "Placenta previa and postpartum hemorrhage.",
                "Fetal macrosomia and shoulder dystocia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While AMA is associated with various increased risks, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia show a particularly prominent and statistically significant increase in incidence. For example, the risk of gestational diabetes can be 2-3 times higher, and preeclampsia risk can also be significantly elevated in women of advanced maternal age. A master coach would be particularly attuned to supporting clients in lifestyle modifications and monitoring related to these conditions, in collaboration with their medical team."
