            "question": "What is the primary distinction between professional supervision and mentoring in the context of prenatal wellness coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Supervision focuses on direct client outcomes, ethical practice, and competence, while mentoring emphasizes career development, skill mastery, and professional growth.",
                "Supervision is always a mandatory, formal process, whereas mentoring is always a voluntary, informal relationship.",
                "Mentoring involves a formal contractual agreement outlining specific deliverables, while supervision typically does not.",
                "Supervisors are exclusively responsible for the supervisee's client caseload, whereas mentors offer general advice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Professional supervision primarily ensures ethical practice, client safety, and the supervisee's competence in direct client work. Mentoring, while also fostering growth, focuses more broadly on career trajectory, skill enhancement, and professional identity development."

            "question": "A Certified Prenatal Wellness Coach (CPWC) supervisee shares confidential client information during a supervision session, including identifiable details, without the client's explicit written consent. Which ethical imperative is primarily violated?",
            "options": [
                "Professional competence, as the supervisee may lack understanding of confidentiality.",
                "Client informed consent and confidentiality, as identifiable information was shared without permission.",
                "Avoiding dual relationships with the client.",
                "Maintaining appropriate professional boundaries with the supervisor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sharing identifiable client information without their explicit, informed consent is a direct violation of client confidentiality. Ethical guidelines mandate safeguarding client privacy, and specific consent is required for discussing cases in ways that could identify the client, even in supervision."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "According to AccrediPro Academy guidelines for effective supervisory dynamics, feedback should ideally be:",
            "options": [
                "Primarily critical, focusing only on areas of weakness for immediate correction.",
                "Given only when specifically requested by the supervisee to avoid imposing opinions.",
                "Specific, timely, balanced (highlighting strengths and areas for growth), and focused on observable behaviors or outcomes.",
                "Delivered exclusively in written format to ensure legal documentation and formality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective feedback in supervision is constructive and actionable. It should be specific (addressing particular behaviors), timely (close to the event), balanced (acknowledging strengths and areas for development), and focused on observable actions rather than personal traits, to facilitate learning and growth."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A CPWC is seeking to specialize in supporting clients with high-risk pregnancies. How would a mentor most effectively facilitate this specialization, according to principles of leveraging mentoring for growth?",
            "options": [
                "By directly assigning high-risk clients from their own caseload to the mentee.",
                "By providing direct answers to all clinical questions related to high-risk cases without requiring the mentee to research.",
                "By sharing relevant resources, networking opportunities, guiding the mentee to advanced training, and discussing complex case scenarios.",
                "By conducting all client sessions for the mentee until competence is fully achieved in this specialization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A mentor's role is to guide, empower, and facilitate the mentee's growth. This includes connecting them with relevant resources, opportunities, and knowledge, enabling the mentee to independently develop their specialized skills and expertise, rather than directly performing tasks for them."

            "options": [
                "Presenting only successful client outcomes to consistently demonstrate competence.",
                "Focusing solely on the client's symptoms, diagnosis, and medical history without personal reflection.",
                "Including their own emotional responses, cognitive processes, decision-making rationale, and areas of challenge encountered during the case.",
                "Providing a comprehensive literature review on the client's condition, separate from the coaching intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective reflective practice involves a deep dive into the supervisee's internal experience alongside the client's case. This includes examining one's own thoughts, feelings, assumptions, and decision-making processes, which are crucial for self-awareness and professional development."

            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "A supervisor observes a supervisee consistently demonstrating poor time management, disorganized client records, and missed follow-ups, potentially impacting client care. What is the supervisor's initial and most appropriate course of action, as per best practice guidelines for managing challenging situations?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately report the supervisee to the professional licensing board for negligence.",
                "Terminate the supervisory relationship without discussion, citing a breach of professional standards.",
                "Address the concerns directly with the supervisee, establish clear expectations, and collaboratively develop a remediation plan with measurable goals.",
                "Assume the supervisee will self-correct over time and monitor the situation passively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Best practice dictates that a supervisor first addresses concerns directly and constructively with the supervisee. This includes providing clear feedback, setting expectations, and working together on a remediation plan. Escalation to licensing bodies is typically reserved for severe, unaddressed, or persistent issues after initial efforts have failed."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A robust PPDP relies on SMART goals. This framework ensures that objectives are clear, quantifiable, realistic, aligned with professional aspirations, and have defined deadlines, making the plan effective for tracking progress and achieving desired outcomes."

                "It completely replaces the need for formal individual supervision with a more informal setting.",
                "It guarantees a cost-free alternative to all forms of professional development and training.",
                "It offers diverse perspectives, shared problem-solving, reduced professional isolation, and a strong sense of professional community.",
                "It allows for the informal discussion of client cases without ethical constraints or confidentiality agreements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Peer supervision fosters a supportive community where coaches can share experiences, gain diverse insights, and collaboratively address challenges. This reduces professional isolation and enhances problem-solving capabilities, though it does not replace individual formal supervision when required."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "A supervisee is struggling with imposter syndrome, despite consistently receiving positive client feedback and demonstrating strong skills. During supervision, the supervisor helps the supervisee identify cognitive distortions and reframe their self-perception of competence. This is an example of the supervisor primarily acting as a:",

                "Direct client advocate, focusing on the client's needs.",
                "Administrative gatekeeper, ensuring adherence to institutional rules.",

                "Primary therapist for the supervisee, addressing personal mental health issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While supervisors are not therapists for their supervisees, they play a crucial role in fostering the supervisee's professional identity, confidence, and ability to self-reflect. Addressing issues like imposter syndrome through reflective questioning and reframing falls within the scope of supporting professional development."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The written supervisory contract is a critical document that formally defines the parameters of the supervisory relationship. It establishes clear boundaries, roles, responsibilities, confidentiality agreements, ethical guidelines, and expectations for both the supervisor and supervisee, significantly reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and ethical breaches."
