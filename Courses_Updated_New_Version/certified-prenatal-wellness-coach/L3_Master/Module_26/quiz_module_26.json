            "question": "During an advanced client assessment, a coach identifies that a pregnant client, 'Sarah,' reports persistent dizziness, shortness of breath, and visual disturbances, especially after light activity. Based on L2, what is the most appropriate immediate action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend increasing her water intake and resting more frequently.",
                "Adjust her exercise protocol to lower intensity activities.",
                "Advise her to consult her healthcare provider immediately for medical evaluation.",
                "Suggest a diet rich in iron to address potential anemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent dizziness, shortness of breath, and visual disturbances are potential red flags during pregnancy that require immediate medical evaluation by a healthcare provider. A wellness coach must operate within their scope of practice and refer clients to medical professionals for diagnosis and treatment, as emphasized in L2 regarding advanced client assessment and identifying contraindications."

            "question": "When designing a personalized nutrition protocol for a pregnant client, which micronutrient is critically important for preventing neural tube defects and should be emphasized, particularly in the periconceptional period and early pregnancy, as discussed in L3?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D",
                "Calcium",
                "Folate",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Folate (Vitamin B9) is paramount for the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs) and is crucial during the periconceptional period and the first trimester of pregnancy. While Vitamin D, Calcium, and Iron are also vital, folate has a direct and specific role in preventing NTDs, as highlighted in L3's discussion on prenatal nutrition."

            "question": "A client in her second trimester reports significant pelvic girdle pain (PGP) when performing single-leg movements. As per L3 guidelines on movement protocols, what is the most appropriate modification a coach should suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Discontinue all lower body exercises until postpartum.",
                "Focus solely on upper body and core strengthening exercises.",
                "Modify exercises to bilateral, symmetrical movements and avoid deep squats or lunges.",
                "Increase the intensity of single-leg exercises to strengthen the supporting muscles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For clients experiencing pelvic girdle pain (PGP), modifying exercises to bilateral, symmetrical movements (e.g., squats with both feet on the ground) and avoiding deep or asymmetrical movements like single-leg lunges can significantly reduce discomfort and prevent exacerbation of symptoms. Discontinuing all lower body exercises is often unnecessary, and increasing intensity would likely worsen PGP. This aligns with L3's focus on adapting movement protocols for common prenatal discomforts."

            "question": "In L4, integrating emotional well-being, a coach is working with 'Maria,' who reports feeling overwhelmed, experiencing persistent sadness, and having difficulty sleeping for the past three weeks, distinct from typical pregnancy fatigue. What is the coach's primary responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest specific mindfulness exercises to alleviate her symptoms.",
                "Develop a detailed stress reduction plan with daily affirmations.",
                "Educate her on the commonality of perinatal mood changes and provide a list of support groups.",
                "Refer her to a qualified mental health professional for assessment and support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Maria's symptoms (persistent sadness, difficulty sleeping, feeling overwhelmed for an extended period) suggest potential perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs). As emphasized in L4, a prenatal wellness coach's primary responsibility in such cases is to refer the client to a qualified mental health professional for proper diagnosis and treatment, as this falls outside the coach's scope of practice. While mindfulness and support groups can be complementary, professional assessment is crucial."

            "options": [
                "Ensure the client adheres strictly to medical advice.",
                "Shift responsibility for medical decisions to the coach.",

                "Critique the healthcare provider's communication style."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This coaching approach directly aims to build the client's confidence and skills in communicating effectively with their healthcare providers, which is a cornerstone of client advocacy and self-efficacy. It empowers them to actively participate in their care rather than passively receiving information, aligning with the principles discussed in L5."

            "question": "When planning for the postpartum transition, as outlined in L6, which aspect is often overlooked but critical for a client's holistic recovery and well-being?",
            "options": [
                "Strict adherence to a newborn feeding schedule.",
                "Immediate return to pre-pregnancy exercise routines.",
                "Establishing a robust support network and planning for practical help.",
                "Focusing exclusively on physical recovery exercises."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing a robust support network and planning for practical help (e.g., meal preparation, childcare, household tasks) is critical but often overlooked in postpartum planning. This holistic approach, as discussed in L6, ensures the birthing parent has the emotional and physical space to recover and bond with their baby, rather than being solely focused on physical recovery or rigid schedules."

            "question": "A coach has been tracking a client's progress for six weeks, and the client consistently reports feeling fatigued and unable to meet their weekly movement goals, despite initial enthusiasm. Based on L7, what is the most appropriate next step for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Reinforce the original goals and encourage the client to push harder.",
                "Assume the client is not committed and consider terminating the program.",
                "Initiate a collaborative discussion to understand underlying barriers and adapt the program goals or strategies.",
                "Provide a strict new schedule for movement and nutrition without client input."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective program implementation and adaptation, as taught in L7, require continuous feedback and flexibility. When a client consistently struggles, the most appropriate action is to collaboratively explore the underlying reasons (e.g., changing energy levels, new discomforts, external stressors) and then adapt the program goals or strategies to better suit their current capacity and needs, ensuring the program remains sustainable and supportive."

            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach is approached by a client who asks for a specific diagnosis for her persistent nausea and recommends a prescription antiemetic. As per L8 on ethical considerations and scope of practice, what is the coach's ethical obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Research common antiemetics and suggest one based on client history.",
                "Explain that providing medical diagnoses or prescribing medication is outside the coach's scope of practice.",
                "Suggest herbal remedies as an alternative to prescription medication.",
                "Advise the client to self-diagnose using reliable online resources."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing medical diagnoses or prescribing medication falls strictly outside the scope of practice for a prenatal wellness coach. As highlighted in L8, the coach's ethical obligation is to clearly communicate these professional boundaries and refer the client to a qualified healthcare provider for medical assessment and treatment. Suggesting herbal remedies or self-diagnosis also encroaches on medical advice."

            "question": "When setting a SMART goal for 'Jessica,' a client in her first trimester, regarding hydration, which of the following best exemplifies a 'Measurable' and 'Time-bound' component, consistent with L2 and L7 principles?",
            "options": [
                "Drink more water daily.",
                "Feel less thirsty by the end of the week.",
                "Consume 80 ounces of water per day, tracked via a water bottle app, for the next two weeks.",
                "Ensure adequate hydration to support fetal development."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The option 'Consume 80 ounces of water per day, tracked via a water bottle app, for the next two weeks' is the most Measurable (80 ounces, tracked by app) and Time-bound (for the next two weeks) goal. 'Drink more water' is vague, 'Feel less thirsty' is subjective and not directly measurable by the client in a quantifiable way for tracking, and 'Ensure adequate hydration' is a general objective, not a SMART goal. This aligns with L2 on collaborative goal setting and L7 on tracking."
