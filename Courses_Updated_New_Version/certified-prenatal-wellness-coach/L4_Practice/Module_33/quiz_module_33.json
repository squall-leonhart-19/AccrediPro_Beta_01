            "question": "A Certified Prenatal Wellness Coach is working with a client who expresses severe, persistent pelvic pain and asks for a specific medical diagnosis and prescription. According to the <span class=\"highlight\">Scope of Practice</span> guidelines discussed in L1, what is the most appropriate action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a potential diagnosis based on common prenatal conditions and recommend over-the-counter pain relief.",
                "Advise the client that diagnosing medical conditions and prescribing medication is outside the coach's scope, and strongly recommend consulting with their obstetrician or a physical therapist.",
                "Suggest specific stretches and exercises that are generally safe for pelvic pain, without mentioning a referral.",
                "Research the symptoms online during the session and share potential medical insights with the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A prenatal wellness coach's scope explicitly excludes medical diagnosis and prescription. The most appropriate and ethical action is to clearly state this boundary and refer the client to a qualified healthcare professional, such as an obstetrician, midwife, or physical therapist, for medical evaluation and treatment. This upholds professional boundaries and ensures client safety."

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "In L2, we emphasized the importance of <span class=\"highlight\">Informed Consent</span>. Which of the following elements is NOT a mandatory component of a comprehensive informed consent process?",
            "options": [
                "A clear description of the services to be provided, including potential benefits and risks.",
                "Disclosure of the coach's professional qualifications, certifications, and experience.",
                "A guarantee of specific positive outcomes, such as a 'perfect birth' or 'zero weight gain'.",
                "Information regarding confidentiality, data privacy, and the client's right to withdraw consent at any time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires a clear understanding of services, qualifications, and client rights. However, guaranteeing specific positive outcomes is unethical and misleading, as individual results can vary and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the coach's control. Ethical practice dictates transparency about what a coach can and cannot promise."

            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach uses a third-party cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to store client notes, health histories, and communication logs. To ensure compliance with <span class=\"highlight\">Confidentiality and Data Privacy</span> standards (L3), what is the most critical feature the coach should verify about the EHR provider?",
            "options": [
                "The system offers a wide range of customizable templates for prenatal care plans.",
                "The provider is HIPAA-compliant (for US-based clients) or GDPR-compliant (for EU-based clients) and has a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place, if applicable.",
                "The system integrates seamlessly with social media platforms for easy client engagement.",
                "The EHR system is the cheapest option available on the market to minimize overhead costs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For secure record keeping and compliance with data privacy regulations like HIPAA or GDPR, it is paramount that any third-party service provider handling Protected Health Information (PHI) adheres to these standards. A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is a legally binding contract that ensures the vendor protects client data according to regulatory requirements, making it a critical verification point for coaches."

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "As discussed in L4 on <span class=\"highlight\">Professional Liability & Risk Management</span>, a prenatal wellness coach is developing a comprehensive risk management strategy. Which of the following is considered the foundational element for protecting against potential financial losses from client claims of negligence or malpractice?",
            "options": [
                "Maintaining meticulous client records and documentation.",
                "Purchasing professional indemnity (malpractice) insurance.",
                "Having a clear client agreement signed by all clients.",
                "Attending regular continuing education workshops."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While meticulous records, clear agreements, and continuing education are vital for risk reduction, professional indemnity (malpractice) insurance is the foundational financial safeguard. It provides coverage for legal fees, settlements, or judgments that may arise from claims of professional negligence, errors, or omissions, directly mitigating the financial impact on the coach."

        {
            "id": "q33_5",
            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach creates a social media advertisement stating, 'Our program guarantees a stress-free pregnancy and a completely natural, unmedicated birth for all participants.' Based on L5's principles of <span class=\"highlight\">Ethical Marketing and Advertising</span>, what is the primary ethical concern with this statement?",
            "options": [
                "It does not include a call to action.",
                "It uses overly optimistic language.",
                "It makes an unsubstantiated and unrealistic guarantee of outcomes that cannot be promised.",
                "It fails to mention the coach's credentials."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing prohibits making unsubstantiated guarantees, especially regarding health outcomes that are highly individual and subject to many variables beyond the coach's control. Such claims are misleading, can create false expectations, and may violate consumer protection laws. Honesty and transparency are paramount."

            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "During a coaching session, a client reveals symptoms consistent with severe prenatal depression, including thoughts of self-harm. According to L6 on <span class=\"highlight\">Navigating Referrals & Collaborative Care</span>, what is the coach's immediate and most critical responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Provide immediate counseling and coping strategies.",
                "Advise the client to 'think positive' and focus on the joy of impending motherhood.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a qualified mental health professional (e.g., psychiatrist, therapist) and potentially their obstetrician, emphasizing the urgency and offering support in connecting them.",
                "Document the conversation and continue with the planned wellness coaching session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client expresses symptoms of severe mental health distress, particularly involving self-harm, it falls outside the prenatal wellness coach's scope. The most critical responsibility is an immediate and appropriate referral to a licensed mental health professional and potentially their medical provider. This ensures the client receives specialized, urgent care beyond the coach's expertise."

        {
            "id": "q33_7",
            "question": "A client files a formal complaint against a prenatal wellness coach, alleging a breach of confidentiality. As outlined in L7 regarding <span class=\"highlight\">Handling Client Complaints & Ethical Dilemmas</span>, what should be the coach's immediate first step in addressing this complaint?",
            "options": [
                "Delete all client records related to the complaint to prevent further issues.",
                "Immediately contact a lawyer to discuss suing the client for defamation.",
                "Acknowledge receipt of the complaint, review relevant client agreements and documentation, and initiate an internal investigation or consultation with a professional body/mentor if appropriate.",
                "Publicly respond to the client's complaint on social media to defend their reputation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The initial step in handling a complaint is to acknowledge it professionally and systematically. This includes reviewing all pertinent documentation, such as client agreements and communication logs, and initiating an impartial internal review. Consulting with a professional body, mentor, or legal counsel may be necessary depending on the complaint's severity, but the first step is always a structured, documented response and investigation."

            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach is deciding on a business structure for their practice. They want to protect their personal assets from potential business liabilities. According to L8 on <span class=\"highlight\">Business Structures, Licensing, & Ongoing Compliance</span>, which business structure is generally recommended for providing this type of personal asset protection?",
            "options": [
                "Sole Proprietorship",
                "General Partnership",
                "Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Corporation",
                "Unincorporated Association"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Limited Liability Company (LLC) or a Corporation provides a legal separation between the business and the owner's personal assets. This means that in the event of a lawsuit or business debt, the owner's personal property (like their home or savings) is generally protected, unlike a sole proprietorship or general partnership where personal assets are typically at risk."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "Beyond initial setup, what is a crucial aspect of <span class=\"highlight\">Ongoing Compliance</span> for a Certified Prenatal Wellness Coach, as highlighted in L8?",
            "options": [
                "Regularly changing the business name to attract new clients.",
                "Consistently updating professional liability insurance and adhering to continuing education requirements for maintaining certification.",
                "Avoiding all client feedback to prevent complaints.",
                "Operating without a clear client agreement to foster flexibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ongoing compliance involves several key areas. Two critical ones are maintaining adequate professional liability insurance, which often requires annual renewal, and fulfilling continuing education requirements to keep certifications current and ensure the coach remains up-to-date with best practices and legal standards. This demonstrates a commitment to professional excellence and risk mitigation."

            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "A coach's client, Maria, shares highly sensitive personal information about her previous pregnancy trauma during a session. Later, the coach is approached by a local university conducting a research study on prenatal mental health and is asked to provide anonymized data from their clients. The coach believes Maria's story would be valuable. Without obtaining specific, explicit consent from Maria for research participation, sharing this data, even anonymized, would primarily violate which core ethical principle covered in L3 and L2?",
            "options": [
                "Professional Boundaries",
                "Ethical Marketing",
                "Confidentiality and Informed Consent",
                "Scope of Practice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario directly violates both confidentiality and the principles of informed consent. Even if data is anonymized, the initial collection of sensitive information was for coaching purposes, not research. To use client data for any purpose beyond the agreed-upon coaching services, explicit, informed consent must be obtained from the client specifically for that new purpose, ensuring they understand how their data will be used and can choose to opt-in or out."
