            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A new prenatal wellness coach is launching their first 8-week virtual group program. Based on L4, which marketing strategy is most likely to yield the highest initial enrollment for a niche program targeting first-time mothers in their second trimester?",

                "Purchasing email lists of pregnant individuals from third-party data brokers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 stresses the effectiveness of targeted partnerships for niche audiences. Direct referrals from trusted sources like healthcare providers or complementary wellness businesses often lead to higher conversion rates for initial launches compared to broad advertising or solely organic reach. Purchasing email lists is generally not recommended due to ethical and compliance concerns."

                "Politely interrupt the participant and ask them to hold their thoughts until the Q&A segment.",
                "Acknowledge their contribution briefly, then redirect the question to other participants or use a structured sharing technique like 'round-robin'.",
                "Allow them to continue, as their enthusiasm might encourage others indirectly to participate more.",
                "Address the issue privately with the dominant participant after the session to avoid public embarrassment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 advises acknowledging contributions while gently redirecting to ensure equitable participation. Using structured techniques or directly inviting others to speak maintains an inclusive environment without shutting down the enthusiastic participant, fostering a balanced group dynamic."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 discusses scaling strategies that decouple income from direct time.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lessons 1 and 5 underscore the paramount importance of confidentiality and establishing a safe, trusting environment in group settings. When sensitive information is shared, the coach's immediate responsibility is to reinforce these ethical boundaries and ensure participants feel secure in the shared space, rather than offering medical advice (outside scope) or abruptly ending the session."
