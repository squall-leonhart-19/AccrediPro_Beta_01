            "question": "A Certified Prenatal Wellness Coach is establishing their private practice. Which legal business structure offers personal asset protection from business liabilities, a feature not typically provided by a sole proprietorship?",
            "options": [
                "Limited Liability Company (LLC)",
                "General Partnership",

                "Non-profit Organization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An LLC (Limited Liability Company) provides personal liability protection, separating the owner's personal assets from the business's debts and legal obligations. This is a crucial advantage over a sole proprietorship, which offers no such distinction and exposes personal assets."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A prenatal wellness coach operates within a supportive, educational, and motivational scope. Diagnosing medical conditions, prescribing medication, or offering treatments for severe medical symptoms like hyperemesis gravidarum falls outside this scope. The most appropriate and ethical action is to advise immediate consultation with a qualified healthcare provider."
