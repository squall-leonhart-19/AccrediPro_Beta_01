            "options": [
                "Best available research evidence",
                "Practitioner's personal beliefs",

                "Clinical expertise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The three core pillars of Evidence-Based Practice are the best available research evidence, the practitioner's clinical expertise, and the client's values and preferences. Personal beliefs, while present, should not supersede these pillars in professional practice."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "For evaluating the efficacy of a new prenatal nutrition intervention, which research methodology typically provides the strongest level of evidence due to its ability to minimize bias and establish causality?",
            "options": [
                "Case-control study",
                "Cross-sectional study",

                "Qualitative interview study"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating intervention efficacy because they randomly assign participants to intervention and control groups, minimizing confounding variables and allowing for stronger causal inferences compared to observational studies."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PICO framework stands for Population/Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison/Control, and Outcome. The 'C' refers to the alternative intervention or control group against which the primary intervention is compared."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A study on a prenatal supplement reports a Relative Risk (RR) of <span class=\"stat-highlight\">0.6</span> (95% CI: 0.45-0.75) for reducing the incidence of gestational diabetes. What is the most accurate interpretation of this finding?",
            "options": [
                "The supplement is not statistically significant in reducing gestational diabetes.",
                "The supplement increases the risk of gestational diabetes by 40%.",
                "The supplement reduces the risk of gestational diabetes by 40%.",
                "The study found no effect, as the CI crosses 1.0."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Relative Risk (RR) less than 1.0 indicates a reduction in risk. An RR of 0.6 means the risk is 60% of what it would be without the supplement, or a 40% reduction (1 - 0.6 = 0.4). Since the 95% Confidence Interval (0.45-0.75) does not include 1.0, the finding is statistically significant, indicating a real effect."

            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach is looking for high-quality, synthesized evidence in the form of systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding exercise interventions during pregnancy. Which of the following databases would be the most appropriate primary resource?",
            "options": [
                "Google Scholar",
                "Wikipedia",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cochrane Library is renowned globally as a primary source for high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses, particularly in healthcare, making it ideal for synthesized evidence on interventions. While Google Scholar can find studies, it's not curated specifically for systematic reviews like Cochrane."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A client, Sarah (32 weeks pregnant), expresses strong cultural preferences for certain traditional remedies, despite limited scientific evidence supporting their efficacy and some potential interactions with prescribed prenatal vitamins. How should a prenatal coach best integrate evidence-based practice in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Insist Sarah stops all traditional remedies immediately due to lack of evidence.",
                "Dismiss Sarah's concerns and only recommend scientifically proven interventions.",
                "Acknowledge Sarah's cultural beliefs, discuss potential interactions and safety, and seek to integrate evidence-based practices that align with her values where safe and possible.",
                "Recommend Sarah to consult only with traditional healers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrating evidence-based practice means considering client values and preferences. A coach should acknowledge cultural beliefs, discuss potential risks and benefits transparently, and aim for a collaborative approach that respects the client's choices while prioritizing safety and evidence-supported care. Direct dismissal or insistence undermines the client-coach relationship."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "A pregnant client asks her coach about a social media post claiming that 'eating specific alkaline foods can prevent morning sickness entirely and guarantee a baby's gender.' What is the most appropriate evidence-based response from the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Confirm that alkaline diets are beneficial for preventing morning sickness.",
                "Advise the client that such claims are generally unsupported by scientific evidence and discuss reliable sources for prenatal nutrition.",
                "Suggest the client try the diet, as there's no harm in it.",
                "Tell the client to ignore all social media advice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Claims like 'guaranteeing a baby's gender' or 'entirely preventing morning sickness' through specific diets are typically red flags for pseudoscience. An evidence-based coach should gently but firmly correct misinformation, explain the lack of scientific support, and direct the client to credible sources for prenatal health information."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "The field of prenatal health research is constantly evolving. What is the primary reason for a Certified Prenatal Wellness Coach to engage in continuous professional development and stay updated with new research?",
            "options": [
                "To increase client fees",
                "To maintain professional licensure (if applicable)",
                "To ensure the provision of the most current, safe, and effective guidance to clients",
                "To network with other professionals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary ethical and professional responsibility of a prenatal wellness coach is to provide the best possible care. This necessitates staying current with the latest research to ensure the guidance offered is safe, effective, and aligns with current best practices, directly benefiting client outcomes."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "In a prenatal study investigating the effects of a new exercise program, participants in the intervention group are highly enthusiastic and believe the program will significantly improve their outcomes. This enthusiasm, potentially influencing their adherence and self-reported improvements, is an example of what type of bias?",
            "options": [
                "Selection bias",
                "Observer bias",
                "Performance bias (or Hawthorne effect)",
                "Publication bias"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario describes performance bias, often referred to as the Hawthorne effect. It occurs when participants' behavior or responses are altered simply because they know they are being observed or are receiving special attention/treatment, leading to an apparent improvement not solely attributable to the intervention itself."

            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach identifies a gap in her current client resources regarding stress management techniques for third-trimester anxiety. Following the principles of Evidence-Based Practice, what should be her initial step?",
            "options": [
                "Develop a new program based on personal experience.",
                "Search for the best available research evidence on stress management techniques for third-trimester anxiety.",
                "Ask clients what they think would work best.",
                "Consult a single, well-known expert for their opinion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The initial step in an Evidence-Based Practice approach, when identifying a knowledge gap, is to formulate a clear clinical question and then systematically search for the best available research evidence to answer it. Personal experience and expert opinion are components of EBP but come after a thorough review of scientific literature."
