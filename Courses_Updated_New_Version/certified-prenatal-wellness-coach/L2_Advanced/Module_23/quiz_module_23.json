            "question": "A pregnant client is diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes (GD) and seeks nutritional guidance to manage blood glucose levels. Which of the following advanced nutritional strategies would be most appropriate for her?",
            "options": [
                "Significantly increasing saturated fat intake to promote satiety.",
                "Emphasizing complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, distributed across small, frequent meals.",
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates from her diet to prevent glucose spikes.",
                "Focusing solely on high-protein shakes as meal replacements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For Gestational Diabetes (GD), managing carbohydrate intake is crucial. Emphasizing complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, distributed throughout the day in small, frequent meals, helps stabilize blood sugar and prevent post-meal spikes. Eliminating all carbohydrates is not sustainable or healthy, and excessive saturated fat or relying solely on protein shakes is not a balanced approach for GD management."

            "question": "A wellness coach is developing an exercise plan for a client with a high-risk pregnancy. Which of the following conditions represents an absolute contraindication to exercise, requiring immediate consultation with her obstetrician before any physical activity?",
            "options": [
                "Gestational hypertension well-controlled with medication.",
                "Mild preeclampsia with stable blood pressure.",
                "Placenta previa diagnosed after 20 weeks gestation.",
                "Well-managed chronic bronchitis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Placenta previa diagnosed after 20 weeks gestation is an absolute contraindication for exercise due to the significant risk of hemorrhage. While other conditions like gestational hypertension or mild preeclampsia may require exercise modifications and medical clearance, they are not typically absolute contraindications if well-managed. Well-managed chronic bronchitis would also require medical clearance but is generally not an absolute contraindication."

            "question": "Sarah, a client in her third trimester, expresses feeling persistently sad, has lost interest in activities she once enjoyed, and reports difficulty sleeping even when tired. She mentions these feelings started about a month ago and are worsening. As her prenatal wellness coach, what is the most appropriate initial action?",
            "options": [
                "Advise her to try an over-the-counter herbal supplement for mood enhancement.",
                "Suggest she push through these feelings, as they are common in late pregnancy.",
                "Provide her with mindfulness exercises and encourage more social outings.",
                "Express empathy, validate her feelings, and strongly recommend a referral to a perinatal mental health specialist."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Sarah's symptoms strongly suggest a potential perinatal mood and anxiety disorder (PMAD). While mindfulness can be a helpful coping strategy, it is crucial for a wellness coach to recognize the limits of their scope of practice and the urgent need for professional mental health evaluation and support. The most appropriate initial action is to express empathy, validate her experience, and facilitate an immediate referral to a qualified perinatal mental health specialist."

            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis involving over 15,000 pregnant individuals highlighted a significant correlation between chronic sleep deprivation (defined as <6 hours/night) in the third trimester and an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Which of the following is most consistently associated with chronic poor sleep in this population according to such research?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of macrosomia.",
                "Higher incidence of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.",
                "Reduced likelihood of epidural use during labor.",
                "Earlier onset of lactation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently links chronic sleep deprivation during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, to increased risks of conditions such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. This is due to the impact of poor sleep on glucose metabolism, inflammation, and blood pressure regulation. While macrosomia can be related to uncontrolled GD, it's not directly caused by sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is not associated with reduced epidural use or earlier onset of lactation."

            "question": "During a coaching session, a client expresses anxiety about potential medical interventions during labor and delivery. She asks how she can ensure her preferences are respected. What is a key principle of <span class=\"highlight\">informed consent</span> that the coach should explain to empower her?",
            "options": [
                "Informed consent means the medical team will always follow her birth plan exactly as written.",
                "Informed consent requires her to agree to all suggested interventions without question.",
                "Informed consent ensures she receives clear information about proposed interventions, including risks, benefits, alternatives, and the right to refuse, before making a decision.",
                "Informed consent is only necessary for surgical procedures, not for routine labor interventions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is a fundamental ethical and legal principle in healthcare. It ensures that a client receives comprehensive information about any proposed medical intervention, including its purpose, potential risks, anticipated benefits, available alternatives, and the right to refuse treatment. This empowers the client to make autonomous decisions about her care, though it does not guarantee that every aspect of a birth plan will be followed verbatim, as medical circumstances can change."

            "question": "A client 8 weeks postpartum is concerned about a persistent gap in her abdominal muscles. She asks her coach about <span class=\"highlight\">diastasis recti</span>. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding its management?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity abdominal crunches are the most effective way to close the gap quickly.",
                "Diastasis recti always requires surgical repair, regardless of severity.",
                "Specific core strengthening exercises, focusing on deep core muscles and proper breathing, are often recommended, alongside avoiding movements that strain the abdominal wall.",
                "It is a purely cosmetic issue with no functional implications."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Most cases of diastasis recti can be significantly improved with targeted core strengthening exercises that focus on engaging the deep core muscles, such as the transverse abdominis, and incorporating proper breathing techniques. It is crucial to avoid exercises that strain the abdominal wall (e.g., traditional crunches, planks with bulging) initially. While severe cases may require surgical intervention, it is not always necessary, and diastasis recti can have functional implications beyond cosmetics, affecting core stability and pelvic floor health."

            "question": "A client is considering using aromatherapy with essential oils during her pregnancy to manage nausea and anxiety. As her prenatal wellness coach, what is the most important guidance to provide regarding this complementary therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Essential oils are completely natural and therefore safe to use without any precautions during pregnancy.",
                "Advise her to ingest essential oils directly for maximum therapeutic effect.",
                "Emphasize the importance of consulting with a qualified aromatherapist and her healthcare provider, as some oils are contraindicated in pregnancy and proper dilution is essential.",
                "Encourage her to self-diagnose and experiment with various oils she finds online."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While certain essential oils can be beneficial for managing pregnancy symptoms, many are contraindicated or require specific, careful dilution during pregnancy. It is critically important to consult with a qualified aromatherapist who understands prenatal safety and to gain approval from her healthcare provider before using any essential oils. Ingesting essential oils is generally not recommended, especially during pregnancy, and self-diagnosing and experimenting can be dangerous."

            "question": "During a coaching session, a client asks her wellness coach for a specific diagnosis for her persistent fatigue and recommends a prescription medication she heard about. How should the coach respond, adhering to professional boundaries and scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a diagnosis based on the client's symptoms and suggest the medication.",
                "Explain that as a wellness coach, providing medical diagnoses or prescribing medication is outside their scope of practice, and recommend consulting with her healthcare provider.",
                "Refer her to another wellness coach who specializes in fatigue and medication.",
                "Advise her to self-diagnose using reliable online medical resources."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wellness coaches operate within a specific scope of practice that explicitly excludes medical diagnosis, prescription of medication, or treatment of medical conditions. The ethical and professional response is to clearly communicate these boundaries, explain that such actions are outside the coach's scope, and strongly recommend that the client consult with a qualified healthcare provider for evaluation and appropriate medical advice."

            "question": "Maria, a client who is exclusively breastfeeding her 3-month-old, reports feeling constantly depleted and worries about her milk supply. Which advanced nutritional strategy is paramount for her postpartum wellness plan?",
            "options": [
                "Restricting caloric intake to accelerate postpartum weight loss.",
                "Prioritizing nutrient-dense foods, adequate hydration, and sufficient caloric intake (approximately 450-500 additional calories/day for breastfeeding).",
                "Eliminating all dairy and gluten from her diet as a first step.",
                "Relying heavily on caffeine to manage fatigue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exclusive breastfeeding places significant energy and nutrient demands on the mother. To support milk production and maternal energy levels, it is paramount to prioritize a diet rich in nutrient-dense foods, ensure adequate hydration, and consume sufficient caloric intake, typically requiring an additional 450-500 calories per day. Restricting calories, eliminating major food groups without medical indication, or relying heavily on caffeine can negatively impact maternal health and milk supply."

            "question": "A client confides in her coach that she is experiencing intrusive thoughts about harming her baby, although she emphasizes she would never act on them and is terrified by them. She also reports severe anxiety and panic attacks. What is the coach's ethical and professional responsibility in this situation?",
            "options": [
                "Reassure her that these thoughts are normal and will pass.",
                "Encourage her to journal about these thoughts to process them.",
                "Immediately facilitate a warm handoff or urgent referral to a mental health professional specializing in perinatal OCD or psychosis, and potentially advise contacting an emergency service if there is any perceived imminent risk.",
                "Focus on relaxation techniques to help her manage the anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intrusive thoughts of harm, especially when accompanied by severe anxiety, panic attacks, or distress, are significant red flags for serious perinatal mental health conditions such as Perinatal Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or even postpartum psychosis. These conditions require urgent professional mental health intervention. A coach's ethical and professional responsibility is to recognize the severity, avoid attempting to 'coach through' the crisis, and immediately facilitate a warm handoff or urgent referral to a mental health professional specializing in perinatal mental health, while also assessing for any imminent risk that might necessitate emergency services."
