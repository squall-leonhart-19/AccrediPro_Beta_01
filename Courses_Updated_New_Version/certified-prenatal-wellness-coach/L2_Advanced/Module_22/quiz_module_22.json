            "question": "What is the primary purpose of establishing and adhering to an ethical code in prenatal coaching?",
            "options": [
                "To standardize coaching fees across the industry and ensure competitive pricing.",
                "To provide a legal shield for coaches against all potential liabilities and lawsuits.",
                "To guide professional conduct, protect client well-being, and maintain public trust in the profession.",
                "To dictate specific client outcomes and guarantee a particular birth experience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary purpose of an ethical code is to guide professional conduct, protect the well-being of clients, and foster trust in the coaching profession. It sets standards for responsible practice, ensuring coaches operate with integrity and prioritize client safety and autonomy."

            "question": "A client asks their prenatal coach for specific medical advice regarding persistent severe lower back pain and potential interventions. What is the most ethical and appropriate response for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Provide general advice based on common remedies for back pain during pregnancy.",
                "Suggest they research their symptoms online to find solutions.",
                "Refer the client immediately to a qualified healthcare provider (e.g., obstetrician, chiropractor, physical therapist) for diagnosis and treatment.",
                "Offer to share personal experiences or those of other clients who had similar pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prenatal coaches operate within a defined scope of practice. Providing medical advice is outside this scope. The ethical responsibility is to recognize boundaries and refer clients to qualified healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, ensuring client safety and appropriate care through interdisciplinary collaboration."

            "question": "Which of the following is NOT an essential component of obtaining valid informed consent from a prenatal coaching client?",
            "options": [
                "Disclosure of the nature of services, potential benefits, risks, and alternative options.",
                "The client's demonstrated capacity to understand the information and make autonomous decisions.",
                "A guarantee of achieving specific positive outcomes, such as a 'perfect' birth or immediate relief from discomfort.",
                "Voluntary agreement by the client, free from coercion or undue influence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires disclosure, client capacity, and voluntariness. A guarantee of specific outcomes is unrealistic and unethical, as coaching facilitates client-led journeys and cannot predict or control all variables or promise specific results."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "Under what circumstance is a prenatal coach ethically and legally obligated to breach client confidentiality?",
            "options": [
                "When a client shares a minor, non-urgent concern about their partner's habits.",
                "When a colleague requests insights into a shared client's progress to better coordinate care.",
                "When there is a court order (subpoena) or a clear and imminent danger to the client or identifiable others.",
                "When the client provides positive feedback about the coach on social media, allowing the coach to share details of their success story."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality is a cornerstone of ethical practice. However, legal mandates (like a court subpoena) or situations involving clear and imminent danger to the client or others are recognized exceptions where confidentiality must be breached to ensure safety and comply with the law. All other options would be a breach of confidentiality."

            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "A client, delighted with their coaching experience, offers their prenatal coach an expensive, personalized gift (e.g., a high-end stroller). What is the most appropriate ethical response to maintain professional boundaries?",
            "options": [
                "Graciously accept the gift to avoid offending the client and acknowledge their appreciation.",
                "Accept the gift, but immediately donate it to a local charity without informing the client.",
                "Politely decline the gift, explaining the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and the therapeutic nature of the coaching relationship.",
                "Accept the gift only if its monetary value is below a certain threshold (e.g., $50) as defined by a personal policy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Accepting expensive gifts can blur professional boundaries, create a sense of obligation, or introduce dual relationships. Ethically, a coach should politely decline such gifts, reinforcing the professional nature of their relationship and the value of their services, preventing potential conflicts of interest."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "A prenatal coach consistently takes on more clients than they can effectively manage, neglects their own self-care, and stops engaging in continued professional development. This behavior primarily risks compromising which ethical principle?",
            "options": [
                "Client autonomy, as the client might feel pressured.",
                "Confidentiality, as the coach might accidentally share information.",
                "Coach competence and the quality of service delivery due to burnout and outdated knowledge.",
                "Interdisciplinary collaboration, as the coach is too busy to network."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Overwhelm, lack of self-care, and neglecting continued professional development directly impair a coach's ability to maintain competence and provide high-quality, ethical services. Burnout can lead to reduced effectiveness, impaired judgment, and potential harm to clients, directly impacting the principle of beneficence."

            "question": "When faced with an ethical dilemma where two or more ethical principles seem to conflict (e.g., client autonomy versus beneficence), what is the recommended approach for a prenatal coach?",
            "options": [
                "Make a quick decision based on personal intuition or convenience.",
                "Prioritize the option that will generate the most positive feedback or referrals.",
                "Utilize a structured ethical decision-making model (e.g., the AccrediPro Ethical Decision-Making Model) to systematically analyze the situation, consider stakeholders, and weigh potential outcomes.",
                "Consult only with a close friend or family member for advice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Structured ethical decision-making models provide a systematic framework to navigate complex dilemmas. They encourage coaches to gather information, identify ethical principles at play, consider alternative actions, evaluate consequences, and choose the most justifiable course of action, rather than relying on intuition or personal bias."

                "\"Guaranteed pain-free birth and instant recovery with our exclusive coaching program!\"",
                "\"Our program is endorsed by all leading medical associations (without providing specific verification or proof).\"",
                "\"Offering evidence-informed strategies and personalized support to empower your positive prenatal and birth experience.\"",
                "\"Join our program and never experience pregnancy discomforts again!\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing is truthful, transparent, and avoids exaggerated claims or guarantees that cannot be substantiated. It focuses on providing accurate information about services and their potential benefits, emphasizing support and empowerment rather than unrealistic promises or unverified endorsements."

            "question": "A client expresses a strong desire for a home birth, which, while within the realm of safe options for low-risk pregnancies, is viewed with caution by their family and some healthcare providers. The client is well-informed about the risks and benefits and has chosen a qualified midwife. Ethically, how should the prenatal coach support this client?",
            "options": [
                "Strongly advise the client to reconsider and opt for a hospital birth to avoid family conflict.",
                "Support the client's informed, autonomous decision by providing resources, addressing anxieties, and coaching them through communication with family and providers, without imposing personal biases.",
                "Refuse to coach the client further, as their decision might be seen as controversial by others.",
                "Focus only on the potential risks of home birth to ensure the client is fully aware."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical coaching prioritizes client autonomy. If a client makes an informed decision within the bounds of safety and legal practice, the coach's role is to support that decision, provide relevant resources, and help the client navigate their journey, rather than imposing personal views or external pressures. This demonstrates respect for their right to self-determination."

            "question": "During a virtual group coaching session, one participant (Client A) starts discussing highly sensitive personal details about another participant (Client B) whom they know from a separate social group, without Client B's consent. What is the coach's immediate ethical responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Allow Client A to continue, as it might encourage open sharing within the group.",
                "Immediately interrupt Client A, politely but firmly remind the group of the confidentiality agreement, and redirect the conversation, then follow up privately with Client A if necessary.",
                "Publicly reprimand Client A for breaching privacy and remove them from the session.",
                "Ignore the comment, hoping it will pass unnoticed and not cause further issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The coach has an immediate ethical responsibility to protect the privacy and confidentiality of all clients, especially in a group setting. This requires prompt intervention to stop the breach, reinforce confidentiality expectations, and address the situation professionally, potentially with a private follow-up to Client A to reinforce boundaries."
