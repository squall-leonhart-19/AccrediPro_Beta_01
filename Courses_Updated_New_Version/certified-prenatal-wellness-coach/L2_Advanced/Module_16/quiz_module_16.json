            "question": "A prenatal client confides in her coach about experiencing severe domestic violence, expressing fear for her safety and that of her unborn child, but explicitly asks the coach not to report it due to fear of reprisal. According to advanced ethical practice in prenatal coaching (L1), what is the most appropriate immediate action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Respect the client's autonomy and maintain strict confidentiality as requested.",
                "Immediately report the situation to child protective services and local law enforcement without informing the client.",
                "Discuss the limits of confidentiality with the client, explain the duty to protect, and collaboratively explore safety planning and referral options to support services.",
                "Advise the client to leave her partner immediately and offer to help her find a new living situation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In situations involving a clear and present danger to the client or unborn child, the ethical principle of duty to protect overrides strict confidentiality. The coach must discuss the limits of confidentiality, explain the legal and ethical obligations, and work collaboratively with the client to develop a safety plan and facilitate referrals to appropriate support services, such as domestic violence shelters or legal aid. Unilaterally reporting without discussion can erode trust, while simply respecting confidentiality would be irresponsible given the risk. Directly advising the client to leave may not be safe or practical for her."

            "question": "A client in her third trimester carrying monochorionic-diamniotic twins develops symptoms consistent with Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS). What is the primary characteristic of TTTS that necessitates immediate and specialized medical intervention (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "Discrepancy in fetal growth where one twin is significantly larger than the other due to genetic factors.",
                "An imbalance in blood flow through shared placental vessels, leading to one twin receiving too much blood (recipient) and the other too little (donor).",
                "Premature rupture of membranes occurring in one amniotic sac but not the other.",
                "The presence of a single, shared amniotic sac leading to entanglement risks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) is a severe complication unique to monochorionic pregnancies (those sharing a placenta). It arises from an imbalance in blood flow through shared vascular connections in the placenta, causing one twin (the donor) to become anemic and growth-restricted with low amniotic fluid, while the other (the recipient) develops polycythemia, fluid overload, and polyhydramnios. This requires immediate specialized medical intervention, often including fetoscopic laser surgery, to correct the blood flow imbalance and improve outcomes."

            "question": "A prenatal client exhibits persistent low mood, anhedonia, significant changes in sleep and appetite, and expresses feelings of worthlessness for over two weeks. She mentions difficulty bonding with her pregnancy. Which mental health condition is most indicated (L3), and what is the coach's primary role?",
            "options": [
                "Normal pregnancy mood swings; provide reassurance and encourage rest.",
                "Perinatal Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (POCD); focus on cognitive restructuring techniques.",
                "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the perinatal period; facilitate immediate referral to a qualified mental health professional for assessment and treatment.",
                "Generalized Anxiety Disorder; suggest relaxation techniques and mindfulness exercises."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described (persistent low mood, anhedonia, sleep/appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty bonding) are classic indicators of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the perinatal period. While coaches can provide support, their primary role when severe mental health concerns are suspected is to facilitate an immediate and appropriate referral to a qualified mental health professional (e.g., psychiatrist, therapist specializing in perinatal mental health) for comprehensive assessment and treatment. These symptoms are beyond normal pregnancy mood swings and require professional intervention."

            "question": "A client is diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) at 28 weeks. Beyond dietary modifications and regular exercise, what is a critical coaching focus regarding ongoing management and potential complications (L2)?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging immediate induction of labor to prevent fetal macrosomia.",
                "Emphasizing strict adherence to blood glucose monitoring and understanding the implications of hyperglycemia for both maternal and fetal health (e.g., macrosomia, preeclampsia risk).",
                "Advising complete avoidance of all carbohydrates to stabilize blood sugar levels.",
                "Recommending a high-intensity exercise regimen to burn excess glucose."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For a client with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), strict adherence to blood glucose monitoring is paramount to ensure blood sugar levels remain within target ranges. The coach's role is to educate the client about the importance of this monitoring and the potential risks of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, such as fetal macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and increased maternal risk of preeclampsia and type 2 diabetes later in life. While diet and exercise are key, they must be guided by medical professionals and supported by consistent monitoring. Extreme carbohydrate restriction or high-intensity exercise without medical clearance are not appropriate recommendations."

            "question": "A coach is working with a client from a cultural background where discussing pregnancy complications is considered taboo, and traditional remedies are highly valued over Western medicine. The client is experiencing symptoms that warrant medical attention. How should the coach best navigate this situation (L5)?",
            "options": [
                "Insist the client abandon traditional practices and immediately consult a Western medical doctor.",
                "Respect the client's beliefs and avoid discussing medical concerns altogether.",
                "Educate the client about potential risks in a culturally sensitive manner, seek to understand her beliefs, and explore how traditional practices can complement, rather than replace, necessary medical care.",
                "Refer the client to a different coach who shares her cultural background."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective prenatal coaching in diverse contexts requires cultural competence. The coach should approach the situation with sensitivity, acknowledging and respecting the client's cultural beliefs and practices. The best approach is to educate the client about potential health risks in a non-judgmental way, listen to her perspectives on traditional remedies, and explore how these might be integrated or complement necessary Western medical care. The goal is to ensure the client receives appropriate care while honoring her cultural values, rather than dismissing them or imposing a different cultural norm."

            "question": "When a prenatal coach identifies a client who requires specialized nutritional guidance due to a complex autoimmune condition affecting nutrient absorption, what is the most effective approach for interdisciplinary collaboration (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "Provide general dietary advice based on common prenatal guidelines.",
                "Take on the role of a nutritionist and develop a specific meal plan for the client.",
                "Facilitate a referral to a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) specializing in prenatal nutrition and autoimmune conditions, ensuring clear communication with the RDN and the client's medical team.",
                "Advise the client to search online for suitable dietary recommendations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For complex nutritional needs arising from conditions like autoimmune disease affecting nutrient absorption, a prenatal coach's scope of practice does not extend to providing specialized dietary prescriptions. The most effective and ethical approach is to facilitate a referral to a qualified Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) who has expertise in prenatal nutrition and managing autoimmune conditions. Crucially, the coach should ensure clear, collaborative communication with the RDN and the client's entire medical team to ensure integrated and consistent care."

            "question": "During a coaching session, a client expresses passive suicidal ideation, stating, 'Sometimes I just wish I wouldn't wake up.' She denies active plans but seems overwhelmed. What is the coach's most critical immediate action (L7)?",
            "options": [
                "Reassure the client that these feelings are normal during pregnancy and recommend journaling.",
                "Immediately contact emergency services (e.g., 911/crisis line) without further discussion with the client.",
                "Engage in a direct, compassionate conversation to assess the severity of risk, ensure the client's immediate safety, and facilitate an urgent referral to a crisis mental health professional or emergency services if active risk is identified.",
                "Schedule an extra session for the following day to delve deeper into her feelings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Any expression of suicidal ideation, even passive, must be taken seriously. The coach's most critical immediate action is to engage in a direct, compassionate conversation to assess the level of risk (e.g., presence of a plan, intent, access to means). The coach must prioritize the client's immediate safety and, based on the assessment, facilitate an urgent referral to a crisis mental health professional or emergency services if active risk is identified. Dismissing the feelings or delaying intervention is inappropriate. Contacting emergency services immediately without further assessment might be premature if the client has no active plan, but it's a necessary step if risk is high."

            "question": "A client presents with a history of preterm labor in a previous pregnancy, current gestational hypertension, and significant anxiety regarding her ability to carry to term. Which advanced case management strategy best synthesizes these complexities (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "Focus solely on managing the gestational hypertension through diet and exercise.",
                "Develop a holistic, individualized care plan that integrates medical monitoring (e.g., MFM specialist collaboration), anxiety management techniques (e.g., referral to perinatal therapist), and education on preterm labor prevention, while regularly reassessing the plan's effectiveness.",
                "Advise the client to avoid all physical activity to reduce the risk of preterm labor.",
                "Reassure the client that past pregnancies do not predict future outcomes and dismiss her anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesizing advanced case management requires a holistic and individualized approach. This client has interconnected physiological (preterm labor history, gestational hypertension) and psychological (anxiety) challenges. The optimal strategy involves comprehensive collaboration with her medical team (especially a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist for high-risk conditions), referral to a perinatal mental health therapist for anxiety, and providing coaching on stress management, sleep hygiene, and evidence-based strategies for preterm labor prevention and managing hypertension. This plan must be dynamic and regularly reassessed, validating the client's fears while empowering her with tools and support."

            "question": "In the context of advanced case study methodology (L1), what is the primary purpose of conducting a <span class=\"highlight\">root cause analysis</span> for a client's complex challenges (e.g., chronic stress impacting pregnancy outcomes)?",
            "options": [
                "To assign blame for the client's current difficulties.",
                "To quickly implement a standard, generalized intervention plan.",
                "To identify the fundamental underlying factors contributing to the client's presenting issues, enabling the development of targeted, effective, and sustainable interventions.",
                "To categorize the client into a predefined risk group for administrative purposes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A root cause analysis in advanced case study methodology aims to move beyond superficial symptoms to uncover the fundamental, underlying factors that contribute to a client's complex challenges. By identifying these deep-seated causes (e.g., chronic psychosocial stress, unaddressed trauma, systemic barriers), coaches can develop truly targeted, effective, and sustainable intervention strategies that address the core problem, rather than just managing symptoms. It is not about assigning blame or fitting clients into generic categories."

            "question": "A 38-year-old client with a history of severe preeclampsia in her first pregnancy is now pregnant with twins and expresses overwhelming fear of recurrence and potential complications, leading to poor sleep and nutrition. Which integrated coaching approach is most appropriate (L2, L3, L4)?",
            "options": [
                "Focus exclusively on nutritional counseling to improve sleep and mitigate preeclampsia risk.",
                "Encourage her to research preeclampsia extensively online to feel more informed.",
                "Collaborate with her medical team (MFM specialist for preeclampsia risk), refer to a perinatal mental health therapist for anxiety, and provide coaching on stress management, sleep hygiene, and balanced nutrition, all while validating her fears.",
                "Advise her to simply relax more and trust her doctors, avoiding discussion of her fears."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This client presents with a complex interplay of high-risk physiological factors (age, twin pregnancy, history of severe preeclampsia) and significant mental health challenges (overwhelming fear, poor sleep, nutrition impact). An integrated coaching approach is essential. This involves: 1) Medical collaboration: ensuring she is receiving specialized care from an MFM for her high-risk pregnancy; 2) Mental health support: referral to a perinatal mental health therapist to address her anxiety and fear; and 3) Coaching support: providing practical strategies for stress management, sleep hygiene, and balanced nutrition, all while actively listening and validating her emotional experience. This holistic approach addresses all facets of her well-being."
