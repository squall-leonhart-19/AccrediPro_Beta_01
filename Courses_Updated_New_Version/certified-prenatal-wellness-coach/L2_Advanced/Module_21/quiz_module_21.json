            "options": [
                "Focusing solely on the physical health of the mother and fetus.",
                "Integrating physical, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being for a comprehensive approach.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "During an advanced needs assessment, a coach identifies a client, Sarah, who expresses significant anxiety about childbirth, financial stressors, and limited social support. This comprehensive assessment approach, considering interconnected biological, psychological, and social factors, is primarily informed by which model?",
            "options": [
                "The purely medical model, focusing only on physiological risk factors.",
                "The behavioral model, emphasizing only habit formation and modification.",
                "The biopsychosocial model, recognizing the interplay of various factors on health outcomes.",
                "The reductionist model, isolating individual symptoms for treatment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The biopsychosocial model is central to advanced needs assessment, as it considers the intricate connections between biological (e.g., physical health), psychological (e.g., anxiety, coping mechanisms), and social (e.g., support systems, financial status) factors that influence a client's overall well-being during pregnancy."

            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach is developing a nutritional plan for a client in her second trimester. Based on current evidence-based guidelines, which micronutrient is crucial for fetal neural tube development (especially in early pregnancy) and red blood cell formation, and often requires supplementation due to the difficulty of meeting needs through diet alone?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D",
                "Calcium",
                "Iron",
                "Folate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Folate (folic acid) is critically important for preventing neural tube defects and supporting red blood cell production during pregnancy. While other nutrients are vital, folate's role in early fetal development and the common challenge of adequate dietary intake make supplementation a key recommendation."

                "150 minutes per week, spread across at least 3-5 days.",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) 3 times per week, regardless of prior fitness level.",
                "Avoiding all weight-bearing exercises after the first trimester to prevent injury."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ACOG recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week for healthy pregnant women without contraindications, typically spread across several days. This promotes cardiovascular health and manages weight without excessive strain."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A client, Maria, reports elevated stress levels impacting her sleep and overall well-being. Which stress management technique would a prenatal wellness coach most likely recommend for immediate, self-guided implementation, known for its physiological calming effects?",
            "options": [
                "Referring her immediately for intensive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).",
                "Daily practice of progressive muscle relaxation or diaphragmatic breathing exercises.",
                "Advising her to eliminate all physical activity to conserve energy and reduce stress.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Techniques like progressive muscle relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing can be taught and practiced immediately by clients, offering direct physiological benefits for stress reduction and promoting relaxation, which can improve sleep. While CBT may be beneficial, it's not an immediate, self-guided technique."

            "question": "In the third trimester, many pregnant clients experience increased nocturnal awakenings due to discomfort, frequent urination, and restless legs. Beyond addressing potential underlying medical issues, what is a practical sleep hygiene strategy a coach might suggest to optimize sleep?",
            "options": [
                "Restricting all fluid intake after midday to reduce nighttime urination.",
                "Engaging in vigorous exercise right before bedtime to induce fatigue.",
                "Using supportive pillows (e.g., pregnancy pillow), maintaining a cool, dark, and quiet sleep environment, and establishing a consistent bedtime routine.",
                "Consuming a heavy, carbohydrate-rich meal immediately before sleep to induce drowsiness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Optimizing the sleep environment (cool, dark, quiet), using supportive pillows for comfort, and establishing a consistent bedtime routine are highly effective sleep hygiene strategies for pregnant clients. Restricting fluids excessively or engaging in vigorous activity before bed can be counterproductive."

                "\"I will try to drink water when I remember throughout the day.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A measurable goal includes specific quantities or metrics that allow for tracking progress. '8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters) of water daily' provides a clear, quantifiable target, unlike vague statements like 'more water' or 'when I remember'."

                "It primarily reduces the coach's workload in creating the plan.",
                "It ensures the plan is exclusively based on the coach's theoretical expertise.",
                "It fosters client ownership, enhances adherence, and ensures the plan aligns with the client's unique values, preferences, and lifestyle.",
                "It mainly serves as a legal requirement for documenting client consent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Client collaboration and autonomy are paramount because they foster a sense of ownership over the plan, significantly increasing adherence and sustainability. When clients feel heard and actively participate in shaping their plan, it becomes a reflection of their personal goals and feasible within their lifestyle."

                "Immediately discontinuing all current interventions and starting a completely new plan.",
                "Reassessing the client's current symptoms, lifestyle factors, and potentially collaborating with their healthcare provider for medical evaluation.",
                "Instructing the client to 'try harder' to follow the existing plan more strictly.",
                "Assuming the current plan is a complete failure and ending the coaching relationship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Persistent symptoms warrant a careful reassessment of the client's situation, considering all potential factors. It's crucial for the coach to recognize the limits of their scope and collaborate with the client's healthcare provider to rule out or address any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to the symptoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lower back pain often benefits from appropriate movement and strengthening, while leg cramps can frequently be alleviated by ensuring adequate hydration and electrolyte balance (magnesium, potassium). A holistic approach integrates these physical and nutritional strategies for optimal relief."
