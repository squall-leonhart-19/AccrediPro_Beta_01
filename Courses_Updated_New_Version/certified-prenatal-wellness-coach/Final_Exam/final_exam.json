            "options": [
                "To conduct a comprehensive initial assessment, identifying current wellness practices and potential limiting beliefs.",
                "To immediately implement a personalized nutrition and exercise plan based on general prenatal guidelines.",
                "To focus exclusively on developing a positive mindset for birth, deferring physical assessments.",
                "To establish a detailed postpartum recovery plan, including newborn care strategies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Baseline & Beliefs' phase (B) is foundational. Its primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive initial assessment encompassing physical, emotional, and mental well-being, while also identifying current wellness practices and any limiting beliefs or fears surrounding pregnancy and birth. This information forms the basis for all subsequent coaching interventions, as outlined in Module 1: Build Foundations."

            "options": [
                "Vitamin D",
                "Iron",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Folate (or its synthetic form, folic acid) is crucial for early fetal development, particularly for the neural tube. Supplementation of 400-800 mcg daily, starting at least one month pre-conception and continuing through the first trimester, is strongly recommended by organizations like the CDC and ACOG to significantly reduce the risk of neural tube defects. This aligns with the 'Lifestyle & Learning' (L) component of the B.L.O.O.M. Framework™, specifically Module 2."

Framework™, which advanced technique is most appropriate to help cultivate emotional resilience and address this specific fear?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing an anxiolytic medication.",
                "Referring the client to a physical therapist for pain management.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Optimize & Overcome' phase focuses on cultivating a positive mindset, emotional resilience, and effective coping strategies. For significant anxiety about labor, guiding the client through mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) techniques, visualization, and cognitive reframing are highly effective, evidence-based coaching interventions. Prescribing medication is outside a coach's scope, and avoiding information is not an empowering strategy. This application aligns with Module 3 and advanced techniques discussed in Module 23."

What is the MOST appropriate ethical action for a Certified Prenatal Wellness Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Provide immediate counseling and therapy sessions to address the depression.",
                "Advise the client to 'think positive' and focus on the joy of impending motherhood.",
                "Recommend a specific antidepressant medication based on anecdotal experience.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While coaches support emotional well-being, diagnosing and treating mental health conditions like perinatal depression falls outside the scope of practice for a prenatal wellness coach. The most ethical and responsible action is to acknowledge the client's distress, provide empathetic support, and facilitate a prompt referral to a licensed mental health professional who can provide appropriate diagnosis and treatment. This is a key principle covered in Module 22: Ethical Considerations."

            "question": "In the 'Lifestyle & Learning' (L) phase of the B.L.O.O.M. Framework™, a coach is educating a client on safe prenatal exercise. Which statement best reflects current recommendations for exercise intensity for most healthy pregnant individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain a heart rate above 160 bpm to ensure cardiovascular benefits.",
                "Avoid all weight-bearing exercises to prevent injury.",
                "Engage in moderate-intensity activity, where the client can still hold a conversation ('talk test').",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current guidelines from organizations like ACOG recommend that healthy pregnant individuals engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Moderate intensity is often gauged by the 'talk test,' where the individual can converse comfortably but cannot sing. Heart rate targets are less emphasized due to individual variability. Module 2: Lifestyle & Learning covers these guidelines."

As a prenatal wellness coach, what is the MOST effective evidence-based strategy you would recommend to improve her sleep, aligning with the 'Lifestyle & Learning' (L) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest she takes over-the-counter sleep aids nightly.",
                "Advise limiting fluid intake entirely, especially in the evening.",
                "Recommend establishing a consistent bedtime routine, optimizing sleep environment, and practicing relaxation techniques before bed.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing good sleep hygiene practices, such as a consistent bedtime routine, optimizing the sleep environment (dark, quiet, cool), and incorporating relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, gentle stretching) before bed, are evidence-based strategies to improve sleep quality in pregnancy. While reducing evening fluids can help with urination, complete restriction is not advisable. OTC sleep aids should only be used under medical guidance. This aligns with Module 2: Lifestyle & Learning."

            "options": [
                "Immediately begin marketing the program to generate interest.",
                "Design the program curriculum based solely on personal experiences as a parent.",
                "Conduct a needs assessment of the target audience and integrate evidence-based practices.",
                "Focus exclusively on advanced fitness routines, assuming all participants are equally capable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A crucial initial step in program development is to conduct a thorough needs assessment of the target audience to understand their specific challenges, goals, and preferences. Concurrently, the program curriculum must be built upon evidence-based practices and guidelines to ensure efficacy and safety. This systematic approach is vital for creating impactful and ethical group programs, as detailed in Module 26."

            "options": [
                "Provide a detailed meal plan and exercise prescription tailored to gestational diabetes.",
                "Advise the client on specific medication dosages for blood sugar control.",

                "Suggest a restrictive diet found online that claims to 'cure' gestational diabetes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A prenatal wellness coach's scope of practice does not include diagnosing or treating medical conditions, or providing specific medical advice. For conditions like gestational diabetes, the coach should reinforce general healthy lifestyle principles, emphasize adherence to the client's medical team's advice, and facilitate referrals to qualified healthcare professionals (e.g., registered dietitian, endocrinologist) for specialized management. This is a core ethical principle covered in Module 0 and Module 33."

            "question": "In the 'Outlook & Outcomes' (O) phase of the B.L.O.O.M. Framework™, a coach is helping a client prepare for postpartum recovery. Which aspect is central to developing a clear vision and proactive plan for this transition?",
            "options": [
                "Solely focusing on the baby's needs and ignoring the mother's recovery.",
                "Establishing unrealistic expectations for immediate return to pre-pregnancy body and activities.",
                "Developing a 'fourth trimester' plan that addresses physical healing, emotional support, practical help, and self-care strategies.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Outlook & Outcomes' phase involves developing a clear vision for a positive birth experience and a healthy postpartum recovery. This includes proactive planning for the 'fourth trimester,' encompassing physical healing (e.g., rest, nutrition), emotional support (e.g., mental health check-ins), practical help (e.g., meal trains, household support), and dedicated self-care strategies. Realistic expectations are key, not unrealistic ones. This is covered in Module 4."

            "options": [
                "To diagnose mental health disorders.",
                "To provide a comprehensive medical evaluation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced assessment tools, including psychosocial screenings, are used by prenatal wellness coaches not for diagnosis or medical evaluation, but to identify potential areas of concern (e.g., high stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms) that may impact a client's well-being. This identification then guides the coach in tailoring support, offering appropriate coaching strategies, or facilitating referrals to licensed professionals when necessary. This aligns with Module 20: Assessment Tools."

                "Dismissing her feelings as 'normal pregnancy hormones'.",
                "Encouraging her to compare herself to other seemingly 'perfect' mothers.",

            "explanation": "Cultivating a positive mindset and emotional resilience (Module 3: Optimize & Overcome) involves empowering the client to recognize their own capabilities. Strategies include helping them identify personal strengths, challenging and reframing negative self-talk, and fostering self-compassion. Dismissing feelings or encouraging comparisons are counterproductive and harmful."

            "explanation": "In complex scenarios involving a history of trauma, a prenatal wellness coach's primary responsibility is to ensure the client's safety and well-being within their scope. Heightened anxiety and dissociation indicate that the client may require specialized support beyond coaching. The most appropriate initial action is to refer the client to a trauma-informed therapist or mental health professional who can provide the necessary clinical intervention, while maintaining supportive coaching within safe boundaries. This aligns with Module 17: Complex Client Scenarios."

It involves integrating sustainable wellness habits, empowering the client with self-advocacy skills, and supporting them in embracing their evolving identity as a mother with confidence and self-compassion. It emphasizes mastery over their ongoing wellness journey, not just a return to a previous state or the end of support. This is the culmination of the B.L.O.O.M. Framework™, as described in Module 5."
