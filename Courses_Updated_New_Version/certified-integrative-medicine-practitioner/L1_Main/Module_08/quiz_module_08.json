            "question": "In the context of mitochondrial bioenergetics, what characterizes the 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR) Phase 1?",
            "options": [
                "A shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis to prioritize cellular defense",
                "Increased ATP production to fuel rapid tissue repair",
                "The upregulation of antioxidant enzymes to neutralize reactive oxygen species",
                "The transition of mitochondria into a 'pro-resolution' state to end inflammation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 of the Cell Danger Response (CDR) involves a metabolic shift where mitochondria stop producing ATP via oxidative phosphorylation and move toward glycolysis (the Warburg Effect) to provide the building blocks for cellular defense."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "Which clinical marker is considered the most sensitive early indicator of metabolic dysfunction, often elevating years before fasting blood glucose rises?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) measures fasting insulin levels against glucose. Because the body will overproduce insulin to keep glucose normal, high insulin is an earlier warning sign than high glucose."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting inactive T4 into active T3, often resulting in increased levels of inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Human metabolism follows a circadian rhythm where insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food (TEF) are highest in the morning and early afternoon, making early windows more metabolically efficient."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and BPA are well-documented endocrine disruptors that act as obesogens by interfering with hormonal signaling and activating PPAR-gamma, which triggers adipogenesis (fat cell creation)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sympathetic dominance triggers the release of catecholamines and cortisol, which signal the liver to release stored glucose (gluconeogenesis/glycogenolysis), leading to elevated blood sugar even in the absence of food."
