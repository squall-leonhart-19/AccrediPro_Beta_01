            "question": "In the transition from 'Intervention' to 'Optimization,' what is the primary shift in the practitioner's clinical focus?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from symptom suppression to restoring physiological baseline",
                "Shifting from the resolution of pathology to the enhancement of physiological reserve and performance",
                "Transitioning from high-dose supplementation to pharmaceutical maintenance",
                "Decreasing the frequency of client contact to increase practitioner revenue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intervention focuses on returning a client to a functional baseline, whereas Optimization focuses on expanding the client's 'physiological reserve' and performance beyond the absence of disease."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits (e.g., 'I am the type of person who never misses a workout') are more sustainable than outcome-based habits because the behavior becomes part of the person's self-concept."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In winter, shorter days can disrupt the circadian rhythm; prioritizing morning light exposure helps maintain melatonin/cortisol cycles and mood stability."

                "To determine the lowest amount of a supplement that produces a toxic effect",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MED protocol ensures that wellness does not 'break' during life's challenges, maintaining momentum with the least amount of effort required to prevent regression."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE) occurs when a person views a single slip-up as a total failure, leading to the 'might as well keep eating' mentality that causes a full relapse."
