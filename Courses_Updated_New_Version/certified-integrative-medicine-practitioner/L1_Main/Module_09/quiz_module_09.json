            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "In the context of the NEI Super-Axis, which pro-inflammatory cytokine is primarily responsible for inducing 'sickness behavior' by crossing the blood-brain barrier and activating the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-10 (IL-10)",
                "Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)",

                "Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IL-1β is a key signaling molecule in the NEI axis that triggers sickness behavior (lethargy, anhedonia) and directly stimulates the hypothalamus to release CRH, initiating the stress response."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "When assessing HPA axis function beyond the 'adrenal fatigue' myth, which biomarker represents the 'stress-preparedness' reflex and is considered a sensitive indicator of hippocampal health?",

                "Evening Melatonin Levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is a distinct 35-50% rise in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. It reflects the hippocampus's ability to prepare the body for the day's perceived demands."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "The 'Kynurenine Shunt' describes a process where chronic inflammation diverts Tryptophan away from serotonin production. Which neurotoxic metabolite is produced as a result, contributing to neuro-inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Indole-3-propionic acid",
                "5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)",

                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under inflammatory conditions (high IL-6 or IFN-γ), the enzyme IDO diverts tryptophan to the kynurenine pathway, producing Quinolinic Acid, an NMDA receptor agonist that causes excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CDR1 is the 'innate immune' phase where cells stop normal metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation) and switch to glycolysis to stiffen membranes and limit viral/bacterial replication."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is a major signaling molecule in the Gut-Brain axis that strengthens both the intestinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through epigenetic modulation (HDAC inhibition)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During Slow-Wave Sleep, the brain's interstitial space increases by up to 60%, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out neurotoxic waste products via the glymphatic pathway."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (the 'smart' vagus) is unique to mammals and supports social bonding, communication, and the 'vagal brake' that slows the heart rate and promotes calm."

            "question": "A client presents with chronic brain fog, low morning energy, and a history of IBS. Lab results show a 'flat' diurnal cortisol curve and elevated fecal calprotectin. What is the most likely NEI mechanism at play?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of gut inflammation (calprotectin) and HPA dysfunction (flat curve) suggests that peripheral immune signals are driving neuro-inflammation and disrupting the HPA axis's normal rhythm."

            "question": "Research on circadian biology indicates that blue light exposure (460-480nm) after sunset suppresses melatonin production for how long on average?",
            "options": [
                "It has no effect on melatonin once the sun has set",
                "It delays melatonin onset by approximately 15-30 minutes",
                "It can suppress melatonin for up to 90 minutes and shift the circadian phase",
                "It only affects melatonin in children, not adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exposure to blue-enriched light in the evening stimulates melanopsin-containing cells in the retina, signaling the SCN to suppress melatonin and delaying the biological clock."
