            "question": "In the Systems Biology Paradigm, how is a chronic disease state primarily viewed compared to the conventional medical model?",
            "options": [
                "As a collection of isolated symptoms requiring specific pharmaceutical suppression.",
                "As an emergent property of complex, non-linear interactions within biological networks.",
                "As a purely genetic inevitability that cannot be modified by environmental factors.",
                "As a linear progression where one single cause always leads to one single effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systems biology views health and disease as 'emergent properties' resulting from the complex, non-linear interactions across various physiological networks (the 'web'), rather than isolated symptoms."

                "An event that initiates an acute symptomatic flare-up, such as a viral infection.",
                "A biochemical messenger, like a cytokine, that sustains a chronic inflammatory response.",
                "A pre-existing factor, such as genetic predisposition or early-life trauma, that sets the stage for dysfunction.",
                "A lifestyle modification intended to reverse a chronic health condition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Antecedents are 'pre-existing' factors (genetic, environmental, or lifestyle-based) that predispose an individual to certain imbalances before the onset of illness."

            "question": "Why is Gastrointestinal Integrity often referred to as 'The Root of the Root' in clinical synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Because the gut contains 100% of the body's immune cells.",
                "Because intestinal permeability allows undigested proteins and LPS to enter systemic circulation, triggering widespread inflammation.",
                "Because the gut is the only organ capable of biotransforming environmental toxins.",
                "Because digestive enzymes are the primary regulators of the HPA axis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut houses approximately 70-80% of the immune system; a breakdown in the intestinal barrier (leaky gut) leads to metabolic endotoxemia (LPS entry), which drives systemic inflammation and hormonal disruption."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In Phase II Biotransformation, the body adds a functional group (like glutathione or a methyl group) to a toxin. What is the primary purpose of this process?",
            "options": [
                "To make the toxin more lipid-soluble so it can be stored in adipose tissue.",
                "To increase the reactivity of the molecule to create free radicals.",
                "To make the toxin water-soluble for excretion via bile or urine.",
                "To convert the toxin into a usable macronutrient for ATP production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase II conjugation involves attaching molecules to toxins to make them water-soluble, allowing the body to safely excrete them."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The HPA axis regulates the stress response and cortisol rhythms; dysregulation often manifests as abnormal cortisol patterns (e.g., high night cortisol or low morning cortisol)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an energy deficit (low ATP) and high oxidative stress (ROS leakage), which damages cellular DNA and membranes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In clinical synthesis, GI integrity is prioritized because a 'leaky gut' acts as a constant source of inflammation (mediators) that can undermine hormonal and mitochondrial interventions."
