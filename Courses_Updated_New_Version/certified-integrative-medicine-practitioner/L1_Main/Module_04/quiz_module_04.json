            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), the body's master biological clock, is primarily regulated by which specific wavelength of light via the melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells?",
            "options": [
                "Red light (620-750 nm)",
                "Green light (495-570 nm)",

                "Infrared light (780 nm - 1 mm)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SCN is most sensitive to short-wavelength blue light (460-480 nm), which suppresses melatonin production and signals 'daytime' to the brain's master clock."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Human physiology is circadian-optimized for nutrient processing in the morning; insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food are significantly higher earlier in the day compared to the evening."
