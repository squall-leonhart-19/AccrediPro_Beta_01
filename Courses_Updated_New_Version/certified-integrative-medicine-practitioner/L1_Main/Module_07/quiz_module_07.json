            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "The 'Unified Theory' of the Neuro-Endocrine-Immunology (NEI) axis suggests that these systems are not distinct, but rather communicate through a shared language of:",
            "options": [
                "Only electrical impulses and synaptic junctions",
                "Ligands and receptors including cytokines, hormones, and neurotransmitters",
                "Strictly genomic modifications within the cell nucleus",
                "Exclusively through the lymphatic drainage system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NEI supersystem communicates bidirectionally using a shared 'biochemical language' where immune cells produce hormones, endocrine glands respond to cytokines, and neurons possess receptors for both."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, the term 'Adrenal Fatigue' is dismissed in favor of 'HPA Axis Dysregulation.' What is the primary physiological reason for this shift in terminology?",
            "options": [
                "The adrenal glands physically atrophy and stop producing cortisol entirely",
                "The problem usually lies in the brain's signaling and feedback loops rather than gland failure",
                "Cortisol levels are always high in chronic stress, never low",
                "The adrenal glands are only involved in acute stress, not chronic stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that in most cases of chronic stress, the adrenal glands remain capable of producing cortisol, but the central nervous system downregulates the signal (HPA axis) to protect the body from overexposure."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to the TAO Axis (Thyroid-Adrenal-Ovarian/Testicular) integration, how does elevated chronic cortisol typically affect thyroid hormone metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone",
                "It has no measurable effect on thyroid function",
                "It inhibits 5'-deiodinase activity, increasing the production of inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "It stimulates the thyroid gland to overproduce TSH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels prioritize survival over metabolism, leading to the inhibition of the enzyme that converts T4 to active T3, instead shunting T4 into the metabolic 'brake' known as Reverse T3."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Metabolic Endotoxemia is characterized by the translocation of which substance into systemic circulation?",
            "options": [
                "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria",
                "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic endotoxemia occurs when LPS (endotoxins from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria) crosses the intestinal barrier, triggering systemic low-grade inflammation."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In the context of neuroinflammation, what is the 'priming' effect observed in microglial cells?",
            "options": [
                "Microglia become permanently dormant to protect the brain",
                "Initial insults cause microglia to become hypersensitive, leading to an exaggerated inflammatory response to future stressors",
                "Microglia begin to produce myelin to speed up nerve conduction",
                "The blood-brain barrier thickens to prevent any further immune cell entry"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Microglial priming occurs when a primary insult (like trauma or systemic infection) leaves these brain-resident immune cells in a 'ready' state, where even minor subsequent triggers cause massive pro-inflammatory cytokine release."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CDR is a programmed evolutionary response where mitochondria stop focusing on oxidative phosphorylation (energy) and instead stiffen cell membranes and release signaling molecules to coordinate a defense."

            "options": [
                "Increased intestinal permeability leading to systemic LPS, which triggers neuroinflammation via the Vagus nerve and BBB",
                "A direct deficiency in dietary glucose reaching the brain",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High Zonulin indicates 'leaky gut,' allowing LPS to enter the blood. This triggers systemic inflammation that can cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) or signal through the Vagus nerve to activate microglial cells, causing 'brain fog.'"
