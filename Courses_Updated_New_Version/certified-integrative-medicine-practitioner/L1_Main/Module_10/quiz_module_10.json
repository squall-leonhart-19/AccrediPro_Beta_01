            "options": [
                "The genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease regardless of environment",
                "The totality of environmental exposures throughout the lifespan and their cumulative biological impact",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and other EDCs act as obesogens by activating Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which signals the body to create more fat cells and store more fat."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which heavy metal is known for its 'molecular mimicry' of calcium and zinc, allowing it to cross the blood-brain barrier and interfere with neurotransmitter release?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lead (Pb) is a potent neurotoxin that mimics calcium, allowing it to bypass the blood-brain barrier and disrupt essential calcium-dependent signaling in the brain."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), what percentage of the population carries the HLA-DR genetic susceptibility that prevents the immune system from 'tagging' and clearing biotoxins?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Roughly 25% of the population has the HLA-DR genetic haplotype that makes them unable to effectively process and clear biotoxins from mold or Lyme, leading to chronic inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III involves transporters, specifically the ABC transporters (like P-glycoprotein), which pump neutralized toxins out of cells into the bile or urine for excretion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
