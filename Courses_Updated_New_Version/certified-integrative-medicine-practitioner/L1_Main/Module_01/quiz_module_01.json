            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary shift from the traditional Biomedical model to the Biopsychosocial model in integrative practice?",
            "options": [
                "A focus on pharmaceutical interventions over lifestyle changes",
                "The recognition that biological, psychological, and social factors are inextricably linked in health outcomes",
                "The exclusion of genetic factors in favor of environmental determinants",
                "A reliance on standardized laboratory values rather than patient-reported symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Biopsychosocial model posits that health and illness are the products of a complex interaction between biological (genetic, biochemical), psychological (mood, personality), and social (cultural, familial, socioeconomic) factors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Antecedents are 'pre-existing' factors, such as genetics, birth history, or early childhood environment, that set the stage for later health issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Night sweats and unintentional weight loss are classic 'red flags' that require investigation into systemic issues like occult infection, autoimmune flares, or malignancy before proceeding with lifestyle-only interventions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from new building materials are significant environmental exposures that contribute to total toxic load but are often overlooked in traditional intakes."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "According to the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study, an individual with an ACE score of 4 or higher is significantly more likely to develop which of the following?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A score of 4 or higher is a major threshold in the ACE study, correlating with a vastly increased risk for chronic conditions like COPD, heart disease, and mental health disorders."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Research into Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) suggests that what percentage of health outcomes are driven by factors outside of clinical medical care?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Estimates frequently show that 80% of health outcomes are determined by SDoH (environment, socioeconomic status, social support) rather than direct medical interventions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MSQ is a quantitative tool that aggregates symptoms across all body systems to give a 'score' of total burden, making it excellent for tracking the efficacy of an intervention."

                "To correct the patient's version of events with medical terminology",
                "To create a cohesive story that links the patient's history to their current symptoms for 'meaning-making'",
                "To find the single 'root cause' that explains every symptom",
                "To prepare a legal document for insurance reimbursement only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The narrative synthesis helps the patient feel heard and provides a framework (meaning-making) for why they are ill and how they can get better."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
