            "question": "According to Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory, which specific branch of the nervous system is responsible for the 'Social Engagement System' and facilitates feelings of safety and connection?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic-Adrenal Medullary (SAM) Axis",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the 'newest' part of the vagus nerve evolutionarily, governing social engagement, facial expression, and vocalization, allowing for physiological calm in the presence of others."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the SE process of experiencing small 'drops' of the survival charge so the client's nervous system can integrate the experience without becoming overwhelmed."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
