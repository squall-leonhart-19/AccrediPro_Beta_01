            "question": "The 'Exposome' concept, first coined by Christopher Wild in 2005, is best defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The total genetic expression resulting from environmental stressors.",

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Which Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC) is specifically known as an 'obesogen' due to its ability to activate the PPAR-gamma receptor and promote adipogenesis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heavy metals have a high affinity for thiol/sulfhydryl groups, which inhibits critical enzymes in the Krebs cycle and the Electron Transport Chain, leading to oxidative stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "In Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), which biomarker is typically elevated and indicates a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Alkaline Phosphatase",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MMP-9 is a key biomarker in CIRS (often caused by mold/biotoxins) that reflects the movement of inflammatory elements from the blood into the extravascular space."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "When assessing heavy metal burden, why is a 'provoked' urine test often preferred over a standard blood test for chronic toxicity?",
            "options": [
                "Blood tests only measure recent exposure (past 24-72 hours), whereas provocation reveals the total body burden stored in tissues.",
                "Provoked urine tests are cheaper and do not require a clinician's oversight.",
                "Blood tests are unable to detect mercury or lead at any concentration.",
                "Urine tests measure the genetic predisposition to toxicity rather than the metal itself."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Blood tests reflect acute exposure. Because metals are rapidly sequestered into tissues (bone, brain, fat), a chelating agent (provocation) is needed to mobilize them into the urine for assessment."

                "A 3-day water fast to deplete glycogen stores."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mobilizing toxins without ensuring the exit pathways (emunctories) are open leads to 're-toxification' and significant side effects (Herxheimer reactions)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "VCS failure and low MSH are hallmark clinical indicators of CIRS, reflecting the neurological and neuroendocrine impact of biotoxin exposure."
