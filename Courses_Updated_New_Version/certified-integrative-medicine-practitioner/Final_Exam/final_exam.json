            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In The B.R.I.D.G.E. Framework™, what is the primary distinction between the 'B' (Biopsychosocial Intake) and a traditional conventional medical intake?",
            "options": [
                "The Biopsychosocial Intake focuses exclusively on genetic predispositions and lab results.",
                "The Biopsychosocial Intake integrates environmental exposures, mental-emotional states, and social determinants of health alongside medical history.",
                "The Biopsychosocial Intake is only used for psychological disorders, while conventional intake is for physical ones.",
                "There is no distinction; they are functionally identical in a clinical setting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'B' in BRIDGE stands for Biopsychosocial Intake, which expands the clinical lens to include the 'Exposome'—the sum of environmental, social, and psychological factors that influence gene expression and physiological function."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "During the 'R' (Root Cause Analysis) phase, a practitioner identifies 'Mediators.' How are Mediators defined in the context of functional inquiry?",
            "options": [
                "The initial event that triggered the illness (e.g., a viral infection).",
                "Genetic predispositions that make a client vulnerable to specific conditions.",
                "Factors—biochemical or psychosocial—that contribute to the ongoing persistence of a symptom or pathological state.",
                "The pharmaceutical interventions used to suppress symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mediators are factors that keep a pathological process 'going.' While antecedents are predispositions and triggers are the 'spark,' mediators (like chronic inflammation or ongoing stress) sustain the dysfunction."

                "An increase in Secretory IgA (sIgA) levels, enhancing mucosal immunity.",
                "A shift toward Th1 dominance, increasing the risk of acute viral infections.",
                "A suppression of Secretory IgA (sIgA) and a shift toward Th2 dominance, potentially increasing allergic reactivity and lowering mucosal defense.",
                "The complete cessation of cytokine production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress (HPA axis activation) and elevated cortisol are known to suppress sIgA (the first line of defense in the gut/lungs) and can cause a Th2 shift, which is associated with allergies and asthma rather than acute cellular defense."

                "Prescribe high doses of caffeine throughout the shift to maintain cortisol levels.",
                "Ignore the light-dark cycle and focus only on macronutrient ratios."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dynamic Lifestyle Modification requires anchoring the circadian rhythm. For shift workers, this means manipulating light exposure (the primary zeitgeber) to signal 'day' and 'night' to the master clock (SCN) at appropriate times for their schedule."

        {
            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'Gold Standard' for measuring the success of 'G' (Guided Resilience) interventions and assessing autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance?",
            "options": [
                "Resting Heart Rate (RHR)",

        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "When developing an 'I' (Integrative Strategy), why must a practitioner screen for 'Polypharmacy' in elderly clients?",
            "options": [
                "Because elderly clients cannot metabolize supplements.",
                "To identify potential herb-drug interactions and 'nutrient depletions' caused by long-term medication use (e.g., Statins depleting CoQ10).",
                "Because supplements are more effective than medications in all cases.",
                "To ensure the client is taking at least five different medications."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrative Strategy bridges conventional and natural care. A core responsibility is identifying where medications may be causing secondary nutrient deficiencies or where botanical agents might interfere with drug metabolism (CYP450 enzymes)."

            "id": "final_13",
            "question": "In Module 22 (Ethical Considerations), what is the 'Scope of Practice' boundary regarding medical diagnoses for a non-licensed Integrative Health Practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Practitioners can diagnose any condition if they use functional labs.",
                "Practitioners provide 'clinical impressions' and 'functional assessments' but do not diagnose or treat named medical diseases.",
                "Practitioners can diagnose as long as they don't prescribe drugs.",
                "There are no scope of practice boundaries in integrative medicine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To remain compliant and ethical, non-licensed practitioners must use language that reflects health optimization and functional balance, referring clients to medical doctors for the diagnosis and treatment of specific diseases."
