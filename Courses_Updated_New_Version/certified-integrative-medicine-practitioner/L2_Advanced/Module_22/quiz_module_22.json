            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scope of practice is defined by the specific licensure and training of a practitioner; performing clinical tasks like ordering diagnostics without a medical license is a violation of the 'Integrative Frontier' boundaries."

            "options": [

                "The cost of the supplement compared to pharmaceutical alternatives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True informed consent in integrative medicine requires 'Shared Decision-Making,' which must include a transparent comparison of risks and benefits between the proposed intervention and the conventional standard of care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical supplementation requires full disclosure of financial conflicts of interest and ensuring the client does not feel pressured by providing alternative, non-affiliated options."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the information age, practitioners must vet the data privacy policies of third-party apps to ensure client health data is protected and not exploited by data brokers."

            "options": [
                "Competence is about mastery of facts; Humility is a lifelong process of self-critique and power-balancing",
                "Humility is only for practitioners working in rural areas",
                "Competence is more advanced than humility",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility emphasizes that a practitioner can never 'master' another's culture, requiring ongoing self-reflection and the addressing of power imbalances in the practitioner-client relationship."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "A practitioner's website states: 'I can find and fix the root cause of your autoimmune disease in 30 days.' Why does this violate Marketing Ethics?",
            "options": [
                "Because autoimmune diseases always take 60 days to fix",
                "It uses a 'Cure' narrative and makes an absolute claim that cannot be scientifically guaranteed",
                "It doesn't include a picture of the practitioner",
                "It is only unethical if the practitioner charges more than $500"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing avoids the 'Root Cause/Cure' trap. Making absolute claims about 'fixing' complex conditions is misleading and potentially harmful to patient expectations and safety."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "According to the ethics of 'Professional Competence,' why is practitioner self-care considered an ethical duty rather than just a personal choice?",
            "options": [
                "To look good for marketing materials",
                "To ensure the practitioner can work 80 hours a week",
                "Because impairment from burnout or 'empathy fatigue' can lead to clinical errors and poor judgment",
                "It is not an ethical duty; it is only a suggestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioner self-care is an ethical imperative because a practitioner's physical and mental well-being directly impacts their ability to provide safe, competent, and objective care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shared decision-making (SDM) fosters trust and autonomy, which has been shown to significantly increase patient adherence and satisfaction in integrative care models."
