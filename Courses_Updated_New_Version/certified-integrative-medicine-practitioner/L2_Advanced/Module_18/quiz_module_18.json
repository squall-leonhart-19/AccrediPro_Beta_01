            "question": "In the B.R.I.D.G.E. Framework™, what distinguishes 'Advanced Biopsychosocial Intake (B)' from a standard medical history?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses exclusively on genetic SNP analysis and lab markers.",
                "It integrates the client's narrative, subjective meaning of illness, and social determinants of health alongside clinical data.",
                "It is a shorter version of the history designed for rapid triage.",
                "It prioritizes the practitioner's observations over the client's reported symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced Biopsychosocial Intake moves beyond the 'what' (symptoms) to the 'who' and 'why,' incorporating the client's life context, psychological state, and social environment to create a complete clinical picture."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "When identifying 'Complex Root Cause Mapping (R) Bottlenecks,' which system is typically addressed first if multiple dysfunctions are present?",
            "options": [
                "Hormonal replacement therapy for low libido.",
                "Advanced heavy metal chelation.",
                "Primary elimination pathways (bowel, kidney, skin) and sleep hygiene.",
                "High-intensity interval training for metabolic flexibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In clinical synthesis, primary bottlenecks—such as poor elimination or lack of restorative sleep—must be resolved first. Attempting to detoxify or stimulate a system that cannot eliminate waste or recover leads to 'healing crises' and poor outcomes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on 'The Integrative Strategy (I),' what is the recommended limit for primary therapeutic interventions in a single phase to avoid 'intervention fatigue'?",
            "options": [
                "No more than 1 intervention.",
                "Exactly 5 supplements and 2 lifestyle changes.",
                "The 'Rule of Three': limiting to three high-impact, prioritized changes.",
                "As many as the client is willing to pay for to ensure rapid results."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of Three' is a cornerstone of prioritization in the B.R.I.D.G.E. framework, ensuring that the client is not overwhelmed and that the practitioner can accurately track which intervention is producing specific results."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "For a client presenting with 'Low-Vitality' (Lesson 5), characterized by Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), which approach is clinically indicated?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Push-through' method to build aerobic capacity.",
                "Pacing and energy conservation to stay within the 'Energy Envelope'.",
                "Strict ketogenic dieting to force mitochondrial adaptation.",
                "Daily cold plunges to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In low-vitality states like CFS or burnout, 'pushing' can trigger a crash. Pacing and respecting the 'Energy Envelope' allows the mitochondria to recover without triggering the cell danger response (CDR)."

        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "In 'Synthesizing Guided Resilience (G),' what does Somatic-Visceral Integration specifically address?",

                "The prescription of pharmaceutical prokinetics for motility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guided Resilience focuses on the gut-brain axis and how somatic (body-based) signals influence visceral (organ) function, often utilizing vagal tone optimization to shift the client out of a chronic 'fight or flight' state."

        {
            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "A practitioner transitions a client to 'Enduring Wellness (E)' when the client demonstrates:",

                "The completion of a 12-month protocol regardless of symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'E' in B.R.I.D.G.E. represents the transition from practitioner-led care to client self-efficacy, where the individual has the tools and internal awareness to maintain their own health."

                "Starting a high-dose iodine protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep is a foundational bottleneck. Without addressing the circadian rhythm and the stress response (HPA axis), thyroid medication or immune interventions are often ineffective or poorly tolerated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "What is 'Pattern Recognition' in the context of Clinical Reasoning (Lesson 1)?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to see recurring themes across physiological systems rather than isolated symptoms.",

                "Identifying the astrological signs of the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Synthesis requires pattern recognition—the ability to see how disparate symptoms (e.g., skin rashes, bloating, and brain fog) may all point to a single underlying mechanism like intestinal permeability or systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, what is defined as a 'Physiological Bottleneck'?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of financial resources for testing.",
                "A specific point in a metabolic or systemic pathway that restricts the flow of healing for the entire organism.",
                "The physical size of the esophagus.",
                "A client's refusal to take supplements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A physiological bottleneck is a rate-limiting step in recovery, such as impaired liver phase II detoxification or poor mitochondrial ATP production, that prevents other interventions from working."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "Which statistic best reflects the importance of the 'Biopsychosocial' approach in chronic disease management mentioned in the module?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic factors account for 95% of all chronic disease outcomes.",
                "Social and lifestyle factors (the 'Exposome') contribute to an estimated 70-90% of chronic disease risk.",
                "Medication adherence is 100% when the practitioner is authoritative.",
                "Psychological stress has no measurable effect on C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the vast majority of chronic disease (70-90%) is driven by the exposome—the cumulative environmental and lifestyle exposures—rather than genetics alone, justifying the B.R.I.D.G.E. focus on lifestyle and environment."
