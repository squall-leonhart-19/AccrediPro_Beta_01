            "options": [
                "Optimal ranges are based on the central 95% of the population visiting that specific lab.",
                "Optimal ranges are narrower and represent the levels associated with the lowest risk of disease and highest physiological function.",
                "Optimal ranges are always 20% higher than standard ranges to account for nutrient depletion.",
                "Standard ranges are designed for preventive health, while optimal ranges are designed for acute pathology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard reference ranges are statistical averages of the 'sick' population visiting labs, whereas optimal ranges are evidence-based targets associated with peak health and minimal disease risk."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR 677C>T mutation reduces the efficiency of the MTHFR enzyme, which is responsible for creating the active form of folate (5-MTHF) used in the methylation cycle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secretory IgA is the first line of defense in the gut; elevated levels indicate the immune system is actively responding to a perceived threat or irritation in the mucosa."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolized cortisol (THF and THE) represents roughly 80% of total cortisol production, providing a better reflection of total adrenal output than free cortisol alone."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "In the context of Environmental Burden assessment, why is a 'provoked' urinary heavy metal test sometimes preferred over a standard blood test for chronic toxicity?",
            "options": [
                "Blood tests only show recent exposure (last 48-72 hours), while provocation helps mobilize metals stored in tissues.",
                "Blood tests are unable to detect lead or mercury.",
                "Urinary tests are cheaper and do not require a practitioner's order.",
                "Provocation tests are the only way to measure essential minerals like Zinc and Magnesium."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Heavy metals are quickly cleared from the blood and stored in tissues (bones, fat, organs). Provocation using a chelating agent helps reveal this 'body burden' that a blood test would miss."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is a primary Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric; higher values indicate robust parasympathetic (vagal) activity and better autonomic resilience."
