            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "A patient presents with low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and chronic sympathetic dominance. According to L4, which bioelectronic intervention would be most appropriate?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "tVNS targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve to increase parasympathetic tone and improve HRV."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Before administering high-dose Intravenous Vitamin C (IVC) in an integrative oncology setting (L5/L8), which enzyme deficiency must be ruled out to prevent hemolytic anemia?",
            "options": ["MTHFR", "COMT", "G6PD", "CYP2D6"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a strict contraindication for high-dose IVC as it can lead to the rupture of red blood cells."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In the HPA-HPT-HPG interplay (L6), how does chronic hypercortisolemia typically affect thyroid function?",
            "options": ["It increases the conversion of T4 to T3", "It inhibits the conversion of T4 to T3 and increases Reverse T3 (rT3)", "It stimulates TSH production via the pituitary", "It has no measurable effect on thyroid hormones"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, reducing active T3 levels and increasing the production of the metabolic 'brake,' Reverse T3."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "Mitochondrial Medicine (L7) identifies the 'Warburg Effect' as a hallmark of metabolic inflexibility. What does this effect describe?",
            "options": ["The preference for oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen", "The shift to aerobic glycolysis even when oxygen is available", "The inability to utilize ketones for fuel", "The excessive production of ATP in the mitochondria"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Warburg Effect is the phenomenon where cells (notably cancer cells) switch to glycolysis for energy production despite having sufficient oxygen for more efficient mitochondrial respiration."

        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "Which peptide bioregulator is specifically known for its ability to regulate the pineal gland and potentially extend lifespan by modulating telomerase (L3)?",
            "options": ["Thymosin Alpha-1", "Cerebrolysin", "Epitalon (Epithalon)", "LL-37"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Epitalon is a synthetic version of the pineal-derived peptide epithalamin, known for its role in telomere lengthening and circadian rhythm regulation."

            "options": ["To acutely lower blood pressure", "To bypass the digestive tract and rapidly restore cellular energy and DNA repair", "To act as a primary antioxidant for heavy metal chelation", "To provide a direct source of glucose to the brain"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IV NAD+ bypasses rate-limiting steps in the gut to immediately provide the coenzyme necessary for ATP production in the electron transport chain and PARP-mediated DNA repair."
