        {
            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1 (Complex Autoimmunity), which specific cytokine is primarily responsible for the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by inducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases?",
            "options": ["IL-10", "IL-17A", "TGF-Beta", "IL-4"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IL-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by Th17 cells that has been shown to disrupt the blood-brain barrier and promote neuroinflammation in complex autoimmune presentations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Metabolic Gridlock, a HOMA-IR score above which threshold is generally considered diagnostic of significant insulin resistance in a clinical setting?",
            "options": ["1.0", "1.5", "1.9", "3.0"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While 'optimal' is often below 1.5, a HOMA-IR score > 3.0 indicates significant insulin resistance and 'metabolic gridlock' where cellular glucose uptake is severely impaired."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 regarding Neuro-Degenerative Decline, which marker found on an Organic Acids Test (OAT) is a direct byproduct of the Kynurenine pathway and indicates neuroexcitotoxicity?",
            "options": ["Quinolinic Acid", "Citramalic Acid", "Tartaric Acid", "Succinic Acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Quinolinic acid is a neurotoxic metabolite of the kynurenine pathway; elevated levels indicate microglial activation and potential NMDA receptor overstimulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Lesson 6 (Biotoxin Illness) identifies several biomarkers for Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). Which marker, when elevated above 2380 pg/mL, is most indicative of T-regulatory cell dysfunction and systemic autoimmunity?",
            "options": ["C4a", "MMP-9", "TGF-beta1", "MSH"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TGF-beta1 levels above 2380 pg/mL in the context of CIRS often indicate a shift toward autoimmunity and a failure of T-regulatory cell suppression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 7 (Integrative Oncology), the concept of 'Differential Stress Resistance' (DSR) explains why which intervention can protect healthy cells while sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy?",
            "options": ["High-protein loading", "Short-term fasting or Fasting Mimicking Diets (FMD)", "High-dose Vitamin C (Oral)", "Continuous glucose infusion"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Differential Stress Resistance (DSR) refers to the phenomenon where healthy cells enter a protected state during fasting, while cancer cells remain focused on growth and become more vulnerable to oxidative stress (chemo)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "The BRIDGE framework (Lesson 8) uses the 'D' to represent Detoxification. Which Phase II conjugation pathway is most likely to be impaired in a client with low glycine and chronic exposure to environmental salicylates?",
            "options": ["Sulfation", "Glucuronidation", "Amino Acid Conjugation", "Acetylation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Amino acid conjugation, specifically the glycine buffer system, is required for the detoxification of salicylates and benzoate; deficiency leads to 'mystery' symptoms and chemical sensitivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "A 'Tired Wired' client (Lesson 3) presents with a 'flat' diurnal cortisol curve and elevated midnight cortisol. This pattern is most characteristic of which HPA-axis state?",
            "options": ["Phase 1: Acute Stress", "Phase 2: Resistance (Wired and Tired)", "Phase 3: Exhaustion", "Circadian Dysregulation/Inverted Rhythm"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "An inverted rhythm (low morning, high night) is a hallmark of advanced HPA-axis dysfunction where the circadian timing mechanism is disrupted, often seen in shift workers or chronic biotoxin illness."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Lesson 5 notes that even in 'Lean PCOS' phenotypes, what percentage of women still demonstrate underlying insulin resistance?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Up to 75%", "Nearly 100%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that up to 75% of lean women with PCOS exhibit some degree of insulin resistance, highlighting that IR is a core driver of the condition regardless of BMI."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, which liver enzyme ratio is suggested as a surrogate marker for early non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic inflexibility when the values are within the 'standard' lab range?",
            "options": ["ALT/AST ratio > 1.0", "AST/ALT ratio > 2.0", "GGT < 10", "ALP/GGT ratio < 0.5"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An ALT that is higher than AST (ALT/AST ratio > 1.0) is often an early indicator of hepatic insulin resistance and fat accumulation in the liver, even if both are within the 'normal' range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, what percentage of the general population carries the HLA-DR genetic susceptibility haplotypes that make them unable to recognize and clear biotoxins like mold and Lyme?",
            "options": ["2%", "10%", "25%", "50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 25% of the population carries the HLA-DR 'multi-susceptible' or 'mold-susceptible' genes, preventing their immune systems from properly tagging and removing biotoxins."
