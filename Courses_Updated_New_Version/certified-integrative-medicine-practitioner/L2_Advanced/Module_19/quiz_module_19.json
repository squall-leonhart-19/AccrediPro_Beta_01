            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the 'gold standard' of primary research and sit just below secondary syntheses (Systematic Reviews/Meta-Analyses) in the evidence hierarchy."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "When critically appraising a clinical trial, a researcher notes an 'Intention-to-Treat' (ITT) analysis was used. What is the primary purpose of ITT?",
            "options": [
                "To exclude participants who did not adhere to the protocol",
                "To increase the statistical power by only including successful outcomes",
                "To maintain the benefits of randomization and prevent bias caused by participant dropouts",
                "To ensure that only the most healthy participants are analyzed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intention-to-Treat analysis includes all participants who were randomized, regardless of whether they completed the intervention, which preserves randomization and reflects real-world clinical 'effectiveness'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "N-of-1 trials are ideal for chronic, stable conditions where interventions have a rapid onset and short washout period, allowing for multiple crossover cycles in a single patient."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A patient presents with a serum ferritin level of 22 ng/mL. While the standard laboratory reference range is 15–150 ng/mL, an integrative practitioner identifies this as 'suboptimal.' This is an example of using:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional reference ranges are narrower than standard ranges and aim to identify 'optimal' physiological function rather than just the absence of clinical disease."

            "id": "q19_5",

            "options": [
                "There is low heterogeneity; the studies are very similar in their results",
                "The results are 75% likely to be true in a clinical setting",
                "There is high heterogeneity; the differences between study results are likely not due to chance",
                "The meta-analysis included 75 different clinical trials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The I² statistic measures heterogeneity. A value of 75% or higher is generally considered high heterogeneity, suggesting significant variance between the studies included in the meta-analysis."

            "explanation": "The BRIDGE Framework™ emphasizes Risk-Benefit Assessment, ensuring that the clinical evidence for an intervention is weighed against the potential for adverse effects and the patient's unique risk profile."

            "options": [
                "The intervention should be used regardless of evidence if the patient requests it",
                "In the absence of scientific consensus, if an action has a suspected risk of causing harm, the burden of proof that it is NOT harmful falls on those taking the action",
                "Only interventions with 100% guaranteed safety profiles should ever be used",
                "Practitioners should wait for a Meta-Analysis before recommending any lifestyle change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Precautionary Principle suggests that if an intervention carries a suspected risk of harm, caution should be exercised even if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the simple arithmetic difference between the control group risk and the treatment group risk (10% - 5% = 5%)."
