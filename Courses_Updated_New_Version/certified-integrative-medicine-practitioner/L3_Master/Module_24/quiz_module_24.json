            "options": [
                "Review the client's financial budget for supplements",
                "Root cause identification by mapping physiological interconnections",

                "Refer the client to a surgical specialist immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in B.R.I.D.G.E. stands for Root Cause Identification, which involves looking beyond symptoms to map the underlying physiological and biochemical drivers of dysfunction."

            "question": "When performing Master-Level Functional Lab Interpretation, which finding is often considered a 'functional' warning sign of insulin resistance, even if fasting glucose is within the standard reference range?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Functional medicine practitioners look for optimal ranges; a fasting insulin above 7 μIU/mL (some argue >5) often indicates early metabolic dysfunction even when glucose remains 'normal' on standard labs."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner is orchestrating a complex protocol for a client with mold illness, SIBO, and HPA-axis dysfunction. According to the 'Peeling the Onion' strategy, which is generally addressed FIRST?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To avoid Herxheimer reactions and 'flare-ups,' practitioners must ensure drainage pathways (liver, lymph, bowel) are open and the nervous system is regulated before introducing aggressive binders or antimicrobials."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "In Behavioral Science, a client who says, 'I know I need to change my diet, and I've been reading about it, but I'm not ready to start until after the holidays,' is in which stage of change?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Contemplation is characterized by the acknowledgment of a problem and the intent to change in the future, but without a concrete plan or immediate action."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow COMT results in slower breakdown of dopamine and estrogen; these individuals are often more prone to anxiety and benefit from magnesium and stress management to help clear catecholamines."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SBAR stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. The Background provides the necessary clinical context for the other provider to understand the case."

            "options": [
                "Life Span is the total years lived; Health Span is the years lived in high functional health",
                "They are synonyms and can be used interchangeably",
                "Health Span refers only to the absence of terminal cancer",
                "Life Span is determined by genetics, while Health Span is determined only by luck"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The goal of integrative medicine is to compress morbidity, meaning we want the Health Span (quality of life) to match the Life Span (quantity of life) as closely as possible."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' TSH but high Reverse T3 (rT3) and low Free T3. In the context of Advanced Clinical Reasoning, this pattern most likely indicates:",

                "An iodine deficiency that requires high-dose supplementation",
                "Cellular hypothyroidism or 'Euthyroid Sick Syndrome' often driven by systemic inflammation",
                "The client is hyperthyroid and needs methimazole",
                "A lab error, as TSH is the only reliable marker of thyroid health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated rT3 is a protective mechanism where the body diverts T4 into an inactive form (rT3) instead of active T3, often due to chronic stress, inflammation, or caloric restriction."
