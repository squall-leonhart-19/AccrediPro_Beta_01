            "question": "In Integrative Oncology, which mechanism explains why high-dose intravenous Vitamin C (IVC) is used as a pro-oxidant therapy rather than an antioxidant in a cancer context?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the production of extracellular hydrogen peroxide, which selectively generates oxidative stress in cancer cells lacking catalase.",
                "It directly inhibits the mTOR pathway, preventing protein synthesis in rapidly dividing tumor cells.",
                "It acts as a buffer for mitochondrial pH, allowing chemotherapy to penetrate the cell membrane more effectively.",
                "It competitively inhibits glucose transporters (GLUT1), effectively starving the tumor of its primary fuel source."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "At high concentrations achieved through IV administration, Vitamin C acts as a pro-drug for the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the interstitial fluid. Because many cancer cells are deficient in catalase and glutathione peroxidase, they cannot neutralize this oxidative stress, leading to selective cytotoxicity."

            "question": "The Bredesen Protocol (ReCODE) for reversing cognitive decline emphasizes a specific metabolic state known as 'Ketoflex 12/3'. What does the '12/3' signify?",
            "options": [
                "A 12-hour fast between the first and last meal, with 3 hours of aerobic exercise per week.",
                "A 12-hour minimum overnight fast, with at least 3 hours between the last meal and bedtime.",
                "A ratio of 12 parts healthy fats to 3 parts complex carbohydrates to maintain ketosis.",
                "12 minutes of HIIT training followed by 3 minutes of cognitive brain games daily."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ketoflex 12/3 refers to a 12-hour minimum overnight fast and a 3-hour window between the final meal of the day and sleep. This timing optimizes autophagy, insulin sensitivity, and glymphatic clearance, which are critical for clearing amyloid-beta plaques."

            "question": "When evaluating a pediatric patient for PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome), which clinical feature distinguishes it from a standard gradual-onset OCD diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "A slow, progressive decline in social skills over 12-18 months.",
                "The presence of a confirmed Group A Streptococcal infection within the last 48 hours.",
                "An abrupt, 'overnight' dramatic onset of OCD symptoms or severe food restriction.",
                "A positive family history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While PANDAS is specifically triggered by Strep, PANS is defined by the sudden, dramatic 'cliff-like' onset of OCD or restrictive eating, often accompanied by other neuropsychiatric symptoms like tics, anxiety, or urinary frequency, regardless of the triggering pathogen."

            "question": "In Longevity Medicine, 'Senolytics' are a class of compounds designed to target which specific Hallmark of Aging?",
            "options": [
                "Telomere attrition",

                "Cellular senescence",
                "Deregulated nutrient sensing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senolytics (such as Quercetin, Dasatinib, and Fisetin) are agents that selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells. These 'zombie cells' accumulate with age and secrete the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), which drives systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "According to the literature on Integrative Sports Medicine, what is the primary mechanism by which dietary nitrates (e.g., from beetroot juice) enhance human performance?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the rate of muscle protein synthesis via leucine-triggering.",
                "Reducing the oxygen cost of exercise by improving mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratio).",
                "Acting as a central nervous system stimulant to mask the perception of fatigue.",
                "Increasing the buffering capacity of the blood to neutralize lactic acid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dietary nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which improves the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. Studies show that nitrate supplementation reduces the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise, meaning the athlete can perform the same amount of work with less oxygen."

            "question": "In Advanced Reproductive Health, why is Coenzyme Q10 (specifically in the Ubiquinol form) frequently prescribed for women over the age of 35 seeking to conceive?",
            "options": [
                "To thicken the endometrial lining for better implantation.",
                "To suppress high levels of Prolactin that may interfere with ovulation.",
                "To support mitochondrial ATP production in the oocyte, which is essential for proper chromosomal division.",
                "To act as a precursor to Progesterone during the luteal phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oocytes have the highest concentration of mitochondria of any cell in the body. As women age, mitochondrial function declines, leading to 'energy failure' during meiosis, which increases the risk of aneuploidy (chromosomal abnormalities). Ubiquinol supports the ATP production required for successful fertilization and early embryo development."

            "question": "Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) is utilized in complex autoimmune cases. What is its proposed mechanism for modulating the immune system?",
            "options": [
                "It permanently blocks opioid receptors, preventing the 'high' associated with inflammatory cytokines.",
                "It causes a temporary blockade of opioid receptors, leading to a compensatory 'rebound' increase in endogenous endorphins and T-regulatory cells.",
                "It acts as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressant similar to Prednisone, but with fewer side effects.",
                "It stimulates the Th17 pathway to aggressively target underlying viral triggers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LDN (typically 1.5mg to 4.5mg) briefly binds to opioid receptors. When the drug clears, the body responds by increasing the production of met-enkephalin and endorphins, which helps upregulate T-regulatory (Treg) cells and reduce pro-inflammatory Th17 activity."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In Integrative Psychiatry, the 'Kynurenine Pathway' explains how systemic inflammation leads to depression. When IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) is activated by stress or infection, what happens to Tryptophan?",
            "options": [
                "Tryptophan is converted into more Serotonin to compensate for the stress.",
                "Tryptophan is shunted away from Serotonin production and toward the production of neurotoxic metabolites like Quinolinic Acid.",
                "Tryptophan is stored in the liver, leading to a systemic deficiency in all neurotransmitters.",
                "Tryptophan is converted into Melatonin prematurely, causing daytime somnolence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammatory cytokines activate the IDO enzyme, which diverts Tryptophan away from the Serotonin pathway and into the Kynurenine pathway. This results in decreased serotonin (low mood) and increased Quinolinic Acid, an NMDA agonist that causes neurotoxicity and 'brain fog'."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the Longevity lesson suggests that 'Biological Age' (as measured by DNA methylation/Horvath Clocks) is most significantly reduced by which intervention?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose antioxidant supplementation (Vitamin E and C).",
                "A combination of caloric restriction, sleep hygiene, and targeted phytonutrients (the 'Longevity Lifestyle').",
                "Weekly intravenous ozone therapy.",
                "Replacing all dietary animal protein with soy-based protein isolates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into epigenetic clocks shows that multi-modal lifestyle interventions—including a nutrient-dense diet, caloric restriction/fasting, exercise, and stress management—can 'rewind' the epigenetic clock by several years, whereas single-nutrient interventions rarely show the same impact on DNA methylation patterns."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "Which pediatric 'Immune-Gut' concept suggests that a lack of early childhood exposure to diverse microorganisms and symbiotic parasites increases susceptibility to allergic and autoimmune diseases?",
            "options": [
                "The Germ Theory of Disease",
                "The Microbiome Seeding Hypothesis",
                "The Hygiene Hypothesis (or Old Friends Hypothesis)",
                "The Leaky Gut-Leaky Brain Theory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hygiene Hypothesis (often updated to the 'Old Friends' Hypothesis) posits that the human immune system evolved alongside diverse microbes. Without this early 'training' of T-regulatory cells, the immune system becomes hypersensitive, leading to the modern rise in asthma, allergies, and autoimmunity."
