            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Premature closure is the tendency to stop the diagnostic process before all possibilities have been explored, often leading to misdiagnosis or missing co-morbidities."

            "question": "According to the 'B' in the BRIDGE framework (L2), a client with an ACE (Adverse Childhood Experience) score of 4 or higher is statistically how much more likely to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared to someone with a score of 0?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first step in the Therapeutic Order is always 'Establishing the Conditions for Health' by removing obstacles to healing, which allows the body's innate self-healing mechanisms to function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blue light in the 460–480 nm range is the primary stimulus for melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells, which signal the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to suppress melatonin."

            "question": "A client presents with brain fog, joint pain, and bloating. Using the 'R' mapping (L3), you identify 'Intestinal Permeability' as the central node. Which mechanism best explains this cross-system connection?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Leaky Gut' allows lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to enter systemic circulation, triggering systemic inflammation and blood-brain barrier permeability",
                "Bloating causes physical pressure on the vagus nerve, leading to joint pain",
                "Joint pain is caused by a lack of dietary protein absorption",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Intestinal permeability (Leaky Gut) allows endotoxins like LPS into the blood, which triggers a systemic inflammatory response (affecting joints) and neuroinflammation (affecting cognitive function/brain fog)."
