            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "When defining the 'Scope of Crisis' in Lesson 1, which of the following 'Red Flags' necessitates an immediate referral to emergency services or a specialist rather than integrative management?",
            "options": [
                "New-onset mild digestive bloating after meals",
                "Sudden, unexplained focal neurological deficits or 'thunderclap' headaches",
                "Chronic fatigue lasting more than six months",
                "Mild seasonal affective disorder symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sudden neurological deficits or thunderclap headaches are 'Red Flags' for stroke or hemorrhage, falling outside the integrative scope and requiring immediate emergency medical intervention."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the Advanced Biopsychosocial Intake (B) for high-acuity scenarios, why is identifying a 'Primary Support Person' (PSP) considered a clinical priority?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner gets paid on time",
                "To delegate the practitioner's charting responsibilities",
                "To ensure safety, treatment compliance, and monitoring of symptoms when the client is cognitively or physically overwhelmed",
                "To provide a witness for legal liability only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-acuity cases, clients often lack the 'bandwidth' to manage complex protocols; a PSP is essential for safety and ensuring the stabilization plan is actually followed."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses Root Cause Analysis (R) in 'Multi-System Collapse.' Which physiological triad is most frequently implicated in cases where multiple systems are failing simultaneously?",
            "options": [
                "HPA Axis dysregulation, Systemic Inflammation (Immune), and Mitochondrial Dysfunction",
                "Vitamin D levels, Hair growth cycles, and Bone density",
                "Bicep strength, Lung capacity, and Skin elasticity",
                "Dental health, Vision acuity, and Hearing threshold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'HPA-Immune-Mitochondrial' triad represents the core energetic and regulatory foundation; when all three collapse, the client enters a high-acuity state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "During the Integrative Strategy (I) phase for rapid symptom stabilization, what is the primary goal before attempting deep 'Root Cause' detoxification?",
            "options": [
                "To provoke a 'healing crisis' or Herxheimer reaction",
                "To lower the 'Total Allostatic Load' and improve the client's subjective quality of life immediately",
                "To sell as many supplements as possible in the first week",
                "To force the client into a 3-day water fast"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization (I) focuses on reducing allostatic load (stressors) to create the physiological 'margin' necessary for the body to handle more intensive root-cause work later."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "For homebound or frail clients (Lesson 5), 'Dynamic Lifestyle Modification' (D) emphasizes 'Micro-Interventions.' What is the typical duration recommended for these tasks?",
            "options": [
                "45-60 minutes of continuous effort",
                "2-5 minute manageable 'wins' that do not trigger an HPA-axis crash",
                "At least 2 hours of outdoor sunlight daily",
                "Micro-interventions are not recommended for the frail"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frail clients have very low 'adaptive reserves.' Micro-interventions (2-5 mins) provide the benefits of movement or mindfulness without overtaxing their fragile systems."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 (Guided Resilience), which technique is highlighted as a 'Gold Standard' for increasing Vagal Tone and resetting the Autonomic Nervous System?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Consuming high doses of caffeine",

                "Extended periods of sensory deprivation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonant frequency breathing has been shown in clinical studies to optimize Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and stimulate the Vagus nerve, facilitating a shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "During 'Enduring Wellness' (E), the 'Post-Crisis Reconstitution' phase (Lesson 7) warns against 'Premature Resumption.' What does this refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Starting a new hobby too soon",
                "Returning to high-stress work or intense exercise before the metabolic 'bank account' has been adequately refilled",
                "Eating solid food after a liquid diet",
                "Talking to family members about the crisis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many clients feel a 'false sense of energy' once stabilized and return to the stressors that caused the collapse, leading to a secondary (and often worse) relapse."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is a hallmark symptom of 'Vicarious Trauma' in a practitioner managing complex cases?",
            "options": [
                "Increased energy and excitement about work",
                "A shift in the practitioner's world-view, feeling that the world is inherently unsafe or that recovery is impossible",
                "Improved sleep quality",
                "Weight gain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious trauma involves a fundamental shift in the practitioner’s perspective and cognitive schema due to repeated exposure to the suffering and complexity of others."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Multi-System Collapse' including POTS-like symptoms, severe Mast Cell Activation (MCAS), and history of mold exposure. What is the first priority in the BRIDGE framework?",
            "options": [
                "Intense antifungal therapy to kill the mold",
                "Stabilization of the mast cells and nervous system to prevent further 'systemic flares'",
                "Genetic testing for MTHFR mutations",
                "Heavy metal chelation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, stabilization (I) must come before aggressive 'killing' or 'detox' (R) protocols, as the latter can cause a systemic collapse in an unstable client."

        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "Statistics cited in the module suggest that practitioners who do not utilize 'De-rolling' or 'Supervision' rituals have a ____ higher risk of burnout when handling high-acuity cases.",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10%",
                "Significantly higher (up to 40-60% in some clinical cohorts)",
                "Lower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-complexity work carries a significant emotional and cognitive load; without structured support and 'de-rolling,' burnout rates among integrative clinicians climb dramatically."
