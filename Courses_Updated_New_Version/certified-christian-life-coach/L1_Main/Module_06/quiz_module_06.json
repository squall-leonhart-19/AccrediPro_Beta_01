            "question": "In Lesson 1, the Greek word 'metamorphoo' is used to describe transformation. What is the primary characteristic of this type of change?",
            "options": [
                "A superficial change in appearance or behavior",
                "A fundamental change in nature and essence from the inside out",
                "A temporary emotional response to a sermon or event",
                "A social adaptation to fit into a church community"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metamorphoo (the root of 'metamorphosis') describes a radical change in form or nature, as seen in Romans 12:2, indicating that transformation is internal and essential, not just behavioral."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. This aligns with Romans 12:2, showing that we can literally 'rewire' our minds through the renewal of our thoughts."

                "By replacing all secular habits with religious ones immediately",
                "By only practicing habits when you feel a strong emotional 'prompt'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking involves identifying a current habit (the anchor) and 'stacking' a new behavior on top of it (e.g., 'After I pour my morning coffee, I will read one Psalm')."

                "A state of permanent stagnation where transformation has failed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Liminal space is the 'threshold' period of change. It is often uncomfortable and disorienting but is essential for deep, lasting transformation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biblically, strongholds are 'logismos' (arguments or reasonings) and 'pretensions' that set themselves up against the truth of God; they are mental fortresses that require spiritual weapons to dismantle."

                "Legalistic accountability is more effective for long-term transformation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Covenant accountability is a 'one-another' relationship based on biblical grace and the desire for the other person's highest good, whereas legalistic accountability focuses on rules and punishment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Graduation is about 'sending' the client out with the tools, habits, and spiritual reliance they need to continue growing independently of the coach."

            "question": "A client struggles with 'All-or-Nothing' thinking (e.g., 'If I miss one day of prayer, I've failed God entirely'). According to Lesson 2, this is an example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
