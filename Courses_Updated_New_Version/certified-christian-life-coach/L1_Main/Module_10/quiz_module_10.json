            "question": "In the context of 'The Neuroscience of Mind Renewal,' what biological process allows the brain to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, effectively facilitating the 'renewing of the mind' mentioned in Romans 12:2?",
            "options": [
                "Neural pruning",
                "Neuroplasticity",
                "Synaptic stasis",
                "Cortical inhibition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural pathways. In Christian coaching, this is the biological mechanism through which the Holy Spirit and intentional practice facilitate the 'renewing of the mind.'"

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Breaking Strongholds, what is the 'Cognitive-Behavioral Alignment' process primarily designed to do?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminate all negative emotions through positive thinking",
                "Identify and replace 'automatic thoughts' that contradict biblical truth",
                "Force behavior change through strict accountability and punishment",
                "Focus exclusively on external habits without addressing internal beliefs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive-Behavioral Alignment involves identifying 'strongholds' (cognitive distortions) and replacing them with biblical truth to ensure that internal beliefs and external behaviors are congruent."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In Bridges' Transition Model discussed in Lesson 4, what characterizes the 'Neutral Zone'?",
            "options": [
                "A state of high energy and immediate success in a new venture",
                "The initial stage of letting go of the old identity",
                "A period of uncertainty, confusion, and 'in-betweenness' where real transformation occurs",
                "The final stage where a client feels fully integrated into their new reality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Zone is the middle stage of transition where the old is gone but the new isn't fully operational. It is often uncomfortable but is the critical space for psychological and spiritual realignment."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Lesson 3 emphasizes that for spiritual disciplines to create sustainable change, they must move from 'discipline' to 'desire.' What is the most effective way to facilitate this shift in a client?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the frequency of the discipline until it becomes a chore",
                "Focusing on the legalistic requirement of the discipline",
                "Connecting the discipline to the client's core identity in Christ and their love for Him",
                "Removing all structure and relying solely on spontaneous feelings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable change occurs when spiritual disciplines are viewed as a means of relational intimacy with Christ rather than just a checklist, moving the motivation from external 'ought' to internal 'want.'"

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "When applying 'Advanced Goal Setting' (Lesson 5), what is the fundamental difference between 'Stewardship' and 'Ownership' of a vision?",
            "options": [
                "Ownership is biblical; stewardship is a secular management term",
                "Stewardship recognizes God as the source and owner, while the coach/client are managers of His resources",
                "Ownership leads to less stress because the client is in total control",
                "Stewardship implies that the client has no responsibility for the outcome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stewardship acknowledges that God owns the vision and the resources, and the client's role is to faithfully manage what has been entrusted to them. This reduces 'performance anxiety' and aligns the goal with God's purposes."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Conflict Resolution, what is the 'Gospel-Centered' distinction between Forgiveness and Reconciliation?",

                "They are the same thing and must always happen simultaneously",
                "Forgiveness is a bilateral agreement; reconciliation is a unilateral choice",
                "Forgiveness is a unilateral release of debt; reconciliation is the bilateral restoration of trust",
                "Reconciliation is required by God, but forgiveness is optional based on the offender's apology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Forgiveness is something a person can do alone as an act of obedience to God. Reconciliation, however, requires both parties to work toward restoring trust and the relationship."

                "The total amount of money given to missions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Qualitative metrics focus on the nature and quality of transformation, such as the internal shift toward peace, joy, or patience, which are harder to count but more indicative of heart change."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 8, how does a 'Redemptive Growth Mindset' differ from a standard secular growth mindset?",
            "options": [
                "It relies solely on human effort and willpower to improve",
                "It views failure as an end-point rather than a learning opportunity",
                "It sees challenges as opportunities for God's grace to be perfected in our weakness (2 Cor 12:9)",
                "It ignores personal weaknesses and only focuses on strengths"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Redemptive Growth Mindset integrates the biblical truth that our growth is fueled by God's grace and that our failures are not final but are 'setups' for God's restorative work."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A client reacts with intense fear and defensiveness when challenged about a goal. According to the neuroscience of transformation (Lesson 1), which part of the brain has likely 'hijacked' their processing?",
            "options": [
                "Prefrontal Cortex",
                "Amygdala",
                "Hippocampus",
                "Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala is the brain's 'alarm system.' When a client feels threatened (even by a goal or change), the amygdala can trigger a fight-or-flight response, bypassing the logical Prefrontal Cortex."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "When managing resistance during transformation (Lesson 4), what is the most effective coaching 'intervention' for a client stuck in homeostasis (the desire to stay the same)?",
            "options": [
                "Increased pressure and shame to force them forward",
                "Validating the fear of the unknown while reconnecting them to the 'Why' of their vision",
                "Ending the coaching relationship immediately because they aren't ready",
                "Ignoring the resistance and moving to the next module"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance is a natural part of the transition. A coach should acknowledge the difficulty of change (validating the fear) while helping the client anchor back into their God-given purpose (the 'Why') to overcome the pull of homeostasis."
