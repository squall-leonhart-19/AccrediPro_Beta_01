            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "According to the neurobiological principle of 'Hebb’s Law' discussed in Lesson 1, how does the brain facilitate the 'renewal of the mind'?",
            "options": [
                "The brain physically deletes old memories to make room for new biblical truths.",
                "Neurons that fire together, wire together, meaning repeated thought patterns create physical neural pathways.",
                "Transformation occurs only in the amygdala, bypassing the prefrontal cortex entirely.",
                "Neuroplasticity stops after age 25, requiring purely supernatural intervention for change."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hebb's Law states that 'neurons that fire together, wire together.' In a coaching context, this means that consistently practicing biblical thought patterns creates physical, structural changes in the brain (neuroplasticity)."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In the 'Replacement Principle' (Lesson 2), why is it insufficient to simply 'stop' a negative behavior or lie without a corresponding truth?",
            "options": [
                "Because nature and the spirit abhor a vacuum; an empty space invites the old lie to return with more force.",
                "Because the client will lose motivation if they don't have a reward.",
                "Because the prefrontal cortex cannot process 'negative' commands like 'don't.'",
                "Because the coach needs more billable hours to work on the replacement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Based on the principle in Matthew 12:43-45, an 'empty house' is vulnerable. True transformation requires displacing a lie with a specific, biblical truth to fill the cognitive and spiritual space."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "When applying 'Habit Formation as Spiritual Discipline' (Lesson 3), what is the primary role of a 'Micro-Habit'?",
            "options": [
                "To achieve the entire goal in the first week of coaching.",
                "To bypass the brain's resistance to change by making the task 'too small to fail.'",
                "To ensure the client spends at least 60 minutes on the new discipline daily.",
                "To replace the need for Holy Spirit empowerment with human willpower."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-habits (like praying for 1 minute) reduce the 'activation energy' required and bypass the amygdala's fear response, allowing the client to build the 'identity' of someone who performs that discipline."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 distinguishes between psychological resistance and spiritual warfare. Which of the following is a hallmark of 'spiritual warfare' in a coaching session?",
            "options": [
                "The client is simply tired and needs better sleep hygiene.",
                "The client has a logical disagreement with the coach's strategy.",
                "A sudden, irrational intense opposition to a specific God-given identity or breakthrough.",
                "The client's personality type is naturally more skeptical and analytical."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spiritual warfare often manifests as sudden, irrational, or disproportionate opposition to specific spiritual breakthroughs or identity shifts that align with God's will, whereas resistance is often more systemic and logical."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Social Architecture' refers to the intentional curation of a client's inner circle. According to the research cited, how does a 'High-Proximity' social environment affect transformation?",
            "options": [
                "It has no measurable effect if the client has strong willpower.",
                "Clients are 50% more likely to fail if their primary social circle opposes their new habits.",
                "Social environments only matter for extroverted clients.",
                "We are the average of the five people we spend the most time with, necessitating 'Kingdom-aligned' community."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 emphasizes that environment often trumps willpower. Curating 'Social Architecture' ensures the client is surrounded by those who pull them toward their Kingdom identity rather than back to their old self."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "According to William Bridges' model in Lesson 6, what characterizes the 'Neutral Zone' of a transition?",
            "options": [
                "A period of high productivity and immediate clarity.",
                "The final stage where the client celebrates their new beginning.",
                "A chaotic 'wilderness' where the old is gone but the new has not yet fully emerged.",
                "The moment the client decides to sign a coaching contract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Zone is the uncomfortable middle phase of transition. It is a 'wilderness' experience where the client feels 'in-between,' which is often where the deepest spiritual formation occurs."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 introduces Kingdom Performance Indicators (KPIs). Which of the following is a 'Qualitative Kingdom KPI'?",

                "The total number of hours spent in the gym."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While quantitative metrics (like chapters read) are useful, Kingdom KPIs focus on the 'fruit' of the transformation, such as the internal shift in peace, joy, and spiritual authority."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the C.H.R.I.S.T. Lifecycle (Lesson 8), what does the 'S' stand for in the context of sustaining growth?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stewardship in the C.H.R.I.S.T. Lifecycle refers to the client’s responsibility to manage their renewed mind, their energy, and their environment to sustain the growth achieved during coaching."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client feels 'stuck' and discouraged because they had a relapse into an old habit after three weeks of success. Based on Lesson 3, how should the coach respond?",
            "options": [
                "Remind them that they have failed and need to restart the 66-day cycle from zero.",
                "Focus on 'Identity over Intensity,' helping them see that one lapse doesn't negate their new identity as a child of God.",
                "Increase the difficulty of the habit to 'punish' the lapse.",
                "Advise the client that they might not be ready for coaching at this time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable growth focuses on identity. A lapse is a data point, not a destination. The coach helps the client return to their 'Kingdom identity' and analyze the 'cue' that led to the lapse."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Research by Phillippa Lally (referenced in the module) suggests that on average, it takes how many days for a new behavior to become automatic?",

                "21 days",
                "7 days",

                "365 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the '21-day myth' is common, Lally's research shows an average of 66 days for a habit to reach peak automaticity, emphasizing the need for long-term coaching support and 'Sustainable Growth' strategies."
