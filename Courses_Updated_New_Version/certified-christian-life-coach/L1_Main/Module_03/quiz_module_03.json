            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While secular coaching seeks 'Aha!' moments from human logic, Christian coaching seeks Revelation—the divine uncovering of God’s truth and perspective through the Holy Spirit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The term 'Paracletos' (John 14:16, 26) identifies the Holy Spirit as one who is called alongside to help, counsel, and advocate, serving as the primary guide in the coaching process."
