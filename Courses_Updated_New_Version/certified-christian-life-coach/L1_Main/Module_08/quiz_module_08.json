            "question": "During a session, a client identifies a goal but feels an 'internal block' preventing them from acting. According to the C.H.R.I.S.T. flow, which pillar should the coach prioritize?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 21 days can start a habit, research in Christian neurobiology suggests 63 days (3 cycles) are needed for a new 'truth-based' thought pattern to become the brain's default 'long-term' pathway."
