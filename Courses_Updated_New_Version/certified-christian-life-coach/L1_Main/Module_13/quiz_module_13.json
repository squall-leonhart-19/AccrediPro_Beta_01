            "question": "In the context of the 'Theology of Change,' how is the process of sanctification best described for a coaching client?",
            "options": [
                "A monergistic process where the client remains passive while God changes them",
                "A synergistic process where God's grace provides the power and the client provides the participation",
                "A legalistic process focused primarily on the modification of external behaviors",
                "A self-actualization process where the client discovers their own inner divinity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sanctification in Christian coaching is viewed as synergistic; while God provides the transformative power (Philippians 2:13), the client is called to active participation and obedience (Philippians 2:12)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on 2 Corinthians 10:4-5, a stronghold is a mental fortress built of arguments and pretensions that set themselves up against the truth of God."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "When practicing 'Prophetic Listening' (Lesson 3), the coach distinguishes between 'Logos' and 'Rhema.' What does 'Rhema' refer to in a coaching session?",
            "options": [
                "An inspired, specific word from God for the client's current situation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While 'Logos' is the written Word of God, 'Rhema' refers to a specific, 'now' word or utterance from the Spirit that brings clarity to a client's specific moment."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client constantly says, 'I feel like a failure, so I must be failing in God's eyes.' This indicates a need for 'Identity Anchoring.' What is the core shift needed here?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity Anchoring teaches clients that their position in Christ (righteous, accepted) is a fixed reality that is not determined by their fluctuating emotional experiences or performance."

                "It takes a minimum of 10 years to change deep-seated cognitive patterns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module references the standard neuroplasticity cycle, noting that while initial pathways form in 21 days, the 'stewardship' of the mind requires a 63-day cycle for deep-seated cognitive renewal."

                "Decisional is for Christians; Emotional is for non-believers",
                "Decisional is a choice of the will to release the debt; Emotional is the gradual healing of the heart",
                "Emotional forgiveness must happen before a client can make a decision to forgive",
                "There is no distinction; they must happen simultaneously for breakthrough"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaching focuses on 'Decisional Forgiveness' as a starting point—a commitment to forgo revenge—which then creates the space for God to work on 'Emotional Forgiveness' over time."

                "A sign that the client is no longer called to their current ministry",
                "Always the result of a hidden demonic attack"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The lesson explores the 'Dark Night' (St. John of the Cross) as a season where God withdraws the 'sensible consolations' of faith to mature the client's love for Him beyond just 'feelings.'"

            "id": "q13_8",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 identifies Acedia as a specific type of spiritual resistance; the remedy is often 'Stability'—staying the course in one's vocation rather than fleeing the discomfort."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A case study in the module describes a high-performing executive who can't stop seeking approval. The coach uses 'Advanced Heart-Search' to find the root. What is the likely 'Hidden Stronghold'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Orphan Spirit' is a common stronghold identified in the module where a believer operates from a deficit of love, trying to achieve what they already possess through Christ."
