            "question": "According to the theology of 'Imago Dei' in Lesson 1, what is the fundamental basis for a client's intrinsic value?",
            "options": [
                "Their moral track record and spiritual maturity",
                "Their inherent status as a bearer of God's image, independent of performance",
                "The specific spiritual gifts they have been assigned",
                "The level of impact they have on their community"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Imago Dei teaches that human value is ontological—it is rooted in being created in the image of God, which remains intact regardless of performance or failure."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client states, 'I feel like God only loves me when I'm consistent in my prayer life and ministry work.' Which concept from Lesson 2 does this best illustrate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Doing to Be' trap is the false belief that our identity and acceptance are earned through performance rather than received through grace."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, what is the primary distinction between a 'Positional Reality' and an 'Experiential Reality'?",
            "options": [
                "Positional reality is based on feelings; experiential is based on scripture",
                "Positional reality changes daily; experiential reality is fixed",
                "Positional reality is the fixed truth of who we are 'In Christ'; experiential reality is how we feel or act in the moment",
                "There is no distinction; they are the same in Christian coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Positional reality refers to the objective, unchangeable status of the believer in Christ (e.g., justified, redeemed), while experiential reality refers to our subjective daily experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interrogation involves questioning the source of the label and comparing it against the 'Mirror of the Word' to see if it is a lie or a truth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": [
                "Talents are for secular work; gifts are only for use inside a church building",
                "Talents are present from birth; spiritual gifts are specifically empowered by the Holy Spirit for the edification of the Church",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms",
                "Talents are earned through practice; gifts require no effort to use"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both come from God, natural talents are part of our 'hard-wiring' from birth, whereas spiritual gifts are special empowerments given by the Spirit for the common good of the Body of Christ."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychological research consistently shows that for the average person, 75-80% of self-talk is negative or self-critical, highlighting the need for the 'Renewed Self-Image' through Scripture."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the 'Identity to Impact' bridge discussed in Lesson 8, why is identity considered the foundation of stewardship?",
            "options": [
                "Because we cannot manage what we do not first own as our identity",
                "Because people with high self-esteem work harder",
                "Because stewardship is a way to earn a better identity",
                "Because identity and stewardship are unrelated concepts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stewardship is the management of God's resources; we must first understand our identity as 'sons and daughters' and 'stewards' to effectively manage our time, talents, and influence."

                "He lacks sufficient natural talents",
                "He has confused his 'Functional Identity' (what he does) with his 'Core Identity' (who he is in Christ)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mark has built his identity on performance and roles (Functional Identity). When these don't satisfy, it indicates a need to reconnect with his Core Identity in Christ."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which Biblical metaphor from Lesson 7 is used to describe the process of identity transformation?",
