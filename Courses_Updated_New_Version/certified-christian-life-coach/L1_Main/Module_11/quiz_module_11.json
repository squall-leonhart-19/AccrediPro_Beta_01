            "question": "In the context of 'The Ontology of the New Creation' (L1), what is the primary distinction between an ontological change and a behavioral change?",
            "options": [
                "Ontological change is temporary, while behavioral change is permanent.",
                "Ontological change refers to a change in the essence of being, while behavioral change refers to outward actions.",
                "Ontological change is achieved through discipline, while behavioral change is a gift of grace.",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in Christian coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ontology is the study of being. In the New Creation (2 Cor 5:17), the believer undergoes a fundamental shift in their nature/essence (being), which then serves as the foundation for transformed behavior (doing)."

            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on the Neurobiology of Transformation, what process is responsible for 'insulating' new neural pathways, making the new identity-based thoughts faster and more automatic?",

                "Synaptic Pruning",
                "Amygdala Hijacking",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Myelination is the process of forming a myelin sheath around nerve fibers. As we repeat new, truth-based thoughts, myelination increases the speed and efficiency of those electrical impulses, making the new mindset 'stick.'"

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Lesson 2 defines an 'Identity Stronghold' based on 2 Corinthians 10:4-5. Which of the following best describes the 'weapons' used to pull these down?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The scripture specifies that our weapons are not of the flesh but have 'divine power' to destroy strongholds, specifically targeting 'arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God.'"

                "Exousia is delegated legal authority; Dunamis is inherent miraculous power.",
                "Exousia is only for pastors; Dunamis is for all believers.",
                "Exousia refers to the Old Testament; Dunamis refers to the New Testament."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exousia is the 'delegated right' or authority given to the believer because of their position in Christ, whereas Dunamis is the 'working power' or ability of the Holy Spirit."

                "To tell the client exactly who they are supposed to be based on the coach's intuition.",
                "To ignore the transition and focus strictly on productivity goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liminality is the 'threshold' between the 'no longer' and the 'not yet.' The coach facilitates the integration of the new identity during this sensitive period of flux."

                "Logos is Greek; Rhema is Hebrew.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While both are the Word of God, Logos is the inspired written record, and Rhema is the specific, 'quickened' word that brings personal revelation and initiates immediate transformation in the believer's identity."

            "question": "In 'Advanced Mind Renewal Strategies' (L7), the 'Replacement Principle' suggests that it is not enough to simply 'stop' a negative thought. What must happen instead?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mind renewal (metanoia) requires a 'displacement' of lies. When a stronghold is 'cast down,' a 'Rhema' truth must be planted in its place to occupy that mental territory."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'H' stands for 'Honor the Truth.' This involves the client making a volitional choice to align their speech and belief with God's Word, even when their emotions or current circumstances suggest otherwise."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in Lesson 3 regarding neuroplasticity suggests that deep-seated identity patterns (strongholds) typically require how many days of consistent 'truth-replacement' to reach long-term potentiation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 21 days is the 'threshold' for starting a habit, research into neuroplasticity (often highlighted by practitioners like Dr. Caroline Leaf) shows it takes roughly 63 days to fully dismantle and rebuild complex protein-based memory structures in the brain."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "David is operating out of a 'Performance-Based Identity,' where his worth is tied to his 'doing' rather than his 'being' in Christ. This is a classic identity stronghold that requires mind renewal."
