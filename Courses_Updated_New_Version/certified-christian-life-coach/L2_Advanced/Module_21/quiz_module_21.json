            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Nehemiah Principle, based on Nehemiah 2 and 4, emphasizes that spiritual leaders must pray as if everything depends on God and plan as if they have been given the stewardship of the outcome."

                "To eliminate the need for prayerful intuition during the coaching session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thematic coding allows the coach to see beyond isolated incidents to identify the 'root' issues—recurring themes of the heart that require targeted strategic intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Romans 12:2 calls for the 'renewal of the mind.' Cognitive reframing aligns with this by actively replacing lie-based neural pathways with truth-based ones."

                "To ensure the coach has less work to do during the week",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stewardship involves focusing limited time and energy on the high-leverage areas that produce the greatest spiritual transformation, rather than diluting effort across twenty minor goals."

                "Warfare often manifests as sudden, disproportionate, and externalized opposition that targets a specific spiritual breakthrough",
                "Psychological resistance only happens to non-Christians",
                "There is no difference; all obstacles should be treated as demonic in nature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While they often overlap, spiritual warfare is frequently characterized by its timing—occurring right before or after a major spiritual victory—and its intensity relative to the actual situation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lagging indicators are the 'harvest'—they show the result of growth over time. Leading indicators (like daily prayer) are the 'seeds' that eventually produce the lagging indicators (character change)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical synthesis requires recognizing the limits of life coaching; clinical pathology requires specialized therapeutic intervention beyond the scope of a growth-oriented coach."
