            "options": [
                "To help the client avoid taking responsibility for their past actions",
                "To separate the client's identity as a 'new creation' from the 'dominant story' of shame",
                "To identify which family member originally caused the shame",
                "To replace the Holy Spirit's conviction with psychological distance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalizing the problem allows the client to view the struggle as something they are facing rather than who they are, which aligns with the biblical truth of being a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The metaphor of the refiner's fire helps the client reframe suffering as a process of purification where the 'Refiner' (God) sits by the fire until He can see His own reflection in the metal."

                "It is a state of total shutdown used during the Dark Night of the Soul",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of Peace' suggests that the peace of Christ should 'rule' (Greek: brabeuo, meaning to act as an umpire) in our hearts to help discern the Spirit's direction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Righting Reflex' is the coach's urge to fix problems; in MI, the coach must resist this to allow the client to voice their own 'change talk' and spiritual motivations."

                "Ignore the physical sensation and focus on the logic of the decision",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity confirms that repetitive focus on biblical truth ('meditating day and night') creates new, dominant neural pathways, effectively rewriting the soul's script at a biological level."
