            "question": "In Lesson 1, what is the primary clinical differentiator between 'Clinical Depression' and the 'Dark Night of the Soul' as described by St. John of the Cross?",
            "options": [
                "Depression involves a loss of interest in all activities (anhedonia), while the Dark Night is characterized by a persistent, painful longing for God despite a lack of 'feeling' His presence.",
                "The Dark Night only lasts for 40 days, whereas depression lasts for months.",
                "Depression is purely biological, while the Dark Night is purely a result of personal sin.",
                "There is no difference; they are two different names for the same psychological state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While depression often involves a general loss of pleasure (anhedonia), the 'Dark Night' is specifically a spiritual purgation where the soul deeply desires God but feels distant from Him, often maintaining functionality in other life areas."

            "options": [
                "To confront the toxic individual with biblical 'truth-bombs' until they repent.",
                "To become as uninteresting and emotionally non-responsive as possible to decrease the 'supply' for the high-conflict individual.",
                "To build a wall of silence that lasts for at least six months.",
                "To mimic the toxic person's behavior to show them how it feels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Grey Rock' method involves becoming emotionally neutral and boring so that the high-conflict individual (who thrives on reaction) loses interest in the target."

            "explanation": "Based on 2 Corinthians 10:4-5, a stronghold is a cognitive and spiritual fortress—a belief system that resists the truth of God and keeps a client trapped in hopelessness."
