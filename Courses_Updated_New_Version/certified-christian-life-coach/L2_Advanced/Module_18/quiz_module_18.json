            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves fluidity, where the coach understands the method so deeply that they can navigate the phases non-linearly, following the Holy Spirit's leading while still maintaining the method's integrity."

                "A lack of theological education or scriptural knowledge."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A stronghold is a cognitive and spiritual 'fortress' built on lies that contradict God's Word, requiring more than just habit change—it requires 'unmasking' and spiritual 'pulling down.'"

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
