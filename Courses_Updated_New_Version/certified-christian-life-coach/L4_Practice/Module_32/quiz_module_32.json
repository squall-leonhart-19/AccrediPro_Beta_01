            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LLC (Limited Liability Company) protects personal assets from business liabilities while allowing the owner to control the mission and profit without the strict regulatory oversight and 'public benefit' requirements of a 501(c)(3) non-profit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
