            "id": "q30_1",
            "question": "A practitioner is operating in a jurisdiction where acupuncture is restricted to medical doctors, but traditional herbalism is unregulated. If the practitioner performs 'dry needling' under the guise of 'manual therapy,' what is the primary legal risk?",
            "options": [
                "Practicing medicine without a license",
                "Professional negligence",
                "Breach of informed consent",
                "Vicarious liability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Practicing techniques that fall under a restricted scope (like needling) without the specific license required by the state or region constitutes practicing medicine without a license, regardless of the terminology used."

            "id": "q30_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Five Elements' clinical design principles discussed in Lesson 2, which element should be emphasized in the reception area to promote a sense of 'grounding' and stability for arriving patients?",
            "options": [

                "Metal (White walls and minimalist metallic fixtures)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Earth element represents the center, stability, and grounding. Using square shapes and earthy tones in the reception area helps transition the patient from the 'chaotic' external world to a stable healing environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'thunderclap' headache is a classic red flag for potentially fatal neurological events like a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Immediate emergency referral is the only ethically and legally sound action."

            "question": "A practitioner's fixed monthly costs (rent, insurance, software) total $3,200. If the average revenue per treatment is $120 and the variable cost per treatment (supplies, herbs) is $40, how many treatments must be performed monthly to reach the break-even point?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Break-even = Fixed Costs / (Revenue per unit - Variable cost per unit). $3,200 / ($120 - $40) = $3,200 / $80 = 40 treatments."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While cameras allow for observation (tongue/face) and microphones allow for listening, the physical palpation of the pulse and channels (Qie) cannot be performed remotely, requiring practitioners to rely more heavily on the other three pillars."

                "It is a flat rate required by insurance companies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the transformation or 'result' the patient receives (e.g., being pain-free or resolving infertility) rather than just the time spent or the cost of the needles used."

            "id": "q30_10",
