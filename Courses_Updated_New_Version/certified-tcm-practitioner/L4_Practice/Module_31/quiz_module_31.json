                "Advertising a list of every single condition TCM can treat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Premium branding relies on differentiation through specialized expertise and a proprietary framework (Methodology) rather than competing on price, which leads to 'commoditization' where clients choose based only on cost."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regulatory bodies like the FTC and FDA prohibit 'disease claims' (cure, treat, mitigate) for non-drug products/services. 'Structure-function' claims that describe supporting the body's natural processes are generally compliant."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most prospects require multiple 'touchpoints' before booking. Retargeting keeps your brand top-of-mind for people who have already shown interest, leading to much higher conversion rates than 'cold' traffic."
