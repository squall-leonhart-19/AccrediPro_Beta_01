                "Treating 'Wei Bing'—the disease that has not yet occurred through preventive cultivation.",
                "Using high-potency herbal formulas to reverse chronic organ failure.",
                "Aggressive detoxification protocols to remove environmental 'Gu' toxins.",
                "Prioritizing physical strength and muscular hypertrophy over internal Qi flow."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Yang Sheng focuses on 'treating the not-yet-ill,' emphasizing lifestyle, diet, and emotional regulation to maintain harmony and prevent disease before it manifests."

            "question": "According to the TCM Organ Clock, a client who consistently experiences a 'slump' in energy and brain fog between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM is likely showing dysfunction in which organ system?",
            "options": [
                "The Heart (Xin), which governs the Blood and Shen.",
                "The Spleen (Pi), which is responsible for transformation and transportation of nutrients.",
                "The Large Intestine (Da Chang), which governs elimination.",
                "The Kidney (Shen), which houses the Yuan Qi."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "9:00 AM to 11:00 AM is the peak time for the Spleen. Dysfunction during this window often manifests as fatigue, poor concentration, or digestive heaviness."

            "question": "A client presents with 'Liver Fire Rising' symptoms, including irritability and headaches. They report waking up every night between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM. What is the clinical significance of this timing?",
            "options": [
                "It is the peak time for the Lungs, suggesting a grief-related respiratory issue.",
                "It is the peak time for the Triple Burner, suggesting a fluid metabolism problem.",
                "It is the peak time for the Liver, where Blood should be returning to the organ for detoxification and storage.",
                "It is the peak time for the Small Intestine, suggesting poor nutrient absorption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Liver's peak time is 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM. Waking during this time often indicates that the Liver is unable to effectively store Blood or anchor the Hun (Ethereal Soul) due to Heat or Stagnation."

                "Wake up very early at sunrise to maximize Yang energy exposure.",
                "Consume cooling raw salads to balance the internal heat from indoor heating.",
                "Prioritize 'early to bed and late to rise,' waiting for the sun to emerge before active movement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Winter is the most Yin season. TCM recommends conserving Jing by sleeping longer, reducing intense sweating (which opens pores to cold), and following the 'early to bed, late to rise' rule."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which of the 'Seven Emotions' is described in the Nei Jing as 'causing the Qi to scatter,' leading to symptoms like palpitations, insomnia, and lack of focus?",

                "Fear (Kong)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While joy is positive, 'Excessive Joy' (over-excitation) scatters the Heart Qi, preventing the Shen from being properly housed, which leads to restlessness and palpitations."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "For a client suffering from chronic insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep and a 'racing mind,' which physiological relationship is the TCM practitioner primarily trying to restore?",

                "The Spleen's ability to hold the Blood within the vessels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep is a function of Yin and Blood. If Blood is deficient, it cannot 'anchor' the Shen (Heart) or Hun (Liver), causing the spirit to float, resulting in insomnia and vivid dreaming."

            "question": "Wei Qi (Defensive Qi) is the body's first line of defense against 'The Spearhead of 100 Diseases.' What is this external pathogen, and which organ primarily circulates Wei Qi?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wind is considered the 'Spearhead of 100 Diseases' because it carries other pathogens (Cold, Heat, Damp) into the body. The Lungs are responsible for diffusing Wei Qi to the skin's surface."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In the practice of Qi Gong and Tai Chi, the 'San Tiao' (Three Regulations) refer to the harmonization of which three elements?",

                "Never exceed 70% of their maximum effort in exercise to avoid depleting Yuan Qi.",
                "Ensure 70% of their diet consists of raw, uncooked vegetables."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 70% Rule in Yang Sheng movement teaches that one should always keep 30% of their energy in reserve. Over-exertion (100% effort) 'borrows' from the Kidney Jing, leading to long-term depletion."

            "question": "A client works in a heavily air-conditioned office and frequently develops stiff necks and 'summer colds.' Which environmental equilibrium advice is most specific to TCM protection of Wei Qi?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The back of the neck contains 'Wind' points (Feng Fu, Feng Chi) where external pathogens easily enter. Protecting this area from drafts/AC is a core tenet of environmental equilibrium."
