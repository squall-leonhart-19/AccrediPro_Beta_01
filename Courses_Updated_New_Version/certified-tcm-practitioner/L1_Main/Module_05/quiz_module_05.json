            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Night sweats and a peeled tongue (no coating) are hallmark signs of Yin Deficiency. Yin tonics are required to nourish the 'water' and cool the 'empty fire' resulting from lack of substance."

                "They must be soaked in alcohol for 24 hours before any heat is applied."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "Nourishing herbs are too expensive to use early in treatment.",
                "Nourishing herbs are often 'cloying' and can trap existing pathogens or stagnation if not cleared first.",
                "Clearing herbs actually contain more Jing than nourishing herbs.",
                "The B.A.L.A.N.C.E. workflow is alphabetical and has no clinical significance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tonics can 'grease the wheel' of stagnation. If a client has Dampness or Heat, adding heavy tonics can worsen the condition by 'locking' the pathogen inside the body."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "When tonifying Yang, why do practitioners often include a small amount of Yin-nourishing herbs (the 'Zuo' or assistant herbs)?",
            "options": [
                "To make the formula taste better.",
                "To 'seek Yang within Yin,' ensuring the fire has fuel to burn and preventing dryness.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Based on the principle of 'seeking Yang within Yin,' adding Yin tonics provides the material substrate (fuel) for the Yang (fire) to manifest without causing Yin-depleting dryness."
