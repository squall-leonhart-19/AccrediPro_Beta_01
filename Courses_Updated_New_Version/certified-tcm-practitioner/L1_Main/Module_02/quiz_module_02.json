            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bian Zheng is the core diagnostic process in TCM where signs and symptoms are synthesized into a 'syndrome' or 'pattern' to guide treatment."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A patient presents with a sudden onset of aversion to cold, fever, a floating pulse, and a thin white tongue coating. Which 'Depth and Location' principle does this represent?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exterior patterns are characterized by sudden onset, aversion to cold/wind, and a floating pulse, indicating the pathogen is still at the superficial level of the body."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empty Heat arises from Yin deficiency; it typically manifests as low-grade fever, malar flush, night sweats, and 'five-center heat' rather than high, systemic fever."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deficiency (Xu) is characterized by a lack of vital substances (Qi, Blood, Yin, or Yang), resulting in weak pulses, pale tongues, and low energy levels."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Abdominal fullness (Interior), red tongue/yellow coating (Heat), and a greasy coating/slippery pulse (Excess/Dampness) combine to form an Interior-Heat-Excess pattern."
