            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "explanation": "The Wiry (Xian) pulse is the classic indicator of Liver involvement and Qi stagnation, reflecting the 'tension' within the system."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "While performing Meridian Palpation along the Spleen channel, you find a small, hard, and painful nodule. According to Lesson 4, what does this 'Ashi' point typically represent?",

                "A normal anatomical variation with no clinical significance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Local nodules, tenderness, or temperature changes discovered during palpation are physical manifestations of channel blockages where Qi and Blood are not flowing freely."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a heavy sensation in the limbs, a 'foggy' head, and a thick, greasy tongue coating. Which type of stagnation does this 'heavy and sticky' profile suggest?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q3_7",

            "options": [
                "Tonifying in the presence of stagnation can 'trap' the pathogen and worsen the blockage",
                "Tonification is only used for acute infectious diseases",
                "Stagnation always disappears on its own once the client rests",
                "TCM practitioners are legally required to clear stagnation first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A core principle in TCM is that tonifying (adding energy/substance) while a blockage exists can 'fuel the fire' or 'trap the thief,' leading to increased pain or discomfort."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client reports chronic ribcage tension and frequent sighing. She notes that her symptoms began after a period of intense emotional frustration at work. Which organ system is primarily responsible for this 'free flow' of Qi?",

                "The Heart",
                "The Lungs",

                "The Kidneys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Liver is the 'Master of Free Flow.' When its function is impaired by stress or emotion, Qi stagnates, leading to sighing and hypochondriac (rib) distention."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Invisible Phlegm' as discussed in Lesson 6?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visible phlegm is coughed up; 'Invisible Phlegm' refers to the TCM concept where phlegm obstructs the channels or orifices, causing symptoms like dizziness, severe numbness, or mental clouding."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing a 'Stagnation Map' for a client with multiple symptoms, which finding would take the highest priority for immediate clearing based on the clinical guidelines in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "Mild occasional bloating",
                "Acute, fixed stabbing pain from a recent injury (Blood Stasis)",
                "A slightly pale tongue",
                "A desire for warm drinks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acute Blood Stasis (fixed stabbing pain) is a high-priority stagnation because it physically obstructs circulation and can lead to more severe tissue damage if not addressed promptly."
