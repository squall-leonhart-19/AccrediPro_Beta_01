            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Method™, what is the primary distinction of the 'E' (Equilibrium) phase compared to the 'B' (Baseline) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Baseline is about diagnostic data, while Equilibrium is about maintaining dynamic homeostasis and long-term adaptability.",
                "Baseline focuses on the Liver, while Equilibrium focuses exclusively on the Kidney Jing.",
                "Equilibrium is a static state of health that requires no further intervention once reached.",
                "Equilibrium refers only to the physical alignment of the musculoskeletal system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While Baseline (B) establishes the starting point of the patient's constitution and current pathology, Equilibrium (E) represents the stage of sustainable health, focusing on the patient's ability to adapt to internal and external stressors (dynamic homeostasis)."

                "Conserving Kidney Yang through heavy, warming stews and minimal movement.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Jingzhe marks the time when hibernating insects 'awaken' and Yang energy begins to surge. Clinically, this requires supporting the Liver's natural tendency to expand to prevent irritability and stagnation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that mindful movement like Tai Chi reduces systolic blood pressure by regulating the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and reducing cortisol levels."

                "It is considered a 'Nutritional Excess' because it slows down the metabolism.",
                "It acts as 'Damp-Heat' by trapping moisture inside the building."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AC creates an artificial environment of Cold and Wind. When individuals move from high outdoor heat (open pores) to cold AC, the 'Wind-Cold' can easily invade the Taiyang channel, leading to stiff necks and respiratory issues."
