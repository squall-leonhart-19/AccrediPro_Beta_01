            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. clinical reasoning framework, what does the 'L' represent and why is it critical for advanced practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "Localization of Pain; to identify the specific dermatome affected.",
                "Logic of Pattern; to synthesize disparate symptoms into a coherent TCM diagnostic pattern.",
                "Lymphatic Drainage; to ensure the movement of fluids during treatment.",
                "Lateral Assessment; to compare the left and right sides of the body for symmetry."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Logic of Pattern' is the core of clinical reasoning, moving beyond symptom-chasing to identify the underlying disharmony (e.g., Liver Qi Stagnation) that links all presenting signs."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "During an advanced visual assessment (L2), a practitioner observes a deep midline crack reaching the tip of the tongue with a red, peeled surface. This most likely indicates:",

                "Liver Blood Stasis in the Lower Jiao."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A crack reaching the tip (Heart area) combined with a red, peeled (Yin deficient) surface suggests Heart Fire often stemming from or affecting Kidney Yin (the Water-Fire axis)."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Complex Patterns' (L3), how is 'True Cold, False Heat' (Yin Sheng Ge Yang) clinically differentiated from 'True Heat'?",

                "The patient has a rapid, forceful pulse and a bright red face.",
                "The patient has a red face but prefers hot drinks and has cold lower extremities.",
                "The patient exhibits a high fever and a preference for cold water.",
                "The patient has a yellow, greasy tongue coating and dark urine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True Cold, False Heat presents with 'floating' heat signs (red face) while the internal condition is Cold (cold limbs, desire for warmth, pale tongue)."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "When performing Meridian Mapping (L4), a 'cord-like' or 'wiriness' felt upon palpating the Gallbladder meridian (specifically GB34 to GB40) is most indicative of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Palpable tension or 'wiriness' along the GB meridian is a classic sign of Qi stagnation or physical tension within the Liver/Gallbladder system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "According to Inter-Organ Dynamics (L5), if a patient presents with 'Earth failing to nourish Metal,' which clinical manifestation is expected?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the Generating Cycle, Spleen (Earth) is the 'Mother' of Lung (Metal). If the Spleen is weak, it fails to nourish the Lung, leading to respiratory issues and phlegm production."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "When 'Nourishing the Essence' (L6), why is the restoration of Blood considered a prerequisite for stabilizing Yin?",

                "Blood is the 'mother' of Qi and moves the Yin.",
                "Blood and Yin share a common source; Blood provides the material substrate for Yin fluids.",
                "Blood is Yang in nature and balances the Yin.",
                "Blood restoration is only necessary in cases of external trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blood and Yin are closely related; chronic Blood deficiency often leads to Yin deficiency. Restoring the 'liquid' aspect of Blood helps anchor and replenish the body's Yin reserves."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Four Gates (LI4 and LV3) is the primary combination used to open the meridians, soothe the Liver, and circulate Qi throughout the entire body."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spring is associated with the Wood element and the Liver, which prefers 'free coursing.' Expansive, smooth movements help the Qi rise and expand naturally with the season."

            "question": "Case Study: A 52-year-old male presents with tinnitus (low pitch), knee weakness, and night sweats. His pulse is thin and rapid. According to the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. framework, what is the 'Action' (A) step?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The symptoms (low tinnitus, knee weakness, night sweats) and pulse (thin/rapid) clearly point to Kidney Yin Deficiency with Empty Heat."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis on acupuncture for chronic stagnation (referenced in L7) suggests that point stimulation has the highest efficacy when:",

                "Points are chosen randomly to 'surprise' the nervous system.",
                "Stimulation is maintained for exactly 5 minutes regardless of the condition.",
                "De-Qi sensation is obtained, indicating the arrival of Qi at the needle.",
                "Only distal points are used without any local points."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical research consistently shows that the 'De-Qi' sensation (aching, heaviness, or tingling) is a key predictor of therapeutic outcome in TCM needle stimulation."
