            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trigger points are hyperirritable spots in taut bands of muscle. Motor points are the most electrically excitable locations on a muscle, typically where the motor nerve innervates the muscle, often used to 'reset' muscle tone."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Hun is responsible for dreaming, vision, and planning. When the Liver Blood or Yin is deficient, the Hun 'wanders' at night, causing vivid dreams and a lack of purpose or direction."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
