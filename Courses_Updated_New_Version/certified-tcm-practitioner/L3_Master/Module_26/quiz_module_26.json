            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Advanced TCM Programs' (L1), what is the primary clinical risk of using an 'A-la-carte' treatment model instead of a structured program?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of herbal side effects due to lack of supervision.",
                "Fragmented care that focuses on symptomatic 'branch' relief rather than 'root' resolution.",
                "Lower profit margins for the practitioner despite higher patient volume.",
                "Inability to use advanced acupuncture techniques like 'Cooling the Heavens'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A-la-carte models often lead to 'symptom chasing' where the practitioner addresses the most recent complaint (the branch) without the consistent, sequential focus required to resolve the underlying pattern (the root)."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "According to the 12-Week Protocol (L2), what is the specific objective of 'Phase 2: Harmonization' (Weeks 5-8)?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive purgation of pathogenic factors and heat.",
                "Deep tonification of Kidney Jing to prevent future relapse.",
                "Balancing the Zang-Fu organs and regulating the flow of Qi and Blood after initial clearing.",
                "Initial intake and establishing the baseline diagnostic patterns."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 2 serves as the bridge between clearing (Phase 1) and tonifying (Phase 3), focusing on re-establishing functional balance and movement within the organ systems."

        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "When applying 'Strategic Sequencing' (L3), why must a practitioner resolve 'Damp-Heat' before administering heavy Yin tonics?",
            "options": [
                "Yin tonics are cloying and will 'trap' the Damp-Heat, leading to stagnation and worsening symptoms.",
                "Damp-Heat neutralizes the active alkaloids in Yin-tonifying herbs.",
                "Yin tonics increase the heart rate, which is contraindicated in Heat patterns.",
                "The patient's digestion is too weak to absorb Yin tonics during the first 12 weeks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In TCM sequencing, excess and stagnation must be cleared first. Tonifying in the presence of a pathogen (like Damp-Heat) 'traps the evil' inside, making the condition more difficult to treat."

            "id": "q26_4",

                "To rotate formulas to prevent 'herb resistance' in the gut microbiome.",
                "To adjust the formula based on the shift from 'Acute/Branch' focus to 'Chronic/Root' focus.",
                "To remove all 'Envoy' herbs to make the formula more potent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By week 4, the initial acute symptoms should be subsiding. The roadmap requires a shift in the herbal architecture to address the underlying constitutional deficiencies (the Root)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synergy involves using modalities that reinforce the same goal. Electro-acupuncture and heat provide the kinetic and thermal energy needed to break up deep Blood stagnation in the lower Jiao."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Earth element (Spleen/Stomach) is the center of transformation. During seasonal transitions, TCM periodization focuses on the 'Center' to ensure the body can adapt to the changing external environment."

                "The deadline for a practitioner to see a 100% resolution of symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Three-Week Wall' is a psychological hurdle where initial excitement fades and the reality of lifestyle changes or 'healing crises' (temporary aggravation) can lead to non-compliance."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "In 'Outcome Measurement' (L8), which of the following is defined as a 'Hard Metric' of clinical progress?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hard metrics in TCM are objective, observable changes. Tongue and pulse changes provide verifiable data that the internal landscape is shifting, regardless of subjective feelings."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A patient in Week 9 of a program (Tonification Phase) suddenly develops a 'Wind-Cold' invasion. According to 'Strategic Sequencing', what should the practitioner do?",
            "options": [
                "Continue with the Tonification herbs but double the dose to 'fight' the cold.",
                "Temporarily pause the Tonification roadmap and pivot to 'Releasing the Exterior' for 3-5 days.",
                "Ignore the Wind-Cold as it is only a 'Branch' issue and won't affect the 'Root' tonification.",
                "Immediately end the 12-week program and start a new 'Clearing' phase from Week 1."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical reasoning dictates that acute 'Exterior' invasions must be addressed immediately. You pause the 'Root' treatment (tonification) to clear the 'Branch' (the cold) to prevent the pathogen from being driven deeper by tonics."
