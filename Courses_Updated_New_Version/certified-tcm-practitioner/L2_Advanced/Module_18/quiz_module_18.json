            "question": "In Advanced Clinical Reasoning, when a patient presents with cold extremities but a red tongue with a dry yellow coat and a deep, forceful, rapid pulse, what is the synthesis of the Eight Principles?",
            "options": [
                "True Heat, False Cold",
                "True Cold, False Heat",

                "Spleen Yang Deficiency with Damp-Heat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "True Heat, False Cold (Yang Jue) occurs when internal heat is so intense it blocks Yang qi from reaching the extremities. The tongue and pulse reflect the true internal condition (Heat)."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "A patient presents with irritability, a bitter taste, and hypochondriac pain, alongside chronic loose stools and fatigue. Which Zang-Fu interplay is most likely?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of Wood (Liver) excess signs like irritability and pain with Earth (Spleen) deficiency signs like loose stools and fatigue indicates Wood overacting on Earth."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "When synthesizing diagnostics, if the Tongue is pale and swollen (suggesting Yang Deficiency) but the Pulse is rapid and thin (suggesting Yin Deficiency/Heat), how should the Master Clinician interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "The Pulse is always more accurate than the Tongue.",
                "The Tongue usually reflects the underlying constitution, while the Pulse reflects the immediate condition.",
                "The patient has a 'True Heat' condition only.",
                "The diagnostic tools are contradictory and cannot be used together."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In TCM synthesis, the tongue generally changes more slowly and reflects the 'Base' or 'Root' (Ben), while the pulse is more volatile and reflects the current 'Branch' (Biao) or immediate state."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "In a multimodal strategy for a patient with 'Phlegm-Heat Obstructing the Lungs' and 'Spleen Qi Deficiency,' what is the most effective sequence of intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Tonify Spleen Qi heavily with herbs first, then use acupuncture for Phlegm.",
                "Use acupuncture and herbs to clear Phlegm-Heat (Biao) first, then tonify the Spleen (Ben).",
                "Only use moxibustion to strengthen the Spleen.",
                "Avoid clearing heat as it might damage the Spleen Yang."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In acute-on-chronic cases, the 'Branch' (Phlegm-Heat) must be cleared first to prevent further obstruction before the 'Root' (Spleen Deficiency) can be effectively tonified."

        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "Which aspect of the Five Shen is primarily responsible for 'non-corporeal' movement, vision, and planning, and is often the root of psychosomatic 'stuckness'?",

                "The Yi (Spleen)",

                "The Zhi (Kidney)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hun (Ethereal Soul) resides in the Liver and governs planning, vision, and the 'movement' of the psyche. Obstruction here leads to a sense of being stuck or lack of direction."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "What clinical indicator is most suggestive of 'Invisible Phlegm' (Phlegm without form) in a chronic obstruction case?",
            "options": [
                "Productive cough with white sputum",
                "A greasy tongue coating and a slippery pulse without localized swelling",
                "Visible subcutaneous nodules",
                "Acute edema in the lower limbs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Invisible Phlegm does not manifest as physical discharge but is identified through systemic signs like a 'slippery' (Hua) pulse and a 'greasy' (Ni) tongue coat, often manifesting as dizziness or mental fog."

            "options": [
                "Jing tonics are too 'Yang' and will cause Heat.",
                "Jing tonics are 'cloying' and can further obstruct the Spleen's transformative function.",
                "Jing cannot be tonified if the Liver is stagnant.",
                "Tonics will drain the Shen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Jing-tonifying herbs are often rich and 'cloying' (greasy). If the Spleen is already weak or damp, these herbs cannot be digested and will worsen the stagnation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "The 'Master Clinician' approach to long-term management of chronic disease typically involves which strategy during the 'Consolidation Phase'?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the frequency of acupuncture to daily sessions.",

                "Using the strongest purgative herbs to ensure the pathogen is gone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term management requires tapering frequency while shifting the focus to the 'Root' (tonification and harmonization) to prevent relapse once the 'Branch' symptoms are controlled."

        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A patient with chronic Blood Stasis (Deep Stasis) and Phlegm presents with a fixed stabbing pain and a 'wiry-choppy' pulse. What is the priority in herbal formulation?",
            "options": [
                "Use only Blood tonics to nourish the vessels.",
                "Combine Blood-invigorating herbs with Phlegm-transforming herbs to 'open the orifices'.",
                "Use heavy minerals to sedate the Shen.",
                "Focus exclusively on Diuretics to drain dampness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic obstruction often involves 'Phlegm and Stasis' intertwined. Treatment must address both: moving the blood to stop pain and transforming phlegm to clear the channels."

            "id": "q18_10",
