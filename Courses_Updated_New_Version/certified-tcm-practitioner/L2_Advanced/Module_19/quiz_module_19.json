            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered the primary methodological challenge when applying the 'Gold Standard' Double-Blind RCT to acupuncture research?",
            "options": [
                "The high cost of acupuncture needles compared to pharmaceuticals",
                "The difficulty in designing a truly inert 'sham' acupuncture control that does not elicit a physiological response",
                "The lack of qualified practitioners willing to participate in clinical trials",
                "The inability to measure cortisol levels in patients receiving TCM treatments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sham acupuncture (needling non-points or shallow needling) often elicits a physiological response through 'diffuse noxious inhibitory control' (DNIC), making it difficult to establish a true placebo baseline."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Research into the neuro-endocrine link suggests that acupuncture modulates the HPA axis. What does 'HPA' stand for in this context?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is a major neuroendocrine system that controls reactions to stress and regulates many body processes, which acupuncture has been shown to modulate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synergy in TCM herbalism suggests that the complex mixture of compounds in a formula works on multiple targets simultaneously, often producing a greater effect than any single isolated active ingredient."

                "It is more reliable than Western blood pressure monitoring",
                "It often shows low to moderate inter-rater reliability (Kappa < 0.40), suggesting a need for standardized training and objective biosensors",
                "Pulse diagnosis has been proven to be entirely random and holds no clinical value"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies frequently show that different practitioners may interpret the same patient's pulse differently, highlighting the subjective nature of traditional diagnostics and the need for standardization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Modern hemorheology studies have correlated TCM Blood Stasis patterns with measurable changes in blood flow, including increased viscosity and microvascular 'sludging'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systems biology aligns with TCM's holistic view by looking at how treatments affect the body as an integrated network rather than focusing on a single 'lock-and-key' molecular mechanism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CER data often supports TCM as a viable, safe, and cost-effective alternative or adjunct to conventional pain management, particularly regarding the opioid crisis."
