            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Framework for complex cases, what does the 'L' specifically refer to in the clinical strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Linear Progression: Treating symptoms in the order they appeared",
                "Layering: Addressing the Biao (Branch) and Ben (Root) in a prioritized sequence",
                "Lateral Thinking: Incorporating Western diagnostic terminology exclusively",
                "Lifestyle Logic: Focusing only on diet before herbal intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Layering refers to the strategic prioritization of treatment, often addressing acute 'Branch' symptoms (like intense pain or inflammation) before or alongside the 'Root' (underlying deficiency) to ensure patient stability."

            "question": "In the case study regarding Autoimmune Dysregulation, why is the Metal-Wood axis critical to systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Metal (Lung) fails to descend Qi, causing Wood (Liver) to stagnate and generate Heat",
                "Metal (Lung) overacts on Wood (Liver), causing Blood Deficiency",
                "Wood (Liver) generates Earth (Spleen), leading to excess Dampness",
                "Metal (Lung) fails to regulate the 'cleansing' function of Wood, leading to Wei Qi rebellion against self-tissues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune cases, the Metal-Wood axis represents the relationship between the Lung (Wei Qi/Immunity) and Liver (Free flow of Qi/Blood). When Metal cannot regulate Wood, the immune response becomes erratic and 'rebellious.'"

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A patient presenting with advanced Shen Disturbance and 'Phlegm Misting the Heart' would most likely exhibit which clinical sign?",

                "Rapid, overflowing pulse and insomnia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phlegm Misting the Heart is characterized by 'obfuscation' of the Shen, leading to mental clouding, incoherent speech, and the hallmark greasy (damp-phlegm) tongue coating."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Chong Mai, known as the Sea of Blood, is the fundamental link between the Kidney Jing and the Uterus, regulating the menstrual cycle and hormonal balance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic syndrome typically involves a failure of the Spleen to transform and transport (T&T), leading to the accumulation of 'Turbidity' (Phlegm/Dampness) which obstructs metabolic pathways."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Post-Viral Syndromes are often classified as 'Gu Syndrome' (Latent Pathogens). Where is the pathogen said to be 'hidden' in these chronic cases?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Latent pathogens (Gu Syndrome) 'lurk' in the deep Yin or Blood levels, often depleting the Zheng Qi over time without showing typical acute exterior symptoms."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Neurological degeneration is fundamentally linked to 'Marrow Depletion.' Which organ's Essence (Jing) is responsible for filling the 'Sea of Marrow'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Kidneys store Essence (Jing), which produces Marrow. The Marrow then ascends to fill the Brain (the Sea of Marrow), making Kidney health vital for neurological integrity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Consolidation Phase occurs after the acute symptoms are managed; its goal is to build the body's reserves (Zheng Qi) to ensure the pathology does not return."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A case study involving 'Wood overacting on Earth' in a patient with Metabolic Syndrome would likely present with which digestive symptom?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wood (Liver) overacting on Earth (Spleen/Stomach) typically manifests as Qi stagnation symptoms (distension) that are exacerbated by emotional stress or anger."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Case Studies, why is 'Nuance' (the 'N' in BALANCE) emphasized?",
            "options": [
                "Because every patient must receive the same formula for 6 months",
                "To account for the unique constitutional variations that change how a 'textbook' pattern manifests",
                "To simplify the diagnosis into a single organ system",
                "To ensure the practitioner uses at least 20 different herbs per formula"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nuance is critical in advanced cases because complex patients rarely present as 'pure' textbook patterns; their unique constitution and history require tailored adjustments to treatment protocols."
