            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Inductive reasoning is the hallmark of TCM diagnosis, where a practitioner collects specific data points to form a cohesive pattern or 'Zheng' diagnosis."

            "options": [
                "When the condition is chronic and the patient is stable",
                "When the 'Branch' symptoms are acute, life-threatening, or causing unbearable pain",
                "Always, as the 'Branch' is what the patient complains about most",
                "Only during the maintenance phase of care"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard rule is: Treat the Ben in chronic cases, but treat the Biao in acute or emergency situations where the symptom (like hemorrhage or intense pain) poses an immediate threat."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Consolidation Phase occurs after acute symptoms have subsided; its goal is to strengthen the body's underlying physiology (the Root) to ensure the condition does not return."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Rule of Three is a monitoring benchmark. Lack of progress after three sessions indicates the initial diagnosis or treatment strategy may be incorrect and requires modification."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In TCM triage, an acute exterior invasion (Biao) is treated first to prevent the pathogen from sinking deeper, even if a chronic interior deficiency (Ben) exists."
