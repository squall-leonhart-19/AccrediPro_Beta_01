            "question": "A client presents with cold extremities and a preference for warm drinks, but also exhibits a red tongue tip, mouth sores, and extreme irritability. How should the practitioner prioritize treatment for this mixed Heat/Cold pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Focus exclusively on tonifying Yang to expel the cold extremities first.",
                "Clear Heart Fire while simultaneously warming the Kidney to address the 'Fire above, Water below' disharmony.",
                "Use only cooling herbs to ensure the Heart Fire does not damage the Yin further.",
                "Wait for the symptoms to consolidate into a single pattern before intervening."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In mixed patterns of 'Heat Above and Cold Below,' the practitioner must balance the formula to clear the interior heat (Heart) while warming the lower jiao (Kidney) to restore the Hyo-Kidney axis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical observations in autoimmune cases frequently show Wood (Liver/Immune reactivity) overacting on Earth (Spleen/Digestive barrier), leading to Leaky Gut and systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q17_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Syndrome involves a complex interplay of Spleen deficiency leading to Dampness, which congeals into Phlegm and eventually obstructs blood flow, causing Blood Stasis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Geriatric patients often have weak digestive fire; heavy tonics for Kidney Jing can cause 'cloying' (indigestion) unless the Spleen is protected and the formula includes digestive stimulants."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gu Syndrome refers to deep-seated, chronic pathogens (often post-viral or parasitic) that exhaust the body's foundational energy (Yuan Qi) and cause cognitive and systemic fatigue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Kidney-Heart-Uterus axis is the TCM framework for the HPO (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian) axis, showing how the Shen (Heart) and Jing (Kidney) regulate reproduction."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, clearing deep-seated pathogens can cause a temporary 'venting' or flare-up of symptoms as the body attempts to expel the toxin (often seen in Shao Yang level treatments)."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "What percentage of 'Long-COVID' or post-viral clients exhibit signs of 'Residual Heat' trapped in the Shao Yang (Half-Shao/Half-Tai) layer according to recent TCM clinical surveys?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that a significant majority (65-75%) of post-viral syndrome cases involve a 'lingering pathogen' trapped in the Shao Yang layer, requiring harmonization rather than just tonification."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term management requires a nuanced 'balancing of the scales,' adjusting the ratio of tonification to clearing based on the client's strength and the severity of the stagnation."
