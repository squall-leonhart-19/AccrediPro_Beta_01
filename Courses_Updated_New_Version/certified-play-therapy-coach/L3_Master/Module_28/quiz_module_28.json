            "question": "What is the primary objective of establishing the 'Ultra-Safe Container' during the initial phase of crisis stabilization?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately process the underlying trauma memories",
                "To achieve physiological and emotional regulation and safety",
                "To identify the perpetrator of the traumatic event",
                "To confront the child's maladaptive coping mechanisms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In crisis stabilization (L1), the immediate goal is 'safety first.' This involves regulating the nervous system and creating an environment where the child feels physically and emotionally secure before any deep trauma processing occurs."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "During a play-based risk assessment, which behavior is most indicative of high lethality risk rather than general distress?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressively throwing toys against the wall",
                "Burying all the figurines in the sand tray",
                "Concrete, repetitive enactment of a specific, lethal self-harm method",
                "Refusing to engage with the coach and sitting in the corner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While many behaviors show distress, L2 highlights that specific, repetitive enactments of lethal methods (e.g., hanging a doll or using a toy as a specific weapon on a self-representation) indicate a higher level of intent and risk."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "In the Phase-Oriented model for treating Complex PTSD (C-PTSD), what must occur before moving to Phase 2 (Trauma Processing)?",
            "options": [
                "The child must demonstrate consistent emotional regulation within their Window of Tolerance",
                "The child must be able to verbalize the entire trauma narrative",
                "At least six months of weekly sessions must have passed",
                "The child's caregivers must have completed their own individual therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L3 emphasizes that stabilization is the prerequisite for processing. Moving to trauma memory work before a child can regulate (stay within the Window of Tolerance) risks severe re-traumatization."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A child who has lost a parent consistently 'feeds' and 'talks' to a photo of that parent in the playroom. According to the 'Continuing Bonds' theory, the coach should:",
            "options": [
                "Gently remind the child that the parent is gone to encourage 'closure'",
                "Redirect the child to play with other children to promote socialization",
                "Support the play as a healthy way of maintaining a symbolic connection",
                "Diagnose the child with 'prolonged grief disorder' for failing to detach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modern bereavement theory (L4) moves away from 'closure' and instead supports 'Continuing Bonds,' where maintaining a healthy, symbolic relationship with the deceased is seen as adaptive and healing."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A foster child displays 'indiscriminate friendliness,' seeking intense physical affection from the coach during the first session. This survival strategy is often associated with:",
            "options": [

                "Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) from attachment trauma",

                "The 'Flight' response of the sympathetic nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L5, indiscriminate friendliness is a common adaptation in foster/adopted children with attachment trauma (DSED), where the child seeks safety from any available adult because they haven't had a consistent, secure base."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "How does 'Medical Play' help a child with a chronic illness integrate their experience?",
            "options": [
                "It distracts them from the pain of their treatments",
                "It allows them to shift from a passive victim to an active agent/master",
                "It teaches them the complex Latin terminology of their diagnosis",
                "It ensures they will never be afraid of a doctor again"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Medical trauma (L6) often stems from a loss of agency. By using medical tools in play to 'treat' dolls or the coach, the child regains a sense of control and mastery over the procedures that previously overwhelmed them."

                "Strong academic performance to please both parents",
                "The internal pressure to reject one parent to remain 'loyal' and safe with the other",
                "An indifference toward the conflict between parents"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L7 explains that in high-conflict scenarios, children often feel they must choose a 'side' to ensure their emotional survival, leading to the rejection of a 'target' parent to appease the 'favored' parent."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark symptom of Vicarious Trauma (VT) that distinguishes it from general Burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Feeling tired at the end of a long work week",
                "A shift in the coach's fundamental worldview and cognitive schemas",
                "Frustration with administrative paperwork and billing",
                "A desire to take a vacation or change career paths"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout is about exhaustion and workplace stress, Vicarious Trauma (L8) specifically involves changes in how the coach perceives the world (e.g., loss of trust, seeing the world as inherently dangerous) due to exposure to clients' trauma."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A child in the playroom is 'hyper-aroused,' breathing rapidly and throwing toys. According to the Window of Tolerance model, the coach's first priority should be:",
            "options": [
                "Asking the child to explain why they are angry",
                "Applying 'bottom-up' sensory regulation (e.g., heavy work or rhythmic movement)",
                "Setting a firm limit and ending the session immediately",
                "Interpreting the play as a reflection of the child's internal chaos"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a child is outside their Window of Tolerance (L1/L3), cognitive processing is 'offline.' The coach must use 'bottom-up' sensory interventions to bring the nervous system back into a regulated state before verbalizing or interpreting."

        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "When working with adoption dynamics, what does the 'Primal Wound' theory suggest?",
            "options": [
                "That the child will never be able to bond with adoptive parents",
                "That the initial separation from the biological mother is a foundational trauma",
                "That trauma only occurs if the adoptive family is abusive",
                "That the child's trauma is entirely genetic and cannot be helped by play"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L5 discusses the 'Primal Wound,' which posits that the severance of the biological bond is a significant trauma that exists regardless of how loving or 'perfect' the adoptive home is, requiring specific clinical sensitivity."
