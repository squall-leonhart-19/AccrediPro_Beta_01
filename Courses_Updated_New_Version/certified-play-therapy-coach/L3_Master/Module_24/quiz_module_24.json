            "id": "q24_1",
            "question": "Advanced clinical attunement relies heavily on the coach's ability to utilize 'Somatic Resonance.' This phenomenon is primarily driven by which neurological system?",
            "options": [
                "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS)",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic resonance is the physiological mirroring of a client's internal state, facilitated by mirror neurons which allow the coach to 'feel into' the client's experience."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "In the context of Complex Projective Techniques (Lesson 2), if a child consistently chooses the 'Sage' or 'Wise Old Owl' archetype during a period of family chaos, what is this most likely indicating?",
            "options": [
                "A desire for more academic pressure",
                "A defensive 'flight' into intellectualization or a search for internal stability/guidance",
                "Literal interest in ornithology",
                "A lack of imagination"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Archetypes serve as containers for the unconscious. Choosing a 'Sage' figure during chaos often represents a compensatory need for wisdom, order, or a protective internal guide."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When managing a 'High-Intensity Trauma Container' (Lesson 3), the technique of 'Pendulation' involves which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Swinging the child in a literal hammock to induce sleep",
                "Moving the child's attention back and forth between a place of safety and a place of traumatic activation",
                "Alternating between play therapy and talk therapy every 5 minutes",
                "Forcing the child to stay in the traumatic memory until they stop crying"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is a somatic experiencing technique used to help the nervous system discharge trauma by oscillating between resources (safety) and the traumatic 'vortex' (activation)."

        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory applications in the playroom (Lesson 4), a child who becomes 'still, pale, and disconnected' has likely entered which state?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic Adrenal (Fight or Flight)",

                "Hyper-Attuned State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the primitive 'immobilization' defense, characterized by shutdown, dissociation, and decreased heart rate/metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 emphasizes 'Bottom-Up' processing for kinesthetic breakthroughs. What is the core philosophy of this approach?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive reframing must happen before somatic movement",
                "The coach should sit on the floor while the child stands on a chair",
                "Sensory and motor experiences provide the foundation for emotional regulation and cognitive integration",
                "Playing only with toys located on the bottom shelf of the playroom"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing starts with the brainstem and limbic system (sensory/motor), recognizing that trauma is often stored in the body and cannot be 'talked' out of the prefrontal cortex initially."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Navigating Resistance,' a child who begins aggressively 'correcting' the coach's play style after a vulnerable moment is likely using which defense mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Identification with the aggressor is a defense where the child takes on the role of the person in control or the 'critic' to ward off feelings of vulnerability or helplessness."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Erotic Transference' in play coaching. What is the ethically sound response for a Master Practitioner when a child expresses 'love' or a desire to 'marry' the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Explain the legal definitions of marriage to the child",
                "Immediately terminate the session and refer out",
                "Maintain the 'Master's Container' by acknowledging the feeling as a symbol of safety/connection without shaming",
                "Tell the child that it is inappropriate and they are in trouble"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In play coaching, such expressions are usually 'positive transference' representing a deep sense of safety and attachment; the coach must hold this metaphorically and maintain professional boundaries."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'Vicarious Trauma in Play Practitioners' (referenced in Lesson 8) found that regular 'Interoceptive Self-Checking' reduced burnout scores by what percentage?",

                "10%",
                "22%",
                "44%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners who engage in high-level self-awareness and interoceptive checks (monitoring their own somatic responses) show significantly lower rates (approx. 44%) of vicarious trauma."

        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "During a high-intensity session, a child begins to 'throw' toys randomly. Using the Master Practitioner lens, the coach should first:",
            "options": [
                "Put the child in a time-out",
                "Assess the child's Neuroception—is this a Sympathetic discharge or a lack of safety?",
                "Immediately take all toys away",
                "Ask the child to explain the 'why' behind their anger"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Master Practitioner looks beyond the behavior to the nervous system state (Neuroception). Discharge of energy (Sympathetic) requires a different response than a child feeling unsafe and acting out defensively."
