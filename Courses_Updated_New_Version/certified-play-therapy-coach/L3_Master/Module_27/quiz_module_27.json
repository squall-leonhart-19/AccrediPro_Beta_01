            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proposed by Damian Milton, the Double Empathy Problem posits that communication breakdowns are a two-way street caused by different lived experiences and communication styles between neurodivergent and neurotypical people."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed coaching prioritizes 'bottom-up' regulation, which involves stabilizing the nervous system (brainstem/limbic system) through sensory and somatic play before attempting 'top-down' cognitive work."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Procedural play allows children to familiarize themselves with medical equipment and 'rehearse' procedures, shifting them from a passive victim of the illness to an active participant with a sense of mastery."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In group coaching, scapegoating is often a sign of group-level anxiety. Facilitating collaborative play helps shift the group's energy from exclusion to collective problem-solving."
