            "question": "In the 'Holistic Synthesis' stage of the S.P.A.R.K. Method™, how does the coach's application of the five pillars change compared to the foundational level?",
            "options": [
                "The pillars are followed in a strict, linear sequence from S to K.",
                "The coach moves fluidly between pillars, often addressing multiple domains (e.g., Regulation and Attachment) simultaneously based on real-time clinical cues.",
                "The coach focuses exclusively on the Kinesthetic pillar as it is the most advanced.",
                "The coach eliminates the Safety pillar to increase the challenge for the child."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level integration involves fluidity and the ability to synthesize the S.P.A.R.K. pillars non-linearly, responding intuitively to the child's immediate needs rather than following a rigid protocol."

            "question": "According to the research on rupture and repair (Schore, 2012), why is 'resistance' in the play room considered a clinical opportunity for a Master Coach?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to assert authority and set firmer boundaries.",
                "It indicates that the child is not ready for coaching and should be referred out.",
                "The process of repairing a rupture strengthens the therapeutic alliance and builds the child's relational resilience.",
                "It provides a break in the session for the coach to record data."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master coaches view resistance and ruptures as essential 'working moments' where the repair process models healthy conflict resolution and strengthens the attachment bond."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up integration starts with physiological sensations (Somatic) and moves toward naming and understanding (Cognitive), which is essential for trauma-informed play coaching."

            "question": "A coach is working with a neurodivergent child who exhibits sensory over-responsivity. Which adaptation to the S.P.A.R.K.™ environment demonstrates master-level competency?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the number of high-sensory toys to 'desensitize' the child.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master coaches adapt the environment to the child's neurobiology, utilizing low-arousal strategies and predictable routines to maintain a felt sense of safety for neurodivergent profiles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic counter-transference refers to the coach experiencing physical sensations in their own body that mirror or respond to the child's unconscious emotional state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The parallel process ensures that the coach's way of being with the parent (providing safety, regulation, etc.) is what the parent eventually provides for the child, creating systemic change."
