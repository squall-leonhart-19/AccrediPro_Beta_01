            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Respect in the S.P.A.R.K. Method™ centers on honoring the child's autonomy and self-expression, allowing them to lead the process while the coach maintains a safe environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While parents provide legal 'consent,' children provide developmental 'assent.' Ethically, a coach must seek the child's willing participation and respect their right to decline, even if the parent has consented."

            "explanation": "Cultural humility involves intentional inclusion. A playroom should reflect a diverse world so that every child can find representation in their play, regardless of the coach's personal background."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical documentation must be objective and behavioral. Stating exactly what the child did (throwing toys) is objective; labeling them 'angry' or 'a brat' is subjective and judgmental."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While parents have legal rights, the 'privacy of the playroom' is essential for the child's trust. Coaches should manage expectations during intake, explaining that they will share general themes but not verbatim disclosures unless safety is at risk."
