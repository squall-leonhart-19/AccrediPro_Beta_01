            "question": "In the case study regarding Complex Developmental Trauma (L1), what is the primary function of the 'Safety Container' before any trauma processing begins?",
            "options": [
                "To force the child to discuss the traumatic event in detail",
                "To establish a predictable environment that down-regulates the amygdala",
                "To provide a physical box where the child hides their toys",
                "To evaluate the child's cognitive ability to remember dates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Safety Container is designed to stabilize the nervous system and down-regulate the amygdala, ensuring the child feels physiologically safe before any cognitive or emotional processing of trauma occurs."

                "Time-outs in a brightly lit room",

                "Asking the child to write a list of their feelings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input (heavy work) provides 'bottom-up' regulation that helps organize the nervous system of neurodivergent children who are overstimulated."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the Bereavement and Loss case study (L3), why is 'Projective Play' using puppets or sand tray figures considered safer than direct talk therapy?",
            "options": [
                "It creates 'psychological distance' allowing the child to externalize the pain",
                "It is faster and allows the coach to skip the intake process",
                "Children are not capable of feeling real grief until age 12",
                "It prevents the child from using their imagination"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Projective play provides the necessary psychological distance for a child to explore overwhelming themes of death and loss without being directly re-traumatized by verbalizing them."

                "The physical distance between the play room and the waiting room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Attunement Bridge focuses on the synchronous micro-rhythms (eye contact, tone of voice, movement) that build a secure attachment bond between caregiver and child."

            "id": "q16_5",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatization occurs when emotional distress is stored in the body and expressed through physical symptoms (kinesthetic memory) because the child lacks the verbal tools to process the trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Re-enactment play allows a child who was a 'passive' recipient of medical procedures to take the 'active' role (e.g., being the doctor), which fosters a sense of agency and mastery over the trauma."

            "options": [
                "Knowledge; because the child must pass a written test",
                "Kindness; because the child must be nice to the coach",
                "Kinesthetic Integration; because it represents the embodiment of new behaviors",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Kinesthetic Integration is the final stage of the S.P.A.R.K. framework, representing the point where new emotional regulations and attachment patterns are fully embodied and integrated into the child's physical self."

            "options": [
                "Multi-directed partiality (remaining neutral and supportive of the child's system)",
                "Picking the 'better' parent and supporting them exclusively",
                "Telling the child exactly what their parents are doing wrong",
