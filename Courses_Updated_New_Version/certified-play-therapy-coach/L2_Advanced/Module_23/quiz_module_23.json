            "question": "In advanced sandtray mastery, what is the primary difference between a 'personal symbol' and a 'universal archetype'?",
            "options": [
                "A personal symbol has meaning across all cultures, while an archetype is unique to the child.",
                "An archetype represents shared human experiences (like the 'Hero' or 'Mother'), whereas a personal symbol derives meaning from the child's specific history.",
                "Personal symbols are only used by older children, while archetypes are used by toddlers.",
                "Archetypes must be explained verbally by the coach, while symbols are never discussed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Archetypes are universal patterns or images from the collective unconscious, while personal symbols are rooted in the individual's unique life experiences and associations."

            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory in play, which state is a coach attempting to facilitate when they use a soft melodic voice and 'expectant' facial expressions?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Arousal",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "Freeze Response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal system is the 'social engagement system.' Prosody (melodic voice) and warm facial expressions are 'cues of safety' that help move a child into this regulated state."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "When practicing Somatic Attunement, why might a coach 'micro-mirror' a child's breathing rate during a period of intense play?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the child from their emotional outbursts.",
                "To create a 'biological bridge' and activate mirror neurons, fostering deep empathy and felt safety.",
                "To show the child that their breathing is incorrect and needs to be slowed down.",
                "To prepare the child for a formal meditation exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-mirroring breathing and posture helps the coach attune to the child's internal state, creating a neurological connection through the mirror neuron system."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "In Narrative Play for complex trauma, what is the therapeutic purpose of 'Externalization' (e.g., naming a trauma 'The Dark Cloud')?",
            "options": [
                "To help the child pretend the trauma never happened.",
                "To separate the child's identity from the problem, reducing shame and allowing the child to 'act upon' the issue.",
                "To ensure the child knows the trauma was their fault.",
                "To make the therapy session feel more like a fictional storybook."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization separates the person from the problem. This 'de-identification' reduces the weight of shame and empowers the child to develop a relationship with the challenge rather than being defined by it."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "During high-intensity play, a child begins to swing a wooden sword toward the coach's head. Following the A-C-T model, what is the correct first step?",
            "options": [
                "Command the child to stop immediately and sit in a chair.",
                "Acknowledge the child's feeling or desire (e.g., 'You are really excited and want to hit me').",
                "Communicate the limit (e.g., 'I am not for hitting').",
                "Target an alternative (e.g., 'You can hit the bop-bag instead')."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'A' in A-C-T stands for Acknowledge the feeling. Validating the child's internal experience first helps maintain the therapeutic connection before setting the limit."

            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'bottom-up' rhythmic intervention used for sensory-motor integration?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up interventions target the brainstem and limbic system through movement and rhythm, which is more effective for regulation than top-down cognitive 'talking' strategies."

                "The child's lack of artistic talent and need for drawing lessons.",
                "The metaphorical 'landscape' of power dynamics, perceived threats, and the child's sense of self-agency.",
                "Whether the child is using the correct colors for a sun.",
                "The child's ability to follow directions regarding the size of the drawing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projective art is about the metaphor. Proportions and placement often represent the child's internal 'map' of their world, including feelings of powerlessness or being 'overshadowed' by a threat."

            "id": "q23_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "S.P.A.R.K. begins with Safety and Somatic Awareness, ensuring the child's nervous system is regulated enough to engage in the deeper work of play."

            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A child who has experienced chronic neglect appears 'numb,' moves slowly, and shows very little emotional expression during play. This is a hallmark of which state?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-aroused Sympathetic",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dorsal Vagal activation is a survival mechanism involving immobilization and dissociation (shutdown), often seen in children with a history of chronic trauma or neglect."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "When a coach intentionally uses 'Therapeutic Mismatch' in somatic mirroring, what is the ultimate goal?",
            "options": [
                "To prove to the child that the coach is not a robot.",
                "To model 'Rupture and Repair,' helping the child learn that relationships can withstand minor conflict or disconnection.",
                "To make the child angry so they express their 'true' feelings.",
                "To see if the child is paying enough attention to notice the change."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intentional, mild mismatches followed by a quick 'repair' (re-attuning) help build the child's relational resilience and security."
