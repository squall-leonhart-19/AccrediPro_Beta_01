            "question": "In the Holistic S.P.A.R.K. Framework, what is the defining characteristic of moving from 'Linear' to 'Fluid' practice?",
            "options": [
                "Following the five steps in exact alphabetical order during every session",
                "The ability to transition between Safety, Play, Attunement, Regulation, and Kinesthetics based on the child's immediate physiological state",
                "Eliminating the 'Safety' phase once the child has attended more than five sessions",
                "Prioritizing 'Kinesthetics' only at the end of the therapeutic relationship"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluid practice allows the coach to respond to the child's nervous system in real-time, moving between framework elements as needs shift, rather than following a rigid, predetermined sequence."

        {
            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "When synthesizing non-verbal cues and projective themes (L2), a child who repeatedly builds 'fences' around a 'vulnerable' animal is likely demonstrating which projective theme?",
            "options": [
                "Nurturance and Caretaking",
                "Power and Control",
                "Protection and Boundary Formation",
                "Chaos and Disorganization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Building fences or barriers around vulnerable figures is a classic projective theme indicating a need for safety, containment, and the establishment of psychological boundaries."

        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of 'Somatic Synthesis' in the S.P.A.R.K. methodology?",
            "options": [
                "To teach the child to sit still for the duration of the narrative work",
                "To bridge the gap between physical movement (Kinesthetics) and emotional self-regulation",
                "To replace play-based interventions with traditional physical therapy exercises",
                "To ensure the child achieves a specific heart rate during play"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic synthesis focuses on 'Bottom-Up' processing, helping the child connect their physical sensations and movements to their emotional state to achieve deeper regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "In the 'Narrative Weaving' process (L4), why is the use of 'Externalization' through projective play considered essential?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the child to process traumatic or difficult self-stories at a safe psychological distance",
                "It forces the child to take direct responsibility for their actions immediately",
                "It speeds up the session by avoiding complex emotional discussions",
                "It is only used for children who are non-verbal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Externalization through toys or metaphors creates 'psychological distance,' allowing the child to explore and rewrite their 'Self-Story' without being overwhelmed by direct confrontation with trauma."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "According to Generalization Strategies (L5), which technique is most effective for 'Bridging' the S.P.A.R.K. framework from the playroom to the home?",
            "options": [
                "Giving the child a written exam on what they learned in the session",
                "Using 'Anchor Objects' or specific 'Transition Rituals' that are consistent in both environments",
                "Telling the child they cannot play at home until they practice regulation",
                "Increasing the frequency of sessions to five times per week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generalization is best achieved through 'anchors'—physical objects or familiar rituals that trigger the child's regulated state in environments outside the coaching room."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "When integrating caregivers into the S.P.A.R.K. Loop (L6), the coach's primary focus during joint sessions is often:",
            "options": [
                "Correcting the caregiver's parenting mistakes in front of the child",
                "Observing the child in isolation while the caregiver waits in the hall",
                "Co-regulating the caregiver so they can serve as an 'External Regulator' for the child",
                "Teaching the caregiver how to use the toys exactly like the coach does"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic synthesis recognizes that a child's regulation is dependent on the caregiver's state; therefore, the coach must support the caregiver's regulation to facilitate the family S.P.A.R.K. loop."

        {
            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "In Advanced Case Conceptualization (L7), why is 'Sensory-First' planning prioritized for children with complex trauma and neurodivergence?",
            "options": [
                "Because neurodivergent children cannot understand metaphors",
                "Because a dysregulated nervous system (low safety) prevents the prefrontal cortex from engaging in narrative or cognitive work",
                "Because sensory play is the only way to keep these children entertained",
                "Because trauma is only stored in the muscles, not the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For children with complex needs, the 'Safety' and 'Regulation' aspects of S.P.A.R.K. must be established at a sensory level before the brain is capable of higher-level narrative integration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "What defines the 'Master Practitioner’s Flow' (L8) during high-arousal states in the playroom?",
            "options": [
                "Stopping the play immediately whenever the child's volume increases",
                "Maintaining 'Dual Awareness'—staying attuned to the child's intensity while remaining internally regulated",
                "Joining the child's high-arousal state to match their energy exactly",
                "Using physical restraints to ensure the room remains tidy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual Awareness allows the coach to remain a 'calm anchor' even when the child is in a state of high arousal, providing the necessary containment for the child to safely explore intense emotions."

        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "During a session, a child begins aggressively throwing sand while shouting. A coach using 'Somatic Synthesis' would first:",
            "options": [
                "Explain the physics of sand to the child",
                "Identify the 'Kinesthetic' need for release and provide a safer, high-intensity somatic alternative (like throwing soft bolsters)",
                "Put the sand away and end the session early",
                "Ask the child to write a story about why they are angry"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic synthesis involves recognizing the physical urge (the need for high-intensity release) and redirecting it into a safe, kinesthetic activity that satisfies the nervous system's demand."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Systemic Synthesis' in the context of the S.P.A.R.K. methodology?",
            "options": [
                "A rigid set of rules for how families must behave at home",
                "The integration of the child's progress into the wider family, school, and social systems",
                "A software system used to track session notes",
                "The process of referring the child to a different specialist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic synthesis ensures that the 'S.P.A.R.K.' ignited in the playroom is supported by and integrated into the child's entire ecosystem, including caregivers and school environments."
