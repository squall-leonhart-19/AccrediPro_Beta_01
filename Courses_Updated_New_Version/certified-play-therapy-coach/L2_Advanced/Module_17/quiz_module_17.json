            "question": "A child exhibiting 'disorganized attachment' (Type D) during a play session is most likely to demonstrate which of the following behaviors?",
            "options": [
                "Consistent avoidance of the coach and focus on toys only",
                "Extreme distress upon separation followed by clinginess",
                "Contradictory behaviors, such as approaching the coach with head averted or freezing suddenly",
                "A total lack of interest in the play materials or the environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment is characterized by a lack of a coherent strategy for dealing with stress, often manifesting as 'fright without solution' through contradictory or jerky movements and freezing."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "When working with a neurodivergent child who has a 'Sensory-Avoidant' profile, which environmental modification is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the volume of background music to provide a rhythmic beat",
                "Reducing visual clutter, using dimmable lighting, and providing a 'crash pad' or quiet tent",
                "Introducing high-intensity tactile activities like shaving cream play immediately",
                "Using bright, primary colors throughout the play space to stimulate engagement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory-avoidant children are easily overwhelmed by stimuli; reducing visual and auditory input helps them maintain regulation within their window of tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In the context of chronic illness or traumatic loss, 'Ambiguous Loss' refers to a situation where:",
            "options": [
                "The child is unsure if they have lost a toy or a person",
                "A person is physically present but psychologically absent (e.g., due to dementia or severe illness)",
                "The child has not been told the truth about a death",
                "The loss occurred so long ago that the memory is faded"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ambiguous loss, a term coined by Pauline Boss, occurs when a person is physically present but psychologically changed or absent, which complicates the grieving process for the child."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Window of Tolerance' model, what should be the coach's primary intervention when a child enters a state of hyper-arousal (aggression/screaming)?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the child to verbally explain why they are feeling angry",
                "Implementing a strict time-out to show the coach is in control",
                "Co-regulation through low-arousal techniques, such as softening the voice and rhythmic movement",
                "Ignoring the behavior until the child chooses to stop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a child is outside their window of tolerance, cognitive processing is offline. The coach must first use co-regulation to return the child to a state of physiological safety."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a clinical 'red flag' for dissociation during a play therapy session?",
            "options": [
                "The child becomes very loud and begins throwing soft toys",
                "The child's eyes become glazed, they stop responding to their name, and appear 'spaced out'",
                "The child repeatedly asks to go to the bathroom",
                "The child insists on playing the same game every week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation involves a mental disconnection from the present moment; glazed eyes and unresponsiveness are classic signs that the child has 'checked out' to cope with perceived overwhelming stress."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In cases of high-conflict divorce and potential parental alienation, what is the most ethical stance for a Play Therapy Coach?",
            "options": [
                "To determine which parent is 'better' and advocate for them in court",
                "To remain a neutral, child-centered professional who focuses on the child's internal experience rather than parental disputes",
                "To encourage the child to tell the 'alienating' parent exactly how they feel",
                "To share all session notes with both lawyers to ensure transparency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining neutrality is critical in systemic complexity. The coach's role is to provide a safe space for the child, not to become an investigator or an advocate for one parent over the other."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Burnout' and 'Secondary Traumatic Stress' (STS)?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is caused by trauma, while STS is caused by paperwork",
                "Burnout is a gradual exhaustion, while STS involves symptoms that mimic PTSD after hearing about a client's trauma",
                "STS only happens to inexperienced coaches, while burnout happens to veterans",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Traumatic Stress (or Vicarious Trauma) specifically refers to the coach experiencing PTSD-like symptoms (intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance) resulting from exposure to the client's traumatic material."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "When working with a child with Selective Mutism, which technique is recommended to build communication safety?",
            "options": [
                "Asking 'Yes/No' questions exclusively to make it easy for them",
                "Waiting in silence for at least 60 seconds after asking a question to force a response",
                "Using 'Staged Communication' where the coach narrates the child's play without requiring a verbal response",
                "Telling the child they will get a prize as soon as they say 'Hello'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrating (tracking) the child's play builds rapport and lowers the pressure to speak, which is essential in the early stages of working with Selective Mutism."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Research indicates that what percentage of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also experience significant sensory processing challenges?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Approximately 40-50%",
                "Approximately 60-70%",
                "Over 80-90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as Tomchek & Dunn, 2007) consistently show that the vast majority (over 80-90%) of children on the autism spectrum exhibit significant sensory processing differences."

            "question": "Nancy Verrier's concept of the 'Primal Wound' in adoption suggests that:",
            "options": [
                "Adoption is always a seamless transition if done at birth",
                "The initial separation from the biological mother is a traumatic event that leaves a lasting psychological impact regardless of the age of adoption",
                "Children only experience trauma if they are told they are adopted",
                "Physical wounds from birth are the primary cause of behavioral issues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Primal Wound' theory posits that the severance of the bond between the biological mother and infant is a significant trauma that influences identity and attachment throughout the adoptee's life."
