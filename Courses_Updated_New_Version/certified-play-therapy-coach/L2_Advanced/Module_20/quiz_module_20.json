            "question": "In Advanced Observational Assessment (L1), what is the primary distinction between a behavioral description and a clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "A description documents observable actions (e.g., 'child threw the block'), while interpretation assigns meaning (e.g., 'child is feeling frustrated').",
                "A description is used for insurance, while interpretation is used for parents.",
                "Interpretations are always recorded in the 'Objective' section of SOAP notes.",
                "Descriptions are only used for children under the age of five."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Effective assessment requires separating objective observations (what the child does) from the coach's subjective interpretation (the underlying meaning or emotion)."

            "question": "In Projective Play Assessment (L2), a child who repeatedly buries figures deep in the sand and leaves them there without 'rescuing' them may be symbolically representing:",
            "options": [
                "Advanced fine motor skills and tactile seeking.",
                "A desire for gardening or outdoor play.",
                "Feelings of being overwhelmed, hidden, or 'lost' within their environment.",
                "High levels of cognitive organization and spatial awareness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Projective techniques like sandplay allow children to externalize internal states; burying without retrieval often points to themes of helplessness or emotional suppression."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (L3), if a child suddenly becomes 'flat' in affect, avoids eye contact, and moves into a corner of the room during play, they are likely experiencing:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is characterized by immobilization, withdrawal, and a decrease in physiological arousal, often as a response to perceived extreme threat."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioception involves the sense of self-movement and body position; 'crashing' or seeking deep pressure is a common somatic way children attempt to ground their nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In standardized scales, a very low defensive responding score suggests the respondent is not being fully candid about the difficulties they are facing, which is vital for the coach to know."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Over-functioning or enmeshment occurs when a parent's boundaries overlap with the child's, preventing the child from expressing their own agency in the play space."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Themes of cages, locks, and heroes often relate to the child's internal struggle with power, safety, and the ability to control 'scary' or 'bad' impulses/situations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Objective section must contain measurable, observable data (times, specific actions, physical signs) rather than feelings or unsubstantiated diagnoses."

                "The child's ability to tell a coherent story with a beginning, middle, and end.",
                "The child's quality of movement, muscle tone, and how they navigate the physical play space.",
                "The number of words a child uses during a 45-minute session.",
                "The specific colors the child chooses for their artwork."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kinesthetic assessment looks at the 'body in motion,' observing how physical movement reflects the child's emotional state and neurological integration."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Why is it essential to track 'Play Themes' over multiple sessions rather than just one (L7)?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the coach gets paid for more sessions.",
                "Because children's play is random and never repeats the same theme twice.",
                "To identify 'Persistent Themes' which indicate unresolved emotional issues versus 'Transient Themes' which may just reflect recent events.",
                "Standardized scales require at least 10 sessions of data to be valid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "One-time play themes might simply reflect a movie the child watched; persistent themes that recur over weeks indicate the core emotional work the child is trying to process."
