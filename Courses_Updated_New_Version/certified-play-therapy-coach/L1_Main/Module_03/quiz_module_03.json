            "question": "What is the primary distinction between 'Attachment' and 'Attunement' within the context of the Play Therapy Coach™ methodology?",
            "options": [
                "Attunement is the internal state of being in resonance with the child's experience, while Attachment is the enduring relational bond.",
                "Attachment refers to the coach's feelings, while Attunement refers only to the child's behavior.",
                "They are interchangeable terms describing the same neurobiological process.",
                "Attunement is a cognitive assessment, while Attachment is a physical proximity requirement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Attunement is the moment-to-moment process of being 'in sync' with another's internal state, which serves as the building block for a secure Attachment bond."

                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (VMPFC)",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The VMPFC is a key component of the social brain that processes empathy and resonance, allowing for the integration of sensory data into a coherent understanding of another's mind."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tracking Behavior involves providing a verbal 'play-by-play' of the child's observable actions without adding interpretation or labels to their emotions."

                "The use of metaphors in play.",
                "The physical distance and spatial relationship between the coach and the child.",
                "The child's ability to use fine motor skills."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proxemics is the study of how humans use space; in play therapy, adjusting one's physical distance is a vital tool for maintaining attunement and safety."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "What is a significant clinical risk of 'Mechanical Mirroring' (imitating a child's actions without emotional resonance)?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the session move too quickly.",
                "It can feel mocking, intrusive, or mocking to the child, potentially causing a rupture.",
                "It causes the coach to lose track of time.",
                "It prevents the child from using the sand tray."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirroring must be empathic and 'felt'; if it is merely mimicry, the child may perceive it as insincere or a violation of their autonomy."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Research by Dr. Ed Tronick (The Still Face Experiment) suggests that 'mismatches' or ruptures occur in approximately what percentage of interactions in healthy dyads?",

                "10%",
                "30%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tronick's research indicates that even the most attuned pairs are out of sync about 70% of the time; the strength of the relationship lies in the frequency of repair, not the absence of ruptures."

            "id": "q3_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-context cultures, much of the meaning is conveyed through non-verbal cues and the shared environment rather than explicit verbalization."

                "Ignore the reaction and wait for the child to turn back around.",
                "Correct the child and explain why the coach was actually right.",

                "Put the child in a time-out for being disrespectful."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Repair begins with the coach taking responsibility for the 'miss' and validating the child's experience of being misunderstood."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Schore emphasizes that the 'relational' work of therapy is primarily a right-brain process involving the regulation of affect through non-verbal resonance."
