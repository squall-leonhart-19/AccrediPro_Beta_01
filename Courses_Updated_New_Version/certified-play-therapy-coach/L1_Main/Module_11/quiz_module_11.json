            "question": "In the context of the S.P.A.R.K. Deep Dive, what is the primary purpose of the 'Indestructible Container' in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a physical box for storing play therapy equipment",
                "To create a psychological space where the coach remains regulated despite the child's intense emotional discharge",
                "To ensure the child remains physically confined to the playroom",
                "To limit the child's choices to only 'safe' toys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Indestructible Container' refers to the coach's ability to maintain a regulated, non-reactive presence that can absorb and hold the child's most intense expressions without the coach 'breaking' or becoming dysregulated."

            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Aesthetic Distance' in projective play. Why is this concept critical for trauma processing?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the child to process difficult emotions through a metaphor, making it safe enough to approach",
                "It ensures the child stays at least six feet away from the coach for safety",
                "It encourages the child to use more expensive, high-quality art materials",
                "It prevents the child from becoming too imaginative during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Aesthetic distance provides a 'psychological buffer.' By projecting their experience onto a puppet or toy, the child can explore traumatic themes without being overwhelmed by direct confrontation."

            "options": [
                "Repeating exactly what the child says in a high-pitched voice",
                "Mimicking the child's large motor movements only",
                "Subtly reflecting the child's facial expressions, breathing rhythms, and muscle tension",
                "Drawing a small version of whatever the child draws"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-mirroring is a somatic attunement technique where the coach subtly matches the child's autonomic state through physiological cues like breath and facial micro-expressions."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 5), a child who exhibits a 'flat affect,' lethargy, and lack of eye contact is likely in which state?",

                "The Flow State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the 'brake' of the nervous system, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and energy conservation when a threat feels inescapable."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, Kinesthetic Integration (K) suggests that 'bottom-up' processing is effective because:",
            "options": [
                "It focuses on logical reasoning first",
                "It utilizes movement and sensory input to influence the brainstem and limbic system before the cortex",
                "It requires the child to memorize specific movement sequences",
                "It is only used for children with physical disabilities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing starts with the body and the lower brain centers. By integrating movement, we can help regulate the nervous system in ways that talk-based (top-down) methods cannot."

                "To pick only one letter of the framework to focus on for the entire year",

                "To write a 50-page clinical report for insurance purposes",
                "To ensure the child plays with every toy in the room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis involves looking at how the five threads (Safety, Projective, Attunement, Regulation, Kinesthetic) intersect to form a cohesive picture of the child's internal world and needs."

            "options": [
                "A sign that the child is bored with the hero figure",
                "A potential metaphor for feeling overwhelmed, hidden, or needing protection",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projective play uses symbolism. Burying a figure often represents themes of concealment, safety, or being 'buried' by life's pressures."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vicarious resilience is the 'flip side' of vicarious trauma; it is the inspiration and growth we experience as professionals when we witness the strength and recovery of our clients."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A child in the playroom is stuck in a high-arousal Sympathetic state (hyperactivity). Which kinesthetic intervention would be MOST regulating?",

                "Asking the child to sit in a chair and explain their feelings",
                "Rhythmic, repetitive movement like a slow drumbeat or heavy pushing (proprioception)",

                "Turning on bright, flashing lights and loud music"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rhythmic, repetitive, and proprioceptive (heavy work) movements are grounding and help down-regulate a hyper-aroused sympathetic nervous system."

            "question": "What is the primary ethical consideration regarding 'Self-Disclosure' in the S.P.A.R.K. framework?",

                "Coaches should tell the child all their personal problems to build rapport",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical self-disclosure must always be client-centered. It should only be used if it enhances the child's safety or provides a necessary 'human' connection that facilitates the child's growth."
