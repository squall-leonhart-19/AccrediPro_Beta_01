            "options": [
                "Safety, Play, Action, Resilience, Knowledge",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The S.P.A.R.K. Method™ stands for Pillar S: Secure Therapeutic Container, Pillar P: Projective Play, Pillar A: Mastery of Attunement, Pillar R: Regulation and Resiliency, and Pillar K: Kinesthetic Integration."

            "question": "In Pillar S (Secure Therapeutic Container), the concept of 'Holding Space' is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "Setting strict rules and time limits to ensure the child stays on task.",
                "Physically restraining a child to prevent them from hurting toys.",
                "Maintaining a non-judgmental, emotionally stable presence that allows the child to explore difficult feelings without the coach attempting to 'fix' them.",
                "Providing a large enough physical room for the child to run around in."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Holding space is a psychological and emotional skill where the coach provides a 'container' of safety, allowing the child to express their internal world without the coach's ego or need for immediate solutions interfering."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to Pillar P, why is 'Externalization' through metaphor considered a safer way for children to process trauma or stress?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the child to talk about their problems directly to the coach.",
                "It creates 'psychological distance,' allowing the child to explore intense emotions through a character or object rather than themselves.",
                "It ensures the child doesn't remember the actual events of their life.",
                "It makes the session more entertaining and keeps the child's attention longer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization via metaphor provides a buffer. By projecting their feelings onto a puppet or a 'broken bridge' in a sand tray, the child can process the emotion without being overwhelmed by the direct reality of the experience."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In Pillar A (Mastery of Attunement), 'Somatic Mirroring' involves which of the following techniques?",
            "options": [
                "Correcting the child's posture to ensure they are sitting properly.",
                "Subtly reflecting the child’s breathing rate, facial expressions, and energy level to build a neurobiological connection.",
                "Repeating every word the child says back to them in a high-pitched voice.",
                "Recording the session and playing it back to the child so they can see themselves."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic mirroring is a deep form of attunement where the coach synchronizes their nervous system with the child's, signaling safety and understanding at a non-verbal level."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Under Pillar R (Regulation), a child who becomes suddenly 'numb,' 'spaced out,' or 'frozen' during a play session is likely experiencing which state of the Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)",
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Collapse)",
                "The Window of Tolerance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the body's most primitive defense mechanism, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and 'shutting down' when the system perceives an existential threat."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Pillar K (Kinesthetic Integration) emphasizes 'Bottom-Up' processing. Why is this critical in play coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Because children learn to read and write before they learn to move.",
                "Because the brain develops from the brainstem up, and sensory-motor integration must precede high-level cognitive reflection.",
                "Because it is easier to teach a child to sit still than to teach them to think.",
                "Because physical exercise is the only way to burn off excess energy in a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing addresses the lower regions of the brain (sensory and motor) first. Since trauma and stress are often stored somatically, we must stabilize the body and nervous system before the child can engage in 'top-down' cognitive reasoning."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Regarding Ethics and Scope (L7), when must a Play Therapy Coach refer a client to a licensed clinical therapist or psychiatrist?",
            "options": [
                "When the child is simply bored with the coaching sessions.",
                "When the child shows signs of clinical pathology, active suicidal ideation, or severe unmanaged trauma.",
                "When the parents ask for a discount on the session fees.",
                "When the coach wants to take a vacation and needs someone to cover their shifts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaching focuses on resiliency and skill-building. If a child presents with symptoms that require clinical diagnosis, medication, or deep trauma processing (psychotherapy), it is outside the coach's scope and requires a professional referral."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In the S.P.A.R.K. Session Roadmap (L8), what is the primary purpose of the 'Intake' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To begin the first play intervention immediately with the child.",
                "To gather developmental history, build a collaborative alliance with parents, and set non-clinical behavioral goals.",
                "To diagnose the child with a specific mental health disorder.",
                "To determine how many toys the child owns at home."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Intake phase is about foundation-building: understanding the child's history, ensuring the coach-parent-child fit, and defining what success looks like for the coaching engagement."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A 7-year-old client in his 4th session begins throwing sand and screaming 'I hate this game!' Using Pillar R and Pillar A, what is your first response?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately put the child in a time-out and end the session early.",
                "Ignore the behavior so you don't reinforce it with attention.",
                "Co-regulate by lowering your own voice, validating the intensity of the feeling ('You are feeling so frustrated right now!'), and offering a grounding sensory activity.",
                "Ask the child to explain the cognitive reasons why they are angry."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the S.P.A.R.K. Method, we prioritize co-regulation. By staying calm (Pillar A) and validating the emotion while redirecting to a grounding activity (Pillar R), we help the child return to their Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course suggests that play-based interventions that include 'Somatic Integration' (Pillar K) result in what percentage of improvement in emotional regulation compared to talk-only coaching?",
            "options": [
                "No significant difference",
                "Approximately 15% improvement",
                "Approximately 40-60% greater improvement in self-regulation scores",
                "100% improvement for all children"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that incorporating somatic and kinesthetic elements significantly outperforms purely cognitive approaches for children, often showing 40-60% better outcomes in regulation and resilience metrics."
