            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "It creates 'psychological distance,' reducing amygdala hijacking and allowing the prefrontal cortex to engage.",
                "It forces the child to confront their trauma directly without the use of metaphors.",
                "It shuts down the right hemisphere of the brain to focus on logical reasoning.",
                "It eliminates the need for the coach to communicate with the child."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Externalization through puppets or toys provides a safe distance from the conflict, preventing the child from becoming overwhelmed (amygdala hijacking) while they process the issue."

                "'Let's try to make the cars drive safely on the road instead.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective tracking in Pillar A involves narrating the child's actions and intensity without asking 'why,' interpreting motives prematurely, or redirecting the play."

            "options": [

                "They are the only way to tire a child out so they sit still.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Bridge' is a critical transition phase that helps the child regulate and ground themselves before returning to their daily environment."

                "Approximately 15%",
                "Up to 40%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety (Pillar S) must be established before any other work can begin. If a child does not feel secure in the container, they cannot engage in projective or somatic play."
