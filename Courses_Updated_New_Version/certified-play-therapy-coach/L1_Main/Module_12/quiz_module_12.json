            "question": "In the S.P.A.R.K. framework, what is the primary function of the 'S' (Safety & Security) phase before moving into deeper work?",
            "options": [
                "To establish a rigid set of rules for the playroom",
                "To down-regulate the sympathetic nervous system and activate the ventral vagal state",
                "To ensure the coach is physically safe from the child's aggression",
                "To complete the intake paperwork and diagnostic assessments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety in the S.P.A.R.K. framework is rooted in Polyvagal Theory; the child must be in a ventral vagal (social engagement) state to access the higher-order processing required for change."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of trust (Lesson 2), which neurochemical is primarily responsible for the 'bonding' and social buffering against stress during attunement?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Adrenaline",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Dopamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin facilitates social bonding and trust, counteracting the effects of cortisol and allowing the child to feel secure within the coaching relationship."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A child uses a puppet to describe a 'scary monster' that lives under their bed. In Projective Play (Lesson 3), this is an example of:",

                "Somatic Marking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization is the process of moving an internal conflict or fear onto an external object (like a puppet), which provides the 'psychological distance' necessary to process the emotion safely."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Advanced Attunement (Lesson 4) involves 'Emotional Mirroring.' Which of the following best describes the correct application of this technique?",
            "options": [
                "Mimicking the child's exact physical movements like a mime",
                "Correcting the child's behavior by showing them the 'right' way to play",
                "Reflecting the intensity and quality of the child's affect through facial expression and tone",
                "Ignoring the child's emotions to maintain a neutral environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional mirroring is about reflecting the 'affect' or feeling behind the action, ensuring the child feels 'felt' and understood on a neurobiological level."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A child is showing signs of sensory seeking, crashing into foam blocks and stomping loudly. According to Lesson 5, which sensory system are they likely trying to regulate?",

                "Auditory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioception involves input from muscles and joints. 'Heavy work' like crashing or stomping provides grounding input that helps organize the nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Kinesthetic Integration (Lesson 6) emphasizes a 'Bottom-Up' approach. What does this mean in the context of play coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Starting with cognitive talk therapy before moving to play",
                "Focusing on the brainstem and limbic system through body movement before engaging the prefrontal cortex",
                "Beginning the session on the floor and moving to chairs later",
                "Teaching the child to think about their feelings before they feel them"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing addresses the lower brain regions (survival and emotional centers) through somatic and kinesthetic play before attempting logical or cognitive interventions."

            "id": "q12_7",

            "options": [
                "The physical door the child enters",
                "The specific phase of the framework (S, P, A, R, or K) that matches the child's most immediate need",
                "The first question asked during the parent interview",
                "The moment the coach decides to end the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Case conceptualization involves identifying where the child is stuck—for example, if they lack regulation (R), that becomes the entry point for the intervention plan."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses Professional Ethics. If a Play Therapy Coach feels a child's needs exceed their 'Scope of Practice' (e.g., severe clinical trauma), what is the most ethical action?",
            "options": [
                "Continue coaching but read more books on the topic",
                "Ask the child to stop talking about the trauma",
                "Refer the family to a licensed clinical mental health professional",
                "Switch to a different play framework immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practitioners recognize the limits of their training (Scope of Practice) and refer out when a client's needs require clinical psychotherapy rather than coaching."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Leo' (Lesson 7), he built a 'fortress' out of cushions and refused to let the coach in. This behavior most likely represents which S.P.A.R.K. element being tested?",

                "Kinesthetic Integration",
                "Safety & Security",

                "Regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Building a fortress is a classic projective metaphor for establishing Safety & Security. The child is physically manifesting their need for a boundary."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of play-based interventions (referenced in the module) found that consistent attunement can improve emotional regulation scores by what average percentage in children with ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "22%",
                "35%",
                "60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights research showing that targeted attunement and regulation strategies can lead to a 35% improvement in emotional regulation markers for neurodivergent children."
