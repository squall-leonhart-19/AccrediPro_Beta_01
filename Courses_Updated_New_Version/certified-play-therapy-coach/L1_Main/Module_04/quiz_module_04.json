            "question": "According to the neurobiological principles discussed in Lesson 1, which part of the brain must be 'offline' or bypassed for a child to enter a state of pure 'fight-or-flight' during play?",
            "options": [
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Thalamus",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a child becomes dysregulated, the 'upstairs brain' (Prefrontal Cortex) often goes offline, leaving the 'downstairs brain' (Amygdala and Brainstem) to take over survival functions."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client named Sarah (age 7) sits in the corner of the playroom, avoids eye contact, and appears 'spaced out' after a loud noise occurs outside. Which state of arousal is Sarah likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-arousal",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "Hypo-arousal",
                "The Window of Tolerance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by numbness, withdrawal, and 'freezing' or 'flopping' as the nervous system attempts to protect itself by shutting down."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'The Coach as a Co-Regulator,' what is the primary function of mirror neurons in the playroom?",
            "options": [
                "To allow the child to mimic the coach's physical movements for motor skill development",
                "To allow the child's nervous system to 'read' and sync with the coach's calm state",
                "To help the coach identify if the child is lying about their feelings",
                "To increase the child's self-esteem through positive reinforcement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow the child to subconsciously pick up on the coach's internal state; if the coach remains regulated, the child's nervous system can 'borrow' that calm (co-regulation)."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which sensory system is being targeted when a Play Therapy Coach uses 'heavy work' activities, such as pushing a weighted trolley or wearing a weighted vest?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular",
                "Tactile",
                "Proprioceptive",
                "Olfactory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input involves the muscles and joints; 'heavy work' provides grounding feedback that is often highly regulating for children in hyper-aroused states."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Dr. Bruce Perry’s 'Neurosequential Model' (Regulate-Relate-Reason) suggests that coaches should follow which order of intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Talk about the problem, then play, then calm down",
                "Calm the brainstem (Regulate), connect through relationship (Relate), then access the cortex (Reason)",
                "Reward good behavior, ignore bad behavior, then discuss the day",
                "Reason with the child first so they understand why they need to be calm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "You cannot reason with a dysregulated child. You must first regulate the lower brain centers and establish a relational connection before cognitive reasoning is possible."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Lesson 5 emphasizes 'Rhythm and Repetition.' Why is rhythmic drumming or swinging effective for a child who has experienced developmental trauma?",
            "options": [
                "It distracts them from their memories",
                "It mimics the maternal resting heart rate, providing bottom-up brainstem regulation",
                "It improves their musical ability and cognitive processing speed",
                "It tires the child out so they are more compliant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rhythmic, repetitive, and somatosensory activities provide 'bottom-up' regulation by mimicking the soothing cadences found in utero and early infancy."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "During a game of 'Freeze Dance' (Lesson 6), a child struggles to stop when the music ends. This game is specifically designed to strengthen which executive function?",
            "options": [
                "Working Memory",
                "Cognitive Flexibility",
                "Inhibitory Control",
                "Auditory Processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inhibitory control (impulse control) is the ability to stop a physical or emotional impulse. Games like 'Freeze Dance' provide a playful way to practice this skill."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "When teaching 'Balloon Breathing' (Lesson 7), the coach encourages the child to 'blow out the candle' slowly. What is the physiological purpose of the long exhalation?",
            "options": [
                "To increase oxygen levels in the blood",
                "To stimulate the Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "To stimulate the Vagus Nerve and activate the Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "To strengthen the intercostal muscles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exhalation is linked to the parasympathetic nervous system (the 'brake'). Slowing the exhale signals the body to lower the heart rate and reduce cortisol."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, why is the 'Clean-Up' phase of the session considered a critical regulation tool rather than just a chore?",
            "options": [
                "It teaches the child to respect the coach's property",
                "It provides a predictable transition that signals the 'closing' of the emotional container",
                "It allows the coach to see if the child is being defiant",
                "It ensures the next client has a clean room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transitions are often difficult for dysregulated children. A structured clean-up ritual provides predictability and closure, helping the child transition back to the outside world."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A 2021 study on Play-Based Interventions (referenced in Module 4) found that children who engaged in 15 minutes of rhythmic co-regulation showed a significant decrease in which physiological marker?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose",
                "Salivary Cortisol",
                "White Blood Cell Count",
                "Alpha-Amylase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Salivary cortisol is a common marker for stress. Rhythmic co-regulation has been shown to significantly reduce cortisol levels in children with high stress-reactivity."
