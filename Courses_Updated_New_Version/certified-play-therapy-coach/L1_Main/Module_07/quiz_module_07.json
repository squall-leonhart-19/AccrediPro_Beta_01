            "question": "In the context of the Neurobiology of the Therapeutic Container (L1), which brain region is primarily responsible for down-regulating the amygdala when a child feels 'felt' by the coach?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The vmPFC provides top-down inhibitory control over the amygdala, facilitating emotional regulation when the therapeutic container provides a sense of safety and attunement."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A child in a session chooses a 'broken shield' figurine to represent themselves. According to Lesson 2 on Decoding Symbolic Metaphors, this 'Symbolic Distance' serves what primary function?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates the child is refusing to engage with their real problems",
                "It allows the child to explore vulnerable themes without triggering an overwhelming 'ego-threat'",
                "It suggests a developmental delay in abstract thinking",
                "It is a sign of resistance that requires the coach to confront the metaphor directly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Symbolic distance provides a 'psychological buffer,' allowing the child to process trauma or difficult emotions through a metaphor that feels safe enough to explore."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 defines 'Micro-Attunement' through somatic mirroring. If a coach subtly matches a child's postural lean and vocal prosody, which neural system is being activated to build rapport?",
            "options": [
                "The Alpha-Adrenergic System",
                "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS)",
                "The Vestibular System",
                "The HPA Axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mirror Neuron System allows the coach and child to experience a sense of 'shared intentionality' and emotional resonance through somatic and affective mirroring."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "During a high-arousal state (Lesson 4), a child begins throwing pillows aggressively. Which 'heavy work' intervention is most effective for sensory-motor regulation via proprioceptive input?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the child to sit still and count to ten",
                "Having the child perform 'wall pushes' or carry a heavy bin of toys",
                "Turning off the lights to reduce visual stimulation",
                "Engaging the child in a fast-paced game of tag"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input (heavy work) provides 'grounding' feedback to the nervous system, helping to organize a disorganized or hyper-aroused state."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, Kinesthetic Integration is used to 'solidify' cognitive breakthroughs. Why is movement essential after a child realizes a new coping strategy?",
            "options": [
                "It distracts the child from the intensity of the realization",
                "Movement helps encode the 'new story' into the procedural memory of the body",
                "It is simply a way to burn off excess energy before the session ends",
                "It ensures the child stays awake during the final minutes of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kinesthetic integration moves an insight from a purely 'top-down' cognitive understanding to a 'bottom-up' embodied experience, making the change more sustainable."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Within the trauma-informed S.P.A.R.K. Method (Lesson 6), what does the 'R' stand for, and what is its clinical focus?",
            "options": [
                "Regulate; focusing on heart rate variability",
                "Resonance; focusing on the limbic connection between coach and child",
                "Resistance; identifying where the child is blocking progress",
                "Recall; asking the child to remember the details of their trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resonance refers to the interpersonal neurobiology where the coach's calm nervous system 'resonates' with the child's, facilitating co-regulation."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on Assessment, what does a high score in 'Symbolic Fluidity' typically indicate about a child's progress?",
            "options": [
                "The child is confused and cannot stick to one story",
                "The child is demonstrating increased psychological flexibility and ego-strength",
                "The child is likely experiencing a manic episode",
                "The child is overly dependent on the coach for direction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Symbolic fluidity—the ability to move flexibly between different play themes and metaphors—is a hallmark of healthy psychological processing and integration."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8 (Case Conceptualization), what is the final stage of moving from 'Projection' to 'Integration'?",
            "options": [
                "The coach explains the metaphor's meaning to the parents",
                "The child 'bridges' the metaphor by applying the toy's solution to their own real-life situation",
                "The coach takes a photo of the sandtray for the files",
                "The child destroys the play creation to show they are finished with it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration occurs when the child can successfully 'bridge' the insights gained in the symbolic world of play into their real-world behavior and self-concept."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module found that coaches who utilized 'Pacing and Leading' (Lesson 3) saw what percentage increase in client-reported 'felt safety' compared to those using verbal reflection alone?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "42%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that somatic pacing and leading (micro-attunement) significantly enhances the perception of safety (approx. 42%) compared to purely verbal interventions."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "When conceptualizing a case where a child repeatedly 'buries' treasure and never finds it (Lesson 8), the coach should primarily look for themes of:",
            "options": [
                "Financial insecurity in the home",
                "Unresolved loss or 'hidden' aspects of the self that feel inaccessible",
                "A lack of interest in the play materials",
                "The child's desire to be a geologist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Repetitive themes of burying and failing to retrieve items often symbolize 'disassociated' or 'hidden' parts of the self or unresolved grief that the child is not yet ready to 'uncover'."
