            "question": "Which brain structure is primarily responsible for the 'bottom-up' processing of proprioceptive and vestibular input essential for kinesthetic integration?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Broca’s Area"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The cerebellum processes sensory input from the body and plays a critical role in motor control and the 'bottom-up' regulation of the nervous system."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In Somatic Externalization, moving from a 'felt-sense' to a 'seen-sense' is designed to achieve what primary therapeutic goal?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the child's verbal vocabulary for emotions",
                "To create psychological distance and reduce emotional flooding",
                "To improve the child's fine motor skills through clay work",
                "To ensure the child follows the coach's specific directions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization allows the child to view their internal sensations as separate from themselves, which reduces the intensity of the emotion (flooding) and allows for safer exploration."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A child presents with hypo-arousal (numbness, dissociation, and lethargy). According to Sensory-Motor Protocols, which intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Soft, slow rocking in a darkened room",
                "Deep pressure and proprioceptive 'heavy work' like pushing against a wall",
                "Guided meditation focused on stillness",
                "Gentle whispering and minimal movement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal requires alerting, proprioceptive input (heavy work) to bring the child back into the Window of Tolerance, whereas slow rocking is better for hyper-arousal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rhythms of 60–80 BPM mimic a resting heart rate, which helps regulate the autonomic nervous system and promotes a sense of safety."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "During the Body-Map Technique, a child draws 'spikes' in their throat. What is the correct next step in the Kinesthetic Projection process?",
            "options": [
                "Ask the child to explain why they feel spikes using 'I feel' statements",
                "Invite the child to find a play object or movement that represents those 'spikes'",
                "Correct the child and suggest that spikes usually represent anger",
                "Move immediately to a relaxation exercise to make the spikes go away"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kinesthetic Projection involves moving from the internal map to an external representation (movement or object) to facilitate play-based processing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Kinesthetic Anchoring uses physical cues to trigger regulated states, relying on the brain's ability to create lasting neural pathways through repeated, paired stimuli."

            "options": [
                "It forces the child to pay attention to the coach's rules",
                "It activates mirror neurons, fostering a sense of social connection and safety",
                "It ensures the child's movements are perfectly symmetrical",
                "It speeds up the session so more topics can be covered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirroring activates the mirror neuron system, which is foundational for empathy, attunement, and the 'Social Engagement System' described in Polyvagal Theory."

                "By Leo writing a letter to his teacher",
                "By Leo pressing his thumb and forefinger together while recalling a state of 'calm power'",
                "By the coach giving Leo a sticker for good behavior",
                "By Leo sitting still for ten minutes at the end of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leo used a specific physical gesture (thumb to forefinger) to 'anchor' the regulated state he achieved during the session, allowing him to recall it later in the classroom."
