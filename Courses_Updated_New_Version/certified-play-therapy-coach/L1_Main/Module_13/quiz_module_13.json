            "question": "In the S.P.A.R.K. Framework architecture, what is the primary purpose of the 'A' (Attunement) phase following Projective Play?",
            "options": [
                "To correct the child's behavior through verbal instruction",
                "To establish a non-verbal resonance that validates the child's externalized experience",
                "To introduce sensory-based regulation tools for the first time",
                "To document the session's progress for parental review"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attunement (A) is the phase where the coach uses non-verbal resonance to mirror and validate the child's emotional state, bridging the gap between the child's internal world and the external play."

                "The variety of toys available in the room",
                "The coach's ability to interpret symbolic play correctly",
                "Predictability and the establishment of clear, consistent boundaries",
                "The child's willingness to speak about their feelings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety and Security are built on the 'Therapeutic Container,' which relies on predictability, consistency, and clear boundaries to make the child feel safe enough to explore difficult emotions."

            "options": [
                "It allows the child to blame others for their problems",
                "It creates 'psychological distance' so the child can observe conflicts without being overwhelmed",
                "It speeds up the coaching process by skipping the verbal phase",
                "It ensures the child forgets the traumatic event by focusing on toys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization creates 'psychological distance,' allowing the child to project their inner conflicts onto objects (like puppets or figurines), making the issues safer to process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 emphasizes Non-Verbal Resonance and Somatic Mirroring, where the coach subtly reflects the child's physical state to build attunement and begin the process of co-regulation."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "During a session, a child enters a state of 'Hyper-arousal.' Based on Lesson 5 (Regulation Techniques), which sensory input is most effective for immediate grounding?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input, often called 'heavy work' (like pushing against a wall or deep pressure), provides calming, grounding sensory feedback to a child in a state of hyper-arousal."

            "options": [
                "To tire the child out before they go home",
                "To move the child from symbolic play into physical movement that 'locks in' the emotional breakthrough",
                "To teach the child specific athletic skills",
                "To test the child's physical coordination and balance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kinesthetic Integration (K) involves using movement to somatically process and 'lock in' the emotional insights or shifts that occurred during the projective and attunement phases."

                "It follows the neurosequential model, moving from lower-brain safety to higher-brain integration",
                "It is designed to match the school day schedule",
                "It ensures the coach does the least amount of work possible",
                "There is no specific reason; the steps can be done in any order"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The S.P.A.R.K. framework is neurosequentially informed, starting with brainstem-level safety (S) and moving toward cortical integration (K)."

                "The time it takes for a child to arrive at the session",
                "The duration of the child's play sequences",
                "The amount of time it takes for a child to return to a regulated state after an emotional trigger",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovery Latency is a key data-driven metric measuring how quickly a child can return to their 'Window of Tolerance' after experiencing a stressor or trigger during play."

            "id": "q13_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using a broken toy to represent a family dynamic is an example of a Projective Metaphor, where the child uses the physical state of an object to describe an internal emotional reality."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "According to the data-driven coaching principles in Lesson 8, which of the following is a 'qualitative' rather than 'quantitative' marker of progress?",
            "options": [
                "Frequency of aggressive outbursts (tally count)",
                "Heart rate variability (HRV) readings",
                "The complexity and narrative coherence of the child’s play themes",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While tally counts, HRV, and time-tracking are quantitative (numerical), the thematic complexity and narrative of play are qualitative measures of a child's psychological processing."
