            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchoring involves pairing a specific physical gesture or sensation with a state of calm, allowing the child to 'anchor' back to safety when dysregulated."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rhythmic synchrony and mirroring between the coach and child strengthen the therapeutic bond and signal relational safety to the nervous system."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "During Kinesthetic Problem-Solving (Lesson 6), why is roleplay considered more effective than 'just talking' for neuroplasticity?",
            "options": [
                "It takes more time to complete, allowing for more billing hours",
                "It engages 'mirror neurons' and the motor cortex, creating a physical memory of the solution",
                "It prevents the child from having to think about their problems",
                "Children are naturally better actors than they are talkers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By physically acting out solutions, the brain encodes the 'win' as a motor memory, making the behavior more accessible in real-life high-stress situations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Portable kinesthetic cues serve as a bridge, allowing the child to access the somatic regulation learned in the playroom within a different environment."
