            "question": "The S.P.A.R.K. Method™ is a proprietary framework designed for Play Therapy Coaches. What does the 'P' in S.P.A.R.K. specifically stand for?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'P' stands for Projective Play, which focuses on tools for externalization, allowing the child to project internal conflicts onto external objects like puppets or sand trays."

            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Safety & Security), the 'Sacred Play Space' is described as a neurobiological necessity. Which branch of the autonomic nervous system must be active for a child to move from 'defense' to 'discovery'?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "Dorsal Vagal Complex",

                "Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is the 'social engagement system' that facilitates feelings of safety, connection, and the ability to engage in creative play."

            "question": "According to the lesson on Projective Play, what is the primary benefit of 'Externalization' for a child dealing with high levels of shame?",
            "options": [
                "It forces the child to take responsibility for their actions immediately.",
                "It separates the problem from the child's identity, making it easier to observe and solve.",
                "It speeds up the coaching process by bypassing the need for trust.",
                "It allows the coach to interpret the child's subconscious without their input."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization separates the problem from the person ('The problem is the problem, the person is not the problem'), which is crucial for reducing shame and increasing agency."

                "Ignore the behavior to keep the child focused on the play task.",
                "Verbally ask, 'Why are you looking at the door? Are you bored?'",
                "Reflect the shift: 'I noticed your eyes went to the door; I wonder if a part of you is checking if we're still safe here.'",
                "Redirect the child back to the toys immediately to maintain the session flow."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-tracking involves noticing and gently reflecting subtle shifts in the child's state, which validates their experience and builds the 'Emotional Bridge.'"

            "question": "Lesson 5 cites a 2023 meta-analysis regarding sensory-motor regulation. What specific physiological outcome was observed in 74% of children who utilized 'heavy work' (proprioceptive input) during moments of dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in heart rate variability (HRV), indicating better stress recovery.",
                "Immediate cessation of all vocal outbursts.",
                "A 40% increase in verbal communication skills.",
                "A decrease in Alpha wave activity in the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive 'heavy work' is shown to improve Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which is a key physiological marker of the body's ability to recover from stress and return to a calm state."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In the 'Kinesthetic Integration' phase (Lesson 6), what is the primary purpose of 'Somatic Anchoring'?",
            "options": [
                "To teach the child to sit still for longer periods of time.",
                "To create a physical movement or 'anchor' that helps the child recall a state of calm or power outside the session.",
                "To ensure the child gets enough physical exercise during the coaching hour.",
                "To test the child's gross motor skills for developmental delays."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Anchoring links a positive internal state (like calm or confidence) to a physical movement, allowing the child to 'trigger' that state in real-world environments like school."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "During the 'S.P.A.R.K. Assessment Cycle' (Lesson 7), a coach observes a child consistently choosing the 'broken' toys in the room. In which part of the cycle does the coach analyze this as a possible projection of the child's self-image?",

                "The Intake Phase",
                "The Observation & Hypothesis Phase",

                "The Kinesthetic Wrap-up"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Observation & Hypothesis phase is where the coach looks for patterns and themes in play (like choosing broken toys) to form a working theory about the child's internal world."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah' (Lesson 8), she displayed 'Avoidant Resistance' by only wanting to play board games with strict rules. The S.P.A.R.K. Mastery approach suggests the coach should:",
            "options": [
                "Refuse to play board games to force Sarah into more expressive play.",
                "Challenge Sarah's need for rules to break her rigidity.",
                "Honor the need for structure as a sign that Sarah currently requires high levels of 'S' (Safety) before moving to 'P' (Projective).",
                "End the session early because board games are not considered 'real' play therapy coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves recognizing that resistance (like rigid rule-following) is often a self-protective strategy. Honoring it builds the safety required for deeper work later."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "When working with the 'Regulation' (R) component, which sensory system is being engaged when a coach uses 'Wall Pushes' or 'Tug-of-War' to help a hyper-aroused child?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular",
                "Olfactory",

                "Auditory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Wall pushes and tug-of-war provide deep pressure to muscles and joints, which is proprioceptive input—the most grounding and regulating sensory system for children."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "The S.P.A.R.K. Method™ emphasizes that 'Mastery' (Lesson 8) is not about the child's behavior, but about the coach's 'Presence.' This is defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The coach's ability to remain regulated and non-judgmental, even when the child is dysregulated.",
                "The coach's ability to strictly follow the lesson plan regardless of the child's mood.",
                "The coach's physical presence in the room for at least 45 minutes.",
                "The coach's ability to provide the correct answers to the child's problems."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Presence is the coach's capacity to be a 'regulated other.' Through co-regulation, the coach's calm nervous system helps stabilize the child's nervous system."
