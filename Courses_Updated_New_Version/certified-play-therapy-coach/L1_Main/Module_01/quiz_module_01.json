            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which state of the autonomic nervous system must the Play Therapy Coach primarily embody to facilitate a child's neuro-biological safety?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic activation to match the child's energy",
                "Dorsal Vagal state to ensure total stillness",
                "Ventral Vagal state to signal social engagement and safety",
                "Hypo-arousal to minimize sensory input"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'social engagement system' where the heart rate slows and the face becomes expressive, signaling to the child's nervous system that they are safe to explore."

                "Creative-Expression toys (e.g., paints, clay)",
                "Acting-Out/Aggressive-Release toys (e.g., rubber knives, bop bags)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acting-Out and Aggressive-Release toys allow children to project and externalize internal conflicts and aggression in a controlled, symbolic environment."

            "options": [
                "Performance is about the coach's skill level; Presence is about the child's behavior.",
                "Performance focuses on achieving specific therapeutic outcomes; Presence focuses on 'being with' the child's current experience.",
                "Performance involves tracking the child; Presence involves staying silent.",
                "Performance is for beginners; Presence is for master-level coaches."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Presence prioritizes the relationship and the 'felt sense' of being understood, whereas Performance focuses on 'doing' the right technique or fixing a behavior."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistent time-keeping and specific warnings act as a 'containment' strategy, allowing the child to psychologically prepare for the transition."

            "options": [
                "It saves electricity and reduces overhead costs.",
                "It allows the coach to see the child better during tracking.",
                "It accommodates sensory sensitivities (e.g., autism, ADHD) where bright fluorescent lights may trigger a threat response.",
                "It makes the creative toys look more appealing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-inclusive design recognizes that environmental factors like harsh lighting can trigger 'neuroception' of threat in sensitive nervous systems."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ACT model follows: A (Acknowledge the feeling: 'You're excited to draw'), C (Communicate the limit: 'The wall is not for drawing on'), T (Target the alternative: 'You can draw on the paper or the easel')."

            "options": [
                "They allow the coach to mimic the child's movements to build rapport.",
                "They enable the child's nervous system to 'catch' the coach's calm, regulated state through co-regulation.",
                "They prevent the coach from feeling the child's distress.",
                "They are only active when the child is looking in a physical mirror."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons facilitate a biological 'resonance' where the child can subconsciously model the coach's internal state of regulation."

            "options": [
                "To convince the parents that the coach is always right.",
                "To ensure the parents provide a detailed list of the child's bad behaviors.",
                "To create a 'systemic safety net' where parents understand the process and support the child's progress.",
                "To collect the full payment for the module upfront."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic safety requires that the child's primary caregivers are aligned with the coaching philosophy, ensuring the child doesn't feel caught between the coach and the home."

                "Immediately end the session to maintain safety.",
                "Use a grounding technique (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method) to return to their own Ventral Vagal state.",
                "Tell the child that their play is making the coach uncomfortable.",
                "Ignore the feeling and continue tracking the child."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A coach cannot co-regulate a child if they are dysregulated themselves; grounding techniques help the coach regain the 'internal secure base' needed for the session."
