            "question": "In the context of 'The Science of Externalization,' why is moving an internal conflict to an external object (like a puppet) neurobiologically effective?",
            "options": [
                "It bypasses the prefrontal cortex entirely to focus on the brainstem.",
                "It reduces limbic arousal by creating psychological distance, allowing for higher-order processing.",
                "It eliminates the need for the coach to speak during the session.",
                "It forces the child to use the left hemisphere of the brain exclusively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization creates 'psychological distance,' which lowers amygdala activation (limbic arousal). This allows the child to process difficult emotions without being overwhelmed by the 'ego-threat' of direct discussion."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "The 'Third Object' phenomenon describes a specific triadic relationship. Which of the following best represents this triad?",
            "options": [
                "Coach, Child, and Parent",
                "Child, Toy, and Classroom",

                "Past, Present, and Future"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Third Object phenomenon involves the Coach, the Child, and the Projective Medium (the toy, sandtray, or art). The medium acts as a buffer and a bridge for communication."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When curating a Projective Toy Kit, why is it critical to include 'Aggressive' toys like rubber knives or soldiers?",
            "options": [
                "To encourage the child to be more violent in real life.",
                "To test if the child has conduct disorder.",
                "To provide a safe, symbolic outlet for the expression of anger and the reclamation of power.",
                "Because these toys are generally more durable than nurturing toys."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aggressive toys allow children to externalize feelings of anger, frustration, or powerlessness in a controlled, symbolic environment, which is essential for emotional regulation."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "During a puppetry session, a child has a lion puppet 'growl' at the coach. According to Lesson 4, what is the most effective coaching response?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the child, 'It's not nice to growl at people.'",
                "Address the lion directly: 'Mr. Lion, you seem very angry about something today.'",
                "Ignore the growl and ask the child how their school day was.",
                "Take the lion away until the child can play quietly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain the projective 'bubble,' the coach should address the puppet (the character) rather than the child. This respects the child's need for externalization and keeps the play safe."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In Projective Art and Sensory Media, what does the 'Process over Product' principle emphasize?",
            "options": [
                "The final artwork must be kept in a professional portfolio.",
                "The child's artistic skill is the primary indicator of cognitive health.",
                "The sensory experience and emotional expression during creation are more important than the aesthetic quality of the result.",
                "The coach should provide step-by-step instructions to ensure a perfect drawing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Projective play focuses on the 'process'—the smearing, kneading, or drawing—as these actions represent the child's internal state and emotional release, regardless of what the final 'product' looks like."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In Sandtray work, a child creates a 'congested' tray, tightly packing miniatures into one corner while leaving the rest of the tray empty. This often symbolizes:",
            "options": [
                "A high level of organizational skill.",
                "Feelings of being overwhelmed, restricted, or internal anxiety.",
                "A lack of imagination.",
                "That the child is bored with the available miniatures."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A congested or 'crowded' tray often reflects the child's internal experience of feeling overwhelmed, pressured, or trapped by their current life circumstances."

                "Power and Control"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Themes of being lost and then saved are classic 'Rescue' metaphors, often indicating a child's search for safety, security, or a desire for a caregiver's protection."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A 2021 study on projective techniques (n=450) indicated that children using sensory media (like clay) showed a significant reduction in cortisol levels. This supports the use of sensory media for:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The tactile and sensory nature of media like clay or sand provides 'grounding,' which has been scientifically shown to reduce physiological stress markers like cortisol."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "When 'Bridging Projection to Emotional Insight,' when is the most appropriate time for a coach to make a direct link to the child's real life?",
            "options": [
                "In the first five minutes of the first session.",
                "Only after the child has spontaneously made a link or when the metaphor has been fully explored and 'resolved' in play.",
                "Whenever the coach feels bored with the play scenario.",
                "Never; the coach should never mention the child's real life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bridging must be done gently and only when the child is ready. Prematurely 'bursting the bubble' of the metaphor can cause the child to become defensive and stop the therapeutic work."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "In a case study from Lesson 8, a child 'buries' a shark miniature deep under the sand. If the coach uses 'Gentle Inquiry,' which question best fits the projective stance?",
            "options": [
                "'Why did you bury that shark? Are you hiding your anger?'",
                "'Is the shark representational of your father?'",
                "'I wonder if anyone in the sand-world knows that the shark is down there?'",
                "'You shouldn't hide the toys; I can't see what you're doing.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By asking if 'anyone in the sand-world' knows about the shark, the coach stays within the metaphor (the sand-world) while still exploring themes of secrecy, hidden danger, or suppressed emotions."
