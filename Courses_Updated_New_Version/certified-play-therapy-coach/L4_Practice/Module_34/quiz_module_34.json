            "question": "In the context of the 'Group Container' (L1), what is the primary purpose of establishing a 'Holding Environment'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the coach maintains total control over all play behaviors",
                "To create a psychological space where children feel safe enough to take social and emotional risks",
                "To provide a physical storage area for all group play materials",
                "To minimize the amount of time spent on free-play activities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Holding Environment is a psychological and physical space that provides the safety and structure necessary for children to explore social dynamics and emotional expression without fear of judgment or harm."

            "question": "In the S.P.A.R.K. Curriculum Design (L2), what does the 'S' represent, and why is it the foundation of the program?",
            "options": [
                "Socialization; because the goal of groups is to make friends",
                "Storytelling; because every group needs a narrative arc",
                "Safety & Structure; because neurobiological regulation is impossible without perceived safety",
                "Sensory Play; because tactile input is the most important part of play"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety & Structure (S) form the foundation because the brain's social engagement system cannot activate if the child perceives a threat or lacks a predictable structure."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "During Group Attunement (L3), a coach uses 'Scanning' to monitor the group. What is the coach specifically looking for?",
            "options": [
                "Which child is breaking the most rules",
                "The collective 'affective temperature' and individual shifts in engagement or dysregulation",
                "The cleanliness of the play materials during the session",
                "Which child is the designated leader of the group"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scanning involves monitoring the 'affective temperature' of the room to identify when the group as a whole or an individual child is moving out of their window of tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "When implementing Collective Regulation (R) strategies (L4), what is the most effective way to de-escalate a group that is becoming over-stimulated?",
            "options": [
                "Raising your voice to get everyone's attention immediately",
                "Ending the session early and sending everyone home",
                "Using 'Rhythmic Synchrony,' such as a slow, rhythmic drum beat or collective deep breathing",
                "Singling out the most dysregulated child and asking them to leave the circle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rhythmic Synchrony helps align the nervous systems of the group members, using the coach's regulated state to bring the collective back into a window of tolerance."

            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "In Collaborative Projective Play (L5), how does a 'Shared Symbolic Narrative' benefit the group dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "It allows children to process collective trauma or social challenges through a metaphorical lens",
                "It teaches children how to follow a strict script provided by the coach",
                "It ensures that no child uses their own imagination during the session",
                "It is used primarily to determine which child has the best acting skills"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Shared Symbolic Play provides a 'metaphorical distance' that allows children to work through complex social or emotional themes safely within a fictionalized group narrative."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "Kinesthetic Integration (K) in L6 emphasizes 'Heavy Work' activities. What is the neurobiological benefit of these activities for group cohesion?",
            "options": [
                "They tire the children out so they are easier to manage",
                "They provide proprioceptive input that helps ground the nervous system and increase body awareness",
                "They are used as a punishment for children who cannot sit still",
                "They replace the need for verbal communication entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive 'Heavy Work' (pushing, pulling, carrying) helps ground the nervous system, reducing anxiety and making children more available for social connection."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "In Parent-Child Workshop Models (L7), what is the 'Filial' approach primarily focused on?",

                "Teaching parents how to discipline their children more effectively",
                "The coach playing directly with the child while the parent watches from another room",

                "Diagnosing the parent's attachment style in front of the child"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Filial models focus on strengthening the parent-child bond by teaching parents specific play coaching skills to use with their own children."

        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "According to the logistics and scaling guidelines (L8), what is the recommended facilitator-to-child ratio for a therapeutic play group of children with high support needs?",
            "options": [
                "1 facilitator to 10 children",
                "1 facilitator to 3-4 children",
                "2 facilitators to 20 children",
                "1 facilitator to 15 children"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For high-needs groups, a lower ratio (1:3 or 1:4) is essential to ensure safety, allow for individual attunement, and manage potential dysregulation effectively."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "A coach is running a 'S.P.A.R.K.' program and notices two children are fighting over a specific toy. Using the 'P' (Projective Play) strategy from L5, how might the coach intervene?",
            "options": [
                "Taking the toy away and putting both children in time-out",
                "Giving the toy to a third child to show fairness",
                "Introducing a 'Bridge' metaphor, asking how the 'characters' in the play might find a way for both to cross safely",
                "Telling the children that 'real friends don't fight'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using a projective metaphor (like the Bridge) allows the coach to address the conflict within the play's narrative, reducing defensiveness and encouraging collaborative problem-solving."

        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "When scaling a group practice (L8), why is 'Informed Consent' more complex in a group setting than in individual coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Because parents have to sign more papers",
                "Because it must include specific clauses regarding 'Multi-Client Confidentiality' and the limits of privacy in a group",
                "Because it is illegal to run groups without a medical doctor present",
                "It is actually less complex because the group shares one consent form"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In groups, coaches cannot guarantee that other participants will maintain confidentiality, so the informed consent must clearly outline these risks and the expectations for all families involved."
