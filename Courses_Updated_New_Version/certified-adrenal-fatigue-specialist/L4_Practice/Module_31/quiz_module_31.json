            "question": "In Lesson 1, what is cited as the primary advantage of 'Micro-Niching' within the adrenal recovery market?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to charge lower prices to attract more volume",
                "It reduces marketing 'noise' and establishes the coach as a specialist rather than a generalist",
                "It eliminates the need for any scientific background or credentials",
                "It focuses solely on supplements rather than lifestyle interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-niching (e.g., focusing specifically on 'Postpartum Adrenal Depletion' or 'Executive Burnout') allows you to speak directly to a specific audience's pain points, which increases conversion rates and establishes higher perceived authority."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "The R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework for high-ticket offers stands for: Replenish, Evaluate, Sleep, Tension Release, Optimization, Resilience, and ___________.",
            "options": [
                "Eradication of Stress",
                "Endocrine Enhancement",
                "Empowerment & Education",
                "Exogenous Hormone Therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The final 'E' in the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework stands for Empowerment & Education, focusing on giving the client the tools to maintain their HPA axis health long-term without constant supervision."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the most effective 'Authority-Based' content strategy for educating clients about the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "Using complex medical jargon to prove how smart the coach is",
                "Posting daily motivational quotes with no scientific context",
                "Translating complex physiological mechanisms (like the Cortisol Awakening Response) into relatable metaphors",
                "Focusing exclusively on 'before and after' photos of weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Authority is built when a coach can explain complex science in a way that makes the client feel understood and hopeful. Relatable metaphors for HPA axis function bridge the gap between clinical data and the client's lived experience."

        {
            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "When targeting 'Burned-Out Professionals' (Lesson 4), which lead generation approach is typically most successful?",
            "options": [
                "High-energy, high-pressure 'hustle' webinars",
                "Short, high-value 'efficiency' audits or checklists that respect their limited time",
                "Long-form 2-hour video sales letters",
                "Cold-calling executives during business hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burned-out professionals suffer from 'decision fatigue' and time scarcity. Low-friction, high-value assets like a '5-Minute Burnout Audit' are more effective than time-consuming webinars or long videos."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, why is a 'Trauma-Informed' discovery call essential for adrenal fatigue clients?",
            "options": [
                "Because high-pressure sales tactics can trigger a sympathetic 'fight-or-flight' response, causing the client to retreat",
                "Because coaches are legally required to act as licensed therapists",
                "Because it allows the coach to diagnose clinical depression",
                "Because clients with adrenal fatigue are usually not interested in buying anything"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clients with HPA axis dysregulation are often in a state of hyper-vigilance. Aggressive sales tactics (scarcity, pressure) trigger their stress response, which is counter-productive to the healing relationship you are trying to build."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "When leveraging testimonials (Lesson 6), what is the most 'clinically persuasive' way to present a success story?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing only on the amount of weight the client lost",
                "Pairing subjective improvements (energy levels) with objective markers (e.g., 'Normalizing 4-point salivary cortisol patterns')",
                "Using only the client's first name and no specific details",
                "Claiming the program 'cures' Addison's Disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most powerful testimonials for a specialist practice combine the 'feeling' (subjective) with the 'finding' (objective). Mentioning clinical markers like salivary cortisol patterns builds significant credibility with skeptical prospects."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, what is the 'Win-Win-Win' model for referral partnerships with Functional Medicine (FM) practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "The coach pays the doctor a kickback for every referral",
                "The doctor handles the diagnosis/labs, the coach handles the intensive lifestyle implementation, and the client gets better results",
                "The coach takes over the doctor's entire practice",
                "The doctor provides free supplements to the coach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Win-Win-Win' occurs when the doctor saves time, the coach gets a steady stream of qualified leads, and the client receives the comprehensive 'high-touch' support that doctors often cannot provide in a clinical setting."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the primary indicator that a practice is ready to scale from 1-on-1 coaching to a group model?",
            "options": [
                "When the coach has zero clients and needs more money",
                "When the coach is spending more than 25 hours a week repeating the same foundational HPA axis education to different individuals",
                "When the coach decides they no longer want to talk to people",
                "When the coach's website traffic reaches 1 million hits per month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Repetition of foundational content is a sign of inefficiency. Moving those 'educational' components to a group or digital format allows the coach to scale their impact without increasing their 1-on-1 time."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "A 2023 practice management study cited in the module found that specialists who utilize 'Value-Based Pricing' instead of 'Hourly Billing' saw what average increase in client commitment?",
            "options": [
                "No increase; clients prefer hourly billing",
                "A 15% decrease in commitment",
                "A 40% increase in protocol adherence and completion rates",
                "Commitment only increases if the price is under $50 per session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket, value-based pricing (charging for the outcome/transformation) increases 'skin in the game.' Clients who invest more are statistically more likely to follow through on lifestyle changes and complete the protocol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'red flag' to avoid in your marketing materials to stay compliant with ASI standards?",
            "options": [
                "Using the term 'HPA Axis Dysregulation' instead of 'Adrenal Fatigue'",
                "Describing yourself as an 'Adrenal Fatigue Specialist'",
                "Guaranteeing a '100% cure for adrenal burnout in 30 days'",
                "Sharing educational content about the role of Vitamin C in adrenal health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Guaranteeing a 'cure' or a specific timeframe for healing is an ethical and legal violation. Adrenal recovery is highly individual and non-linear; marketing should focus on 'support,' 'recovery,' and 'optimization' rather than 'cures.'"
