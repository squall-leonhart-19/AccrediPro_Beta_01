            "question": "When transitioning from 1:1 coaching to a group model, what is the primary clinical benefit for clients suffering from HPA-axis dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "Reduced cost of supplements through group buying power",
                "Mitigation of social isolation and the 'normalization' of symptoms through community support",
                "Increased frequency of 1-on-1 time with the lead practitioner",
                "Faster laboratory turnaround times for cortisol testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adrenal fatigue patients often feel isolated and misunderstood. Group coaching provides community validation, which reduces the stress of isolation and can lower perceived cortisol triggers."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket masterminds focus on transformation (the result) rather than information (the content). Overloading adrenal clients with too much information can actually increase their stress and HPA-axis load."

                "1:6; Healthy (The client is worth 6x what it cost to acquire them)",

                "1:2; Healthy (Any profit is good profit)",

            "explanation": "An LTV:CAC ratio of 1:6 (or 6:1 depending on notation, but specifically meaning LTV is 6x CAC) is very healthy. A ratio of 3:1 is generally considered the benchmark for a sustainable growing business."
