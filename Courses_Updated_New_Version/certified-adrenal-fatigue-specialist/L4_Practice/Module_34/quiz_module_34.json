            "question": "In the context of HPA axis recovery, why is 'co-regulation' considered a primary benefit of group programs?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to work with more people at once, increasing revenue.",
                "The presence of a regulated leader and supportive peers activates mirror neurons, helping to shift participants into a parasympathetic state.",
                "It creates a competitive environment that encourages faster healing through social pressure.",
                "It reduces the need for individualized supplement protocols by 50%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation is a biological process where one person's nervous system influences another's. In group healing, the coach's regulated state and the group's collective safety help entrain the individual's HPA axis toward balance."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When mapping the RESTORE Method™ to a group format, which phase must be prioritized in the first 2 weeks to ensure program adherence?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Optimizing' phase for high-intensity biohacking.",
                "The 'Rebuilding' phase for heavy nutrient supplementation.",
                "The 'Release' phase, focusing on strategic withdrawal from stressors and nervous system down-regulation.",
                "The 'Triumph' phase, which focuses on long-term maintenance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To prevent overwhelming an already exhausted HPA axis, the 'Release' phase is critical. Starting with high-intensity changes can trigger a 'crash,' leading to high dropout rates in group settings."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "For a 90-minute 'Adrenal Intensive' workshop, what is the recommended 'Facilitation Ratio' to ensure maximum transformation without causing cognitive fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "10% Teaching / 90% Q&A",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adrenal fatigue clients often suffer from brain fog and low cognitive endurance. A 30/70 split ensures they are 'doing' rather than just 'listening,' which improves retention and prevents nervous system overload."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "A participant begins 'trauma dumping' during a live group session, potentially triggering other members. What is the most professional facilitation response?",
            "options": [
                "Allow them to continue until they feel heard, as suppression causes stress.",
                "Interrupt immediately and tell them they are being inappropriate.",
                "Use the 'Bridge and Boundary' technique: Acknowledge the emotion, validate the experience, and pivot to a structured group exercise or 1-on-1 follow-up.",
                "Mute the participant and continue with the slide deck."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Bridge and Boundary' technique maintains the safety of the group container while ensuring the individual feels seen without derailing the session for others."

            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "When selecting a 'Tech Stack' for a scalable adrenal recovery program, why is an asynchronous community platform (like Circle or Mighty Networks) preferred over a Facebook Group?",
            "options": [
                "It is always cheaper for the coach.",
                "It removes the distraction of social media algorithms and 'doom-scrolling,' which are detrimental to HPA axis health.",
                "It allows for better targeted advertising to the participants.",
                "Facebook Groups do not allow for video hosting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HPA axis recovery requires reducing digital noise. Private community platforms provide a 'sanctuary' environment free from the dopamine-loop triggers found on traditional social media."

                "There is no warm-up needed if the price is under $500."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout clients are often hesitant and suffer from decision fatigue. A 4-6 week runway allows for gradual trust-building and education before asking them to commit to a program."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "In the 'Hybrid Scaling Model,' how is 'Program Sustainability' primarily achieved?",
            "options": [
                "By removing all live interaction to save the coach's energy.",
                "By requiring participants to buy all supplements through the coach.",
                "By combining pre-recorded 'Foundational' modules with high-impact, weekly live 'Integration' calls.",
                "By hiring unqualified assistants to handle all client communication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid model provides the efficiency of evergreen content (scalability) with the essential 'human' element of live coaching (efficacy), preventing coach burnout while maintaining results."

            "options": [
                "The number of yoga poses participants will learn.",
                "The reduction in 'Presenteeism' (working while sick/unproductive) and associated healthcare costs.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Corporations make decisions based on ROI. Presenteeism costs businesses significantly more than absenteeism; demonstrating how your program restores productivity is the most effective sales angle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frequent, short 'Vagal Breaks' prevent the cumulative stress of a long workshop from pushing participants into a sympathetic 'fight or flight' state, ensuring they remain in the 'Learning Zone.'"

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Founding Member' launch strategy for a new adrenal program?",
            "options": [
                "To charge the highest price possible to early adopters.",
                "To hide the fact that the curriculum isn't finished yet.",
                "To gather testimonials, refine the curriculum based on real-time feedback, and generate initial social proof.",
