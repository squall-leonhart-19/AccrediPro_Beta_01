            "question": "In the context of rebuilding resilience, how is 'allostatic load' best defined?",
            "options": [
                "A state of perfect internal balance achieved through meditation",
                "The cumulative wear and tear on the body due to chronic over-activation of adaptive systems",
                "The body's ability to maintain a stable core temperature during exercise",
                "The immediate, acute spike in cortisol following a single stressful event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the physiological 'cost' of chronic exposure to fluctuating or elevated neural or neuroendocrine responses that result from repeated or chronic stress."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "The principle of hormesis suggests that a stressor provides a beneficial biological response under which condition?",
            "options": [
                "When the stressor is applied continuously without any recovery periods",
                "When the dose is low enough to trigger cellular adaptation without overwhelming repair mechanisms",
                "When the stressor is purely psychological and involves no physical component",
                "When the stressor is intense enough to completely suppress the HPA axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormesis follows a biphasic dose-response curve where low doses of a stressor (like exercise or heat) stimulate beneficial adaptations, while high doses cause damage."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "During the 'Movement as Medicine' phase (L3), which symptom is a primary contraindication for progressing to higher intensity exercise?",
            "options": [

                "A resting heart rate that remains stable compared to the previous day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) indicates that the exercise volume or intensity has exceeded the client's current allostatic capacity, requiring a return to restorative movement."

            "id": "q6_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A conservative 5-10% weekly increase in volume allows the HPA axis and mitochondrial function to adapt without triggering a relapse into fatigue."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological benefit of 'Heat Shock Proteins' (HSPs) triggered during controlled sauna use (L5)?",
            "options": [
                "They actively lower blood glucose levels to induce ketosis",
                "They act as molecular chaperones to repair misfolded proteins and protect cellular integrity",
                "They permanently shut down the adrenal medulla to prevent adrenaline spikes",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heat Shock Proteins are part of the hormetic response to thermal stress; they help stabilize and repair proteins, enhancing cellular resilience."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "In psychological resilience training (L6), what does 'Cognitive Reframing' involve for an adrenal fatigue client?",

                "Ignoring all physical symptoms and practicing 'toxic positivity'",
                "Changing the 'stress-is-debilitating' mindset to a 'stress-is-enhancing' mindset where appropriate",

                "Developing a rigid schedule that allows for no flexibility or changes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing involves viewing stressors as challenges or data points rather than threats, which changes the neuroendocrine response to those stressors."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Which fasting protocol is considered safest for a client with metabolic inflexibility who is still in the 'Rebuild' phase (L7)?",

                "Fasting only on days when performing high-intensity interval training (HIIT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Crescendo fasting provides the hormetic benefit of fasting without the excessive cortisol demand that daily or extended fasting can place on a recovering system."

                "A state of deep metabolic flexibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) score indicates low heart rate variability, signaling sympathetic dominance and insufficient recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cold exposure can increase norepinephrine by up to 200-300%, which aids in focus, mood regulation, and metabolic rate without overtaxing the adrenals if dosed correctly."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If the workout is tolerated but energy crashes elsewhere, the coach must look at the total allostatic load (work, life, diet) and how blood sugar is managed throughout the day."
