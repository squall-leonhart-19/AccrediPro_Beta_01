            "question": "In the mechanics of the HPA Axis, which signaling hormone is released by the hypothalamus to stimulate the anterior pituitary gland?",
            "options": [
                "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The hypothalamus initiates the stress response by releasing Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH), which then signals the pituitary gland to release ACTH."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study demonstrated that individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher were how much more likely to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The spigot represents the body's ability to drain the bucket through recovery, detoxification, and stress management; if the spigot is clogged, the bucket overflows faster."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates a flexible autonomic nervous system and strong vagal tone, suggesting the body is effectively transitioning into a 'rest and digest' state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic systemic inflammation (marked by CRP) often leads to a 'blunted' CAR, where the body fails to produce the necessary morning rise in cortisol to meet daily demands."
