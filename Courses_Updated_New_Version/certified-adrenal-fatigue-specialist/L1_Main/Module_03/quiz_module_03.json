            "question": "According to the 'Blood Sugar-Cortisol Connection,' why does hypoglycemia trigger a stress response in the body?",
            "options": [
                "Low blood sugar inhibits the production of ACTH in the pituitary.",
                "Cortisol is a glucocorticoid that must be secreted to mobilize glucose from the liver via gluconeogenesis.",
                "Insulin and cortisol work synergistically to lower blood glucose during periods of fasting.",
                "The adrenal glands require high levels of glucose to synthesize adrenaline."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol's primary metabolic role is to maintain blood glucose. When blood sugar drops too low, the adrenals must secrete cortisol to trigger gluconeogenesis (the creation of new glucose) to protect the brain."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "What is the recommended macronutrient distribution for the 'Adrenal Recovery Plate' to ensure sustained energy and hormonal precursor availability?",
            "options": [
                "60% Carbohydrates, 20% Protein, 20% Fat",
                "10% Carbohydrates, 45% Protein, 45% Fat",
                "30% Complex Carbohydrates, 30% High-Quality Protein, 40% Healthy Fats",
                "50% Complex Carbohydrates, 40% Protein, 10% Fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Adrenal Recovery Plate prioritizes healthy fats (40%) to provide cholesterol for hormone synthesis, while balancing protein and complex carbs (30% each) to stabilize blood sugar."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which physiological fact highlights the importance of Vitamin C in adrenal health?",
            "options": [
                "The adrenal glands contain the highest concentration of Vitamin C of any organ in the human body.",
                "Vitamin C is the primary precursor to the hormone aldosterone.",
                "The adrenals can synthesize their own Vitamin C from glucose during times of high stress.",
                "Vitamin C is required to transport cortisol across the blood-brain barrier."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The adrenal glands have a Vitamin C concentration up to 100 times higher than that of the plasma, as it is a vital cofactor for both the production of cortisol and catecholamines."

            "question": "In Lesson 4, Magnesium is described as the 'HPA Axis Brake.' What is the mechanism behind this?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium increases the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to CRH.",
                "Magnesium blocks NMDA receptors in the brain, reducing excitatory neurotransmission and lowering HPA activity.",
                "Magnesium stimulates the release of adrenaline to counter-regulate cortisol.",
                "Magnesium binds to cortisol in the blood, making it inactive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker and NMDA receptor antagonist, which prevents the nervous system from becoming over-excited and helps modulate the stress response."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A client in Stage 3 Adrenal Fatigue presents with significant salt cravings and low blood pressure. Which hormonal imbalance is likely responsible?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive cortisol causing sodium retention.",
                "Low levels of aldosterone leading to 'sodium wasting' in the kidneys.",
                "High potassium levels causing a suppressive effect on the pituitary gland.",
                "Elevated DHEA levels increasing the excretion of sodium."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aldosterone, produced in the adrenal cortex, regulates sodium and potassium. When the adrenals are exhausted, aldosterone drops, causing the kidneys to excrete too much sodium, leading to cravings and low blood pressure."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which amino acid is particularly crucial for clients with 'Tired but Wired' evening energy due to its role as a precursor to GABA?",
            "options": [
                "L-Tyrosine",
                "L-Theanine",
                "L-Glutamine",
                "L-Phenylalanine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While L-Theanine is helpful, L-Glutamine serves as a precursor to GABA, the body's primary inhibitory (calming) neurotransmitter, which helps modulate the evening cortisol surge."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Why are Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) considered essential for the 'Support Nutrition' phase of adrenal recovery?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the production of inflammatory prostaglandins to stimulate the adrenals.",
                "They provide the raw material for cortisol synthesis.",
                "They sensitize cortisol receptors and reduce the inflammatory cytokines that overstimulate the HPA axis.",
                "They prevent the absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory. By reducing systemic inflammation, they lower the 'demand' for cortisol, allowing the adrenal glands to rest and recover."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Regarding 'Circadian Nutrition,' what is the 'Adrenal Window' for consuming breakfast to prevent an early morning cortisol spike?",
            "options": [
                "Within 3 hours of waking.",
                "Immediately upon waking, preferably before 6:00 AM.",
                "Within 30 to 60 minutes of waking.",
                "At least 2 hours after the first cup of coffee."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eating within 30-60 minutes of waking provides the body with the glucose it needs, preventing the adrenals from having to 'spike' cortisol to mobilize energy for the morning's activities."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client reports waking up at 3:00 AM with a racing heart and inability to fall back asleep. What nutritional intervention is most appropriate based on Module 3 concepts?",
            "options": [
                "A high-protein, moderate-fat snack (like almond butter on a small piece of apple) before bed.",
                "Intermittent fasting, ensuring the last meal is at 4:00 PM.",
                "A high-carbohydrate snack (like a bowl of cereal) immediately before bed.",
                "Drinking 16oz of water with lemon upon waking at 3:00 AM."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Night waking at 3:00 AM is often caused by nocturnal hypoglycemia. A small protein/fat snack before bed stabilizes blood sugar throughout the night, preventing the 3:00 AM cortisol/adrenaline surge."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which B-vitamin is known as the 'Anti-Stress' vitamin because it is a vital component of Coenzyme A, required for energy production in the adrenal cortex?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)",
                "Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)",
                "Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)",
                "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) is essential for the production of adrenal hormones and the conversion of glucose into energy. Deficiency is directly linked to adrenal atrophy in animal studies."
