            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which specific region of the hypothalamus acts as the 'command center' for the HPA axis by secreting Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) in response to perceived stress?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventromedial Nucleus",
                "The Paraventricular Nucleus (PVN)",
                "The Arcuate Nucleus",
                "The Dorsomedial Nucleus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Paraventricular Nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus contains the neuroendocrine neurons that synthesize and secrete CRH, initiating the HPA axis cascade."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A healthy Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is characterized by what percentage increase in cortisol levels within 30 to 45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",
                "25-40%",
                "50-75%",
                "Over 150%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A robust and healthy CAR is defined by a 50-75% increase over the waking value, representing the body's 'stress-test' and preparation for the day's demands."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "In the context of metabolic stress, why does chronic HPA axis activation often lead to central adiposity (belly fat)?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol inhibits lipoprotein lipase in visceral fat cells.",
                "Cortisol promotes peripheral insulin sensitivity while lowering blood glucose.",
                "Cortisol increases gluconeogenesis and promotes insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, while visceral fat has a high density of glucocorticoid receptors.",
                "Cortisol suppresses the production of insulin from the pancreas entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cortisol ensures the brain has glucose by creating peripheral insulin resistance and stimulating gluconeogenesis; visceral fat is highly sensitive to cortisol, leading to fat storage in the midsection."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the nervous system is responsible for 'Social Engagement' and acts as a biological brake on the HPA axis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the 'smart' vagus that promotes safety, connection, and down-regulates the sympathetic fight-or-flight response."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "The Glymphatic system, responsible for clearing metabolic waste from the brain, is most active during which state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glymphatic clearance increases by up to 60% during deep N3 sleep, a process that is inhibited by high levels of norepinephrine and cortisol."

            "question": "A client with 'Adrenal Exhaustion' (low flat curve) attempts a 60-minute heavy weightlifting session. Based on the principle of Hormesis, what is the likely outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Positive adaptation and increased mitochondrial density.",
                "The stressor exceeds the client's current 'Adaptive Capacity,' leading to further HPA dysregulation and systemic inflammation.",

                "Improved insulin sensitivity that offsets the lack of cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormesis requires the stressor to be within the organism's recovery window. If the stressor (intense exercise) exceeds adaptive capacity, it becomes toxic rather than therapeutic."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In the 'Vitality Mindset' framework, what is 'Cognitive Appraisal'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive appraisal determines the physiological response; viewing a stressor as a 'challenge' can trigger a healthy DHEA response, whereas viewing it as a 'threat' triggers a pure cortisol/alarm response."

            "id": "q11_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 (Regulate) focuses on the foundations: aligning the client with light/dark cycles and moving the nervous system out of a chronic 'threat' state."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Research indicates that a 'flat' diurnal cortisol curve (low morning, high/normal evening) is most strongly correlated with which clinical outcome?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flattened diurnal slope is a hallmark of advanced HPA dysregulation and is statistically linked to poor metabolic health and increased mortality in chronic disease."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Tired but Wired' symptoms: low energy in the morning but a surge of energy at 10:00 PM. Which clinical integration strategy is most appropriate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Tired but Wired' pattern indicates a circadian mismatch. Anchoring the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) with morning light and evening darkness is the primary intervention for shifting the diurnal curve."
