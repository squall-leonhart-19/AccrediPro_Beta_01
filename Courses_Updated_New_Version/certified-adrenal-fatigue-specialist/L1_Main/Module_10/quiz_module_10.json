            "question": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™, what does the first 'R' represent, and why is it the foundational step?",
            "options": [
                "Recognize Stressors; because you cannot heal what you haven't identified as a drain on allostatic load.",
                "Restorative Sleep; because recovery cannot happen without the glymphatic system being active.",
                "Rebuild Resilience; because the adrenals need to be challenged immediately to regain function.",
                "Regulate Rhythms; because cortisol must be balanced before any other intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The first step in the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™ is Recognize Stressors. Identifying the total allostatic load—including hidden biological stressors—is essential before applying physiological supports."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the cumulative cost to the body of adapting to chronic stressors, leading to systemic degradation when the adaptive capacity is exceeded."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "To normalize a blunted Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) in a client with 'flat' morning levels, which 'Establish Rhythms' intervention is most evidence-based?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Morning light exposure is the primary zeitgeber (time-giver) for the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which triggers the HPA axis to produce the CAR."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Why is glycemic control considered a 'non-negotiable' in the 'Support Nutrition' phase of adrenal recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin is the only hormone that can synthesize cortisol.",
                "Hypoglycemia acts as a potent metabolic stressor that triggers mandatory cortisol and adrenaline release.",
                "High protein diets are toxic to the adrenal cortex.",
                "The adrenals require glucose to store Vitamin C."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blood sugar drops (hypoglycemia) are perceived by the brain as a survival threat, forcing the adrenals to pump out cortisol to mobilize stored glucose, further exhausting the gland."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms and a high resting heart rate. Which somatic tool from the 'Tame the Nervous System' lesson would be most appropriate to increase Vagal Tone?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations stimulate the Vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nervous system, helping to shift the body out of a sympathetic-dominant state."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "The 'Optimize Rest' phase emphasizes the Glymphatic System. What is the primary function of this system during Stage 3 (Deep) sleep?",

                "Hormetic stress is always psychological, while distress is always physical.",
                "Hormetic stress is a controlled, acute challenge that triggers an adaptive, strengthening response.",
                "Distress is shorter in duration than hormetic stress.",
                "There is no difference; all stress is damaging to the adrenals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormesis follows a U-shaped dose-response curve where low doses of a stressor (like cold exposure or sauna) stimulate beneficial adaptations and cellular repair."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "When a client reaches the 'Empower Vitality' stage, what is the significance of the '80/20 Rule' in maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "The client should spend 80% of their day sleeping.",
                "80% of the diet should be supplements, and 20% should be food.",
                "Maintaining 80% consistency with recovery habits allows for 20% flexibility without causing a full relapse.",
                "80% of stressors are internal, and 20% are external."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule in the maintenance phase promotes long-term sustainability by allowing for life's unpredictability while keeping core health 'non-negotiables' in place."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is a critical cofactor for both the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones (steroidogenesis) and the production of catecholamines in the adrenal medulla?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin K2",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Calcium Carbonate",
                "Vitamin E"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is found in higher concentrations in the adrenal glands than any other organ, serving as a vital cofactor for hormone production and an antioxidant to protect the glands."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client reports waking up at 3:00 AM with a racing heart and anxiety. Based on Module 10's 'Establish Rhythms' and 'Support Nutrition' lessons, what is the likely clinical cause?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive melatonin production at night",
                "A nocturnal glucose crash triggering a compensatory surge of adrenaline/cortisol",

                "Normal circadian rhythm behavior for Stage 3 Adrenal Fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "3:00 AM wake-ups are a classic sign of nocturnal hypoglycemia. When blood sugar drops too low, the body releases 'emergency' hormones (adrenaline/cortisol) to raise it, which also wakes the person up in a panicked state."
