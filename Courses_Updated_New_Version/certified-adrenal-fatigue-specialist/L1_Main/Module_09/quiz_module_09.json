            "question": "A client presents with a 'blunted' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), showing less than a 50% increase in cortisol 30 minutes after waking. According to Lesson 1, what does this most likely indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Acute high-stress response (hypercortisolism)",
                "Optimal HPA axis flexibility and resilience",
                "HPA axis exhaustion or a breakdown in the hippocampus-adrenal signaling",
                "Excessive intake of dietary sodium in the evening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR should see a 50-75% rise in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking; a blunted response is a hallmark of chronic HPA axis dysregulation and hippocampal signaling issues."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "To effectively entrain the circadian rhythm using 'Chrono-Habits,' what is the minimum recommended light intensity (lux) a client should be exposed to within 60 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "500 lux (standard office lighting)",
                "1,000 lux (cloudy day through a window)",
                "10,000 lux (direct sunlight or a therapeutic light box)",
                "50,000 lux (midday summer sun only)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 highlights that approximately 10,000 lux is required to suppress melatonin effectively and trigger the cortisol spike needed for circadian alignment."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, which nutrient is described as having the highest concentration in the adrenal glands compared to any other organ, serving as a critical cofactor for steroidogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium",
                "Zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The adrenal glands maintain a Vitamin C concentration up to 100 times higher than that of the plasma, as it is essential for the production of cortisol and catecholamines."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 4), which state is characterized by the 'Social Engagement System' and is the primary goal of Vagus Nerve regulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' branch of the nervous system that allows for recovery, digestion, and HPA axis down-regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "The Glymphatic system, responsible for clearing metabolic waste from the brain, is found to be up to 60% more active during which specific stage of sleep?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research cited in Lesson 5 shows that the expansion of the interstitial space and CSF flow (glymphatic clearance) occurs primarily during N3 deep sleep."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "A client in 'Phase 3: Exhaustion' wants to start doing daily 20-minute ice baths (Hormesis). Based on Lesson 6, what is the most appropriate clinical recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage it, as cold exposure immediately boosts adrenal output.",
                "Advise against it, as the client lacks the 'adaptive reserve' to benefit from high-intensity hormetic stress.",
                "Suggest doing it only at night to help with sleep architecture.",
                "Replace all cardio with cold plunging to save glycogen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormesis requires a 'Goldilocks' dose; clients in advanced exhaustion often suffer a 'maladaptive response' to intense stressors like cold plunging, potentially worsening their condition."

            "id": "q9_7",

            "options": [
                "Adopting a 'Stress-is-Debilitating' mindset",
                "Shifting from an Internal to an External Locus of Control",
                "Developing 'Stress-is-Enhancing' perception and cognitive reframing",
                "Suppressing all negative emotions to maintain a positive state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perceiving stress as a challenge rather than a threat (Stress-is-Enhancing) has been shown to modulate the DHEA:Cortisol ratio favorably."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "When mapping a protocol (Lesson 8), why is it critical to stabilize blood sugar BEFORE introducing stimulating adaptogens like Rhodiola?",
            "options": [
                "Rhodiola causes immediate hypoglycemia in all clients.",
                "Blood sugar instability acts as a constant internal 'occult stressor' that can negate the benefits of adaptogens.",
                "Adaptogens only work when insulin levels are above 10 uIU/mL.",
                "Rhodiola requires glucose to cross the blood-brain barrier."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dysglycemia is a primary driver of HPA axis activation; if the internal 'fire' of blood sugar swings isn't put out first, adaptogens will have limited efficacy."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Lesson 1 discusses 'Hidden Stressors.' If a client's cortisol remains high despite perfect lifestyle habits and sleep, which 'occult' factor should be investigated first?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of high-intensity interval training",
                "Chronic subclinical infections (e.g., gut dysbiosis or mycotoxins)",
                "Insufficient intake of dietary fiber",
                "Low levels of environmental blue light"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological 'hidden' stressors like mold, parasites, or gut infections provide a constant inflammatory signal to the HPA axis that lifestyle changes alone cannot resolve."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In Clinical Integration (Lesson 8), what is the '3-Day Rule' for protocol adjustments?",
            "options": [
                "Wait 3 days before changing any supplement to observe for acute sensitivity.",
                "Clients must fast for 3 days before starting any adrenal protocol.",
                "The HPA axis takes exactly 3 days to reset its feedback loop.",
                "Exercise should be limited to once every 3 days."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 3-day rule is a clinical safety standard to ensure that any negative reactions to a new intervention are identified before adding more variables to the protocol."
