            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™ focuses on the sequential regulation of the HPA axis, moving from recognizing stressors to establishing rhythms and rebuilding resilience to restore the natural feedback loop."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bright light exposure triggers the melanopsin receptors in the retina, which signals the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) to stimulate the adrenal glands for a healthy CAR."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypoglycemia is a potent activator of the HPA axis; maintaining stable blood sugar prevents the body from needing to use cortisol as a gluconeogenic tool to raise glucose."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Removing blue light (Digital Sunset) prevents the suppression of melatonin, allowing the body's natural sleep-wake cycle to take over and reducing evening cortisol spikes."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course indicates that chronic 'micro-stressors' (daily hassles) have a higher correlation with HPA dysfunction than single acute events. This emphasizes the need for:",
