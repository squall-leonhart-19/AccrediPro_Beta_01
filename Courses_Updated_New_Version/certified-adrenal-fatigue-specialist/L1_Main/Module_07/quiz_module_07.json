            "question": "In the Philosophy of Sustainable Vitality, what is the primary distinction between 'Performance' and 'Vitality'?",
            "options": [
                "Performance focuses on output at any cost; Vitality focuses on the physiological capacity to sustain output.",
                "Performance is only for athletes; Vitality is for clinical patients.",
                "Performance is measured by cortisol levels; Vitality is measured by DHEA levels.",
                "There is no distinction; they are used interchangeably in the AccrediPro methodology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sustainable Vitality shifts the focus from short-term output (Performance) to the long-term physiological capacity and resilience of the HPA axis (Vitality)."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Which proactive HPA protection strategy involves scheduling 15-30 minute 'white space' periods between high-demand cognitive tasks?",
            "options": [
                "The Cortisol Sandwich",
                "Cognitive Buffer Zones",
                "Metabolic Flexibility Windows",
                "The 90-Minute Ultradian Reset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Buffer Zones prevent the 'stacking' of stressors, allowing the HPA axis to return to baseline between demanding tasks rather than maintaining a state of chronic activation."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to Habit Architecture principles, why is an 'Identity Shift' more effective than 'Outcome-Based' goals for adrenal recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Identity shifts require less willpower.",
                "Outcome-based goals cause a spike in adrenaline that hinders recovery.",
                "Identity shifts align behavior with the self-concept of being a 'Vital Person' rather than someone 'trying to get healthy.'",
                "Identity shifts are processed in the prefrontal cortex while outcomes are processed in the amygdala."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client shifts their identity (e.g., 'I am someone who honors my energy'), their daily habits become an expression of who they are, significantly increasing long-term adherence compared to chasing a specific health metric."

                "Incomplete 'open loops' and micro-stressors that occupy subconscious processing.",
                "Overtraining in the gym without proper supplementation.",
                "A diet high in processed sugars."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Silent energy leaks are often psychological or administrative 'open loops'—unresolved tasks or micro-stressors that keep the nervous system in a state of low-grade vigilance."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "For Environmental Mastery, what is the recommended minimum light intensity (in Lux) for morning circadian anchoring to support cortisol awakening response (CAR)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that exposure to approximately 10,000 Lux for 20-30 minutes in the morning is optimal for anchoring the circadian rhythm and supporting a healthy CAR."

            "question": "A client reports 'early morning waking' (waking at 3:00 AM or 4:00 AM and unable to return to sleep). According to Relapse Prevention, this is usually a red flag for:",
            "options": [
                "A drop in melatonin production.",
                "A nocturnal glucose drop triggering a compensatory cortisol/adrenaline spike.",
                "Excessive deep sleep in the first half of the night.",
                "A deficiency in Vitamin D3."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early morning waking is a classic 'Red Flag' indicating that the HPA axis is over-reacting to a drop in blood sugar, signaling a potential relapse into adrenal dysregulation."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Which neurochemical acts as a direct 'HPA Axis Brake' by inhibiting the release of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine",
                "Epinephrine",

                "Glutamate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, often called the 'bonding hormone,' has a direct inhibitory effect on the hypothalamus, reducing the secretion of CRH and lowering the overall stress response."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In the Lifetime Vitality Roadmap, what does the concept of 'Wintering' entail?",
            "options": [
                "Using cold thermogenesis to boost metabolic rate.",
                "A planned seasonal phase of reduced social/professional output and increased restorative practices.",
                "Relocating to a colder climate to reduce inflammation.",
                "Increasing caloric intake to support adrenal hormone synthesis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wintering is a strategic period of 'deep rest' that mirrors the natural seasons, allowing the HPA axis to fully recharge and preventing the 'burnout-recovery' cycle."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client has successfully recovered but begins to experience 'wired but tired' energy in the evenings after starting a new project. What is the recommended 'Relapse Prevention' protocol?",

                "Ignoring the symptom unless it persists for more than 30 days."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'wired but tired' state is a Tier 1 Red Flag. The protocol is an immediate 48-hour reset to prevent the nervous system from locking into a state of sympathetic dominance."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Research on habit architecture suggests that 'Environment Design' (changing the physical surroundings) is more effective for HPA health than willpower because:",
            "options": [
                "Willpower is a finite resource that is often depleted in adrenal fatigue patients.",
                "Environment design only works for younger clients.",
                "Willpower increases cortisol, while environment design lowers it.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Adrenal fatigue patients often suffer from 'decision fatigue.' Environment design removes the need for willpower, making healthy choices the path of least resistance."
