            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The body initiates sleep by dilating blood vessels in the hands and feet (distal vasodilation) to release heat, which lowers the core body temperature."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Early morning light exposure (within 30 minutes of waking) is the most powerful zeitgeber for anchoring the circadian rhythm and setting the timer for melatonin release 14-16 hours later."
