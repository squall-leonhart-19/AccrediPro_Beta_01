            "question": "Why is the term 'Adrenal Fatigue' considered clinically inaccurate in modern endocrinology?",
            "options": [
                "The adrenal glands physically shrink and disappear over time.",
                "The adrenal glands typically maintain the capacity to produce cortisol, but the central signaling (HPA axis) becomes dysregulated.",
                "Cortisol production is always high in stressed individuals, never low.",
                "The issue is exclusively related to the thyroid gland rather than the adrenals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that 'adrenal fatigue' is a misnomer; the glands rarely 'fail.' Instead, the HPA axis downregulates its signaling (HPA axis dysregulation) as an adaptive response to chronic stress."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™, what is the primary focus of the 'Establish Rhythms' (E) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating all caffeine from the diet.",
                "Aligning the body's internal clock with natural light cycles and optimizing the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR).",
                "Increasing the intensity of cardiovascular exercise.",
                "Focusing on emotional release through journaling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establish Rhythms focuses on circadian biology, specifically using light exposure and consistent timing to reset the HPA axis and the CAR."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Which concept from the Bio-Psycho-Social model refers to the 'cumulative wear and tear' on the body resulting from chronic overactivation of adaptive systems?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load describes the physiological price the body pays for being forced to adapt to adverse psychosocial or physical situations."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A healthy Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is typically defined by a cortisol increase of how much within the first 30-45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "No increase; cortisol should be highest at midnight.",
                "A 50% to 75% increase over waking levels.",
                "A 10% decrease to prepare for the day.",
                "A 500% increase to maximize alertness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A robust CAR (50-75% increase) is a marker of HPA axis resilience and predicts better cognitive function and emotional regulation throughout the day."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Why is blood sugar stability a 'non-negotiable' in Lesson 5 (Support Nutrition) for adrenal recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) acts as a potent HPA axis trigger, forcing the adrenals to secrete cortisol to raise glucose levels.",
                "High blood sugar directly dissolves cortisol molecules in the bloodstream.",
                "Insulin is the only hormone that can repair adrenal tissue.",
                "Sugar is the only fuel source the adrenal glands can use."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The brain perceives low blood sugar as a survival threat, triggering a 'glucocortocoid' response (cortisol) to mobilize glucose, which further exhausts HPA signaling."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 6), which state is the goal for HPA axis 'taming' and social connection?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Fight-or-Flight",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",
                "Ventral Vagal State",
                "The Freeze Response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safety and connection' system that allows the HPA axis to remain in a state of rest and repair."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "The Glymphatic System, discussed in Lesson 7, is responsible for clearing metabolic waste from the brain. When is it most active?",
            "options": [
                "During high-intensity interval training (HIIT).",
                "During Deep Slow-Wave Sleep (N3 stage).",
                "During the afternoon cortisol dip.",
                "Immediately after consuming a high-protein meal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is primarily active during deep sleep, where brain cells shrink slightly to allow cerebrospinal fluid to flush out toxins like beta-amyloid."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Rebuild & Empower' (R/E) phase in the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™?",
            "options": [
                "To maintain a bubble of zero stress for the rest of the client's life.",
                "To transition the client from 'recovery mode' to 'resilience mode' using controlled hormetic stressors.",
                "To stop all nutritional supplementation.",
                "To focus exclusively on weight loss through calorie restriction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Once the HPA axis is stable, the R/E phase introduces hormetic stress (like temperature therapy or specific exercise) to build long-term physiological 'armor' and vitality."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is found in its highest concentration in the adrenal glands and is rapidly depleted during the 'alarm' phase of stress?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The adrenal glands have the highest concentration of Vitamin C in the body, as it is a required cofactor for both catecholamine and cortisol synthesis."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms at night. Which 'bottom-up' intervention from Lesson 6 would be most immediately effective?",
            "options": [
                "Analyzing childhood traumas to find the root cause.",
                "Practicing the 'Physiological Sigh' (double inhale, long exhale) to increase vagal tone.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The physiological sigh is a 'bottom-up' tool that uses the breath to mechanically signal the brain to shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance."
