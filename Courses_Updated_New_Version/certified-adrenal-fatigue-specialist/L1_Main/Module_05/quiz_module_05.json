            "question": "During which stage of sleep does the 'glymphatic system' become most active, clearing metabolic waste and beta-amyloid plaques from the brain?",
            "options": [
                "Stage 1 (N1) Light Sleep",
                "Stage 2 (N2) Sleep Spindles",
                "Stage 3 (N3) Deep/Slow-Wave Sleep",
                "REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stage 3 (Deep Sleep) is when the glymphatic system is most active. For adrenal clients, maximizing this stage is critical for cognitive recovery and HPA axis regulation."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A client complains of 'wired but tired' energy at night and waking up consistently at 3:00 AM with a racing heart. What is the most likely physiological trigger?",
            "options": [
                "A surge in melatonin production",
                "A drop in blood glucose triggering a compensatory cortisol and adrenaline spike",
                "Excessive GABA activity in the hypothalamus",
                "A normal circadian dip in core body temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In adrenal dysfunction, poor glucose regulation often leads to nocturnal hypoglycemia. The body compensates by releasing cortisol and adrenaline to mobilize glucose, which wakes the client in a 'fight-or-flight' state."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Digital Sunset' protocol discussed in Lesson 3, what is the ideal ambient room temperature range for facilitating the transition to sleep?",
            "options": [
                "60–64°F (15–17°C)",
                "65–68°F (18–20°C)",
                "70–72°F (21–22°C)",
                "74–76°F (23–24°C)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A room temperature of 65–68°F (18–20°C) is clinically recommended to support the natural drop in core body temperature required for deep sleep and melatonin release."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Which amino acid, when taken before bed, has been shown to improve sleep quality by acting as an inhibitory neurotransmitter and slightly lowering core body temperature?",
            "options": [
                "L-Tyrosine",
                "Glycine",
                "L-Arginine",
                "Glutamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "3 grams of Glycine before bed has been shown in clinical trials to improve sleep efficacy and reduce daytime sleepiness without the 'hangover' effect of sedative drugs."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "A client who works as a graphic designer and spends 10 hours a day in front of high-resolution monitors reports feeling 'drained' despite sleeping 8 hours. Which of the Seven Types of Rest do they likely need most?",
            "options": [
                "Mental Rest",
                "Creative Rest",
                "Sensory Rest",
                "Social Rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory Rest is required when the nervous system is overstimulated by lights, screens, and background noise. This client is suffering from sensory overload common in the digital age."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which blue light (450–490 nm) disrupts the HPA axis and sleep-wake cycle?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the release of ghrelin",
                "It suppresses the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) from signaling melatonin production",
                "It increases the core body temperature by 2 degrees",
                "It slows down the heart rate too rapidly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light hits the melanopsin receptors in the eyes, which signals the SCN in the hypothalamus to inhibit melatonin, effectively 'tricking' the brain into thinking it is daytime."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "When monitoring recovery via Biometrics (Lesson 7), a high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) score generally indicates:",
            "options": [
                "A state of sympathetic dominance and high stress",
                "A healthy balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems",
                "Impeding cardiovascular failure",
                "That the client is overtraining and needs immediate rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV (more variance between beats) indicates a resilient autonomic nervous system with strong parasympathetic (vagal) tone, meaning the client is well-recovered."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "A 'Type A' client feels guilty when resting, viewing it as a waste of time. Which coaching strategy is most effective for overcoming this 'Rest Resistance'?",
            "options": [
                "Telling them they will get sick if they don't stop",
                "Reframing rest as 'Active Recovery' and a necessary 'Performance Multiplier'",
                "Suggesting they work harder now so they can rest later",
                "Ignoring the resistance and focusing only on supplement protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing rest as a tool for better performance appeals to the high-achiever's values, making rest feel like a productive part of their 'training' or 'career' rather than an absence of work."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Which evening nutritional strategy is specifically designed to prevent the 'Cortisol Spike' that causes middle-of-the-night waking?",
            "options": [
                "Intermittent fasting for 16 hours starting at 4 PM",
                "A high-sugar snack right before bed to spike insulin",
                "A small snack containing a complex carbohydrate, a healthy fat, and a protein",
                "Consuming a large glass of water only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A balanced snack (e.g., almond butter on a small piece of apple) provides a steady supply of glucose and slow-burning fuel to prevent the blood sugar dips that trigger nocturnal cortisol release."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "How does alcohol consumption in the evening affect the architecture of sleep in an adrenal-fatigued client?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the amount of REM sleep in the first half of the night",
                "It acts as a permanent sedative that improves deep sleep quality",
                "It suppresses REM sleep and causes 'rebound' wakefulness as the liver metabolizes the ethanol",
                "It has no measurable effect on the HPA axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alcohol may help with sleep onset but severely fragments sleep architecture, suppressing REM and causing a sympathetic 'rebound' that leads to poor recovery and morning fatigue."
