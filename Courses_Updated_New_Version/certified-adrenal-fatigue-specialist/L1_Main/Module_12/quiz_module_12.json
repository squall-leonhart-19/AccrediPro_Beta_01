            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1 regarding Advanced Stressor Identification, which 'stealth stressor' is most likely to cause a persistent, non-responsive elevation in evening cortisol despite standard lifestyle interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Occupational psychological stress",
                "Subclinical gut dysbiosis or H. pylori infection",
                "Occasional caffeine consumption before noon",
                "Lack of social engagement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stealth stressors like H. pylori or gut dysbiosis create internal physiological stress that the HPA axis must respond to 24/7, often leading to elevated evening cortisol that doesn't respond to typical 'calming' techniques."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Circadian Entrainment, what is the primary physiological mechanism by which morning sunlight exposure (specifically blue-green spectrum) anchors the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone",
                "Activation of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells which signal the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)",
                "Direct stimulation of the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone",
                "Activation of the dorsal vagal complex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are specifically sensitive to short-wavelength light and provide the primary input to the SCN, which serves as the body's master clock for cortisol rhythm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "In the context of Biochemical Individuality (Lesson 3), a 'Fast Oxidizer' (Parasympathetic dominant) client struggling with adrenal fatigue typically requires which macronutrient adjustment to stabilize blood sugar and HPA activity?",
            "options": [
                "A high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet to provide quick glucose",
                "A vegan diet with 80% complex carbohydrates",
                "A higher ratio of proteins and fats with lower glycemic carbohydrates",
                "A zero-carb ketogenic approach with intermittent fasting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fast oxidizers burn through glucose rapidly; providing higher ratios of proteins and fats helps slow down oxidative rates and prevents the reactive hypoglycemia that triggers adrenal stress."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses Neuro-Somatic Techniques. What does a high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reading generally indicate regarding a client's autonomic nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Dominance of the sympathetic 'fight or flight' response",
                "Strong parasympathetic 'vagal tone' and high adaptive resilience",
                "A state of 'Adrenal Exhaustion' where the heart is too tired to beat regularly",
                "Chronic inflammation and elevated systemic cytokines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates a healthy, flexible autonomic nervous system with strong parasympathetic (vagal) influence, allowing the body to recover quickly from stressors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Regarding Sleep Architecture (Lesson 5), why is the 'Glymphatic System' clearance particularly critical for clients in Stage 3 Adrenal Fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "It is the primary system for manufacturing cortisol during the night",
                "It clears metabolic waste and neurotoxic proteins from the brain during deep NREM sleep",
                "It regulates the conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver",
                "It manages the distribution of electrolytes to the adrenal medulla"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is most active during deep sleep; for adrenal clients, efficient waste clearance is essential to reduce the neuro-inflammatory load that keeps the HPA axis in a state of high alert."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 (Exercise Programming), what is the recommended 'Zone' for cardiovascular activity for a client in the early stages of adrenal recovery to prevent 'The Wall' (cortisol crash)?",
            "options": [
                "Zone 4: High-intensity anaerobic intervals",
                "Zone 5: Maximum effort sprints",
                "Zone 2: Low-intensity aerobic activity where they can maintain a conversation",
                "No cardiovascular activity is permitted under any circumstances"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zone 2 training builds mitochondrial density and aerobic capacity without placing an excessive 'stress load' on the HPA axis, unlike high-intensity training which triggers significant cortisol release."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "The '70% Rule' mentioned in Lesson 7 (Sustaining Vitality) suggests that a recovering client should:",
            "options": [
                "Only eat until they are 70% full",
                "Spend 70% of their day in complete silence",
                "Only exert 70% of the energy they 'feel' they have available on any given day",
                "Ensure 70% of their calories come from healthy fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 70% rule is a pacing strategy to prevent 'push-crash' cycles; by always leaving 30% in the 'tank,' the client avoids triggering an emergency adrenal response to meet daily demands."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the RESTORE Case Management Blueprint (Lesson 8), which step must occur BEFORE 'Rebuilding' through exercise?",
            "options": [
                "Empowering the client with long-term maintenance tools",
                "Taming the nervous system and Optimizing sleep architecture",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to provide energy for the workouts",
                "Testing for genetic polymorphisms (SNPs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to the RESTORE blueprint, one must 'Tame' the nervous system and 'Optimize' sleep/regeneration before 'Rebuilding' the body with exercise to ensure the client has the underlying foundation to handle the stress of movement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms at 10:00 PM. Based on Lesson 5, what environmental adjustment is most likely to facilitate the natural drop in core body temperature needed for sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing room temperature to 75°F (24°C) to relax muscles",
                "Lowering room temperature to 65-68°F (18-20°C) and using a warm foot bath",
                "Using a bright white light lamp for 15 minutes before bed",
                "Engaging in 20 minutes of vigorous calisthenics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A cool room temperature (65-68°F) combined with a warm bath (which causes vasodilation and subsequent core cooling) mimics the natural circadian drop in temperature required to trigger melatonin release."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the 'Glycemic Window' strategy for preventing exercise-induced adrenal flares in sensitive clients?",
            "options": [
                "Fasted exercise to maximize fat burning",
                "Consuming a small amount of complex carbohydrates and protein 30-60 minutes prior to movement",
                "Consuming only pure glucose during the workout",
                "Avoiding all food for 4 hours after exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consuming a balanced snack before exercise prevents the blood sugar drops that force the adrenals to secrete cortisol and adrenaline for gluconeogenesis during the workout."
