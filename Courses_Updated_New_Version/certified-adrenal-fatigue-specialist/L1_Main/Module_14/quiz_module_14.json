            "question": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™, what is the primary objective of the 'Establish' phase (L3) following the initial 'Recognize' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Implementing high-intensity interval training to boost metabolism",
                "Anchoring circadian biology and the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Establish' phase focuses on circadian biology as the foundation of HPA axis health, primarily by regulating light exposure and meal timing to normalize the cortisol rhythm."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the Bio-Psycho-Social Stressor model in L2, which of the following would be classified as a 'Biological' stressor that directly impacts the adrenal load?",
            "options": [
                "Occupational dissatisfaction and lack of autonomy",
                "Subclinical gut dysbiosis and chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leakage",
                "Perceived lack of social support from family members",
                "Financial instability and debt-related anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological stressors include internal physiological shifts such as gut dysbiosis, latent infections, or nutrient deficiencies, whereas the others fall under psychological or social categories."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "L3 discusses the 'Cortisol Awakening Response' (CAR). What is considered a healthy, physiological increase in cortisol levels within the first 30-45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease of 10-15% from waking levels",
                "A negligible increase of less than 5%",
                "An increase of 50% to 160% over the waking value",
                "A steady plateau that lasts until noon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A robust CAR (50-160% increase) is a marker of HPA axis plasticity and resilience. A blunted CAR is often associated with chronic burnout or PTSD."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In L4 (Nutritional Biochemistry), which nutrient is highlighted as having the highest concentration in the adrenal glands and is essential for the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone?",

                "Vitamin K2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The adrenal glands maintain one of the highest concentrations of Vitamin C in the body, which is rapidly consumed during the synthesis of steroid hormones."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "L5 introduces the 'Tame' phase. Which somatic tool is most effective for stimulating the auricular branch of the Vagus Nerve to shift a client out of a sympathetic 'High-Beta' state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Humming and tragus massage stimulate the vagus nerve (parasympathetic), helping to lower the heart rate and move the client into a 'Rest and Digest' state."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "L6 discusses Sleep Architecture. During which specific stage of sleep does the glymphatic system become up to 10 times more active in clearing metabolic waste from the brain?",
            "options": [
                "Stage 1 (Light Sleep)",
                "REM (Rapid Eye Movement)",

                "Waking transition state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow Wave Sleep (Stage 3) is the primary window for the glymphatic system to clear toxins, making it essential for cognitive recovery in adrenal fatigue clients."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In L7 (Rebuild), the concept of 'Hormetic Stress' is introduced. What is the prerequisite for a client to safely engage in hormetic stressors like cold plunges or sauna?",
            "options": [
                "They must be in the 'Alarm' phase of stress",
                "They must demonstrate sufficient adaptive capacity and a stabilized baseline",
                "They must have a total cortisol output of zero",
                "Hormetic stress should only be used when a client is at their most exhausted"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormetic stress requires the client to have enough 'reserve' or adaptive capacity. If applied during the 'Exhaustion' phase without stabilization, it can lead to further HPA crashing."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "L8 focuses on 'Empowerment' and behavioral change. If a client is in the 'Preparation' stage of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), what is the coach's primary role?",
            "options": [
                "To convince them that they have a problem",
                "To assist in developing a concrete action plan and setting a start date",
                "To provide long-term maintenance strategies to prevent relapse",
                "To ignore the behavior until the client reaches 'Action'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Preparation stage, the client is ready to change soon. The coach helps by refining the strategy and preparing for the 'Action' phase."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Wired but Tired' symptoms: low morning cortisol but a significant spike at 10:00 PM. Based on L4, which nutritional strategy is most appropriate?",

                "Total fasting from 4:00 PM onwards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phosphatidylserine helps blunt the evening cortisol spike, and complex carbs can support serotonin/melatonin production to improve sleep onset."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "L1 emphasizes that the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™ is a 'bottom-up' approach. What does this mean in a clinical context?",
            "options": [
                "Starting with high-level hormone replacement therapy first",
                "Focusing on the brain (top) before the body (bottom)",
                "Prioritizing foundational physiological safety and cellular health before complex interventions",
                "Treating only the symptoms that appear at the bottom of the feet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up refers to addressing the physiological foundations (circadian rhythms, nutrition, safety) to allow the higher-level systems (HPA axis regulation) to self-correct."
