            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "Beyond HPA axis stabilization, what is the primary cellular target for moving from 'recovery' to 'optimal vitality' as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid hormone receptor sensitivity",
                "Mitochondrial biogenesis and redox signaling",
                "Pancreatic insulin secretion",
                "Hepatic detoxification of phase II pathways"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True vitality mastery requires optimizing the mitochondria's ability to produce ATP and manage oxidative stress, moving beyond just 'balancing' cortisol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Hormetic Threshold' concept in Lesson 2, when is it appropriate to introduce high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or cold thermogenesis into a client's plan?",
            "options": [
                "During the acute 'Crash' phase to jumpstart the adrenals",
                "Only after the client has achieved a 'Vitality Reserve' and stable HPA rhythm",
                "Immediately upon starting the protocol to increase metabolic rate",
                "Once the client reaches Stage 3 exhaustion to stimulate the HPA axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormetic stressors (good stress) can backfire if the client does not have sufficient 'Vitality Reserve.' They must be introduced only after HPA stability is achieved."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3 regarding 'Environmental Mastery,' which specific light wavelength (measured in nanometers) is most disruptive to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and melatonin production at night?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 450-480nm range (blue light) is the most potent inhibitor of melatonin, signaling the SCN to suppress sleep hormones and maintain cortisol production."

        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "The 'Survivor to Thriver' mindset shift in Lesson 4 emphasizes moving away from 'Hyper-Vigilant Symptom Tracking.' What is the primary psychological risk of excessive tracking in late-stage recovery?",
            "options": [
                "It improves client compliance through data",
                "It reinforces the 'Sick Identity' and maintains a state of sympathetic dominance",
                "It reduces the placebo effect",
                "It prevents the client from noticing small improvements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Constant scanning for symptoms keeps the brain in a state of perceived threat (sympathetic dominance), which can stall the final stages of recovery."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the 'Tend-and-Befriend' response. Which hormone acts as a biological buffer against cortisol's damaging effects on the hippocampus during social connection?",

                "Pregnenolone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, released during positive social interaction and connection, directly modulates the HPA axis and protects brain structures from chronic cortisol exposure."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "When assessing Biological Age vs. Chronological Age (Lesson 6), which functional metric is considered the 'Gold Standard' for measuring the resilience of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)?",

                "Eat 80% protein and 20% carbohydrates",
                "Focus 80% on supplements and 20% on lifestyle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule prevents the 'orthorexia of recovery,' allowing clients to reintegrate into normal life without the stress of 100% perfection, which is unsustainable."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These are 'Red Flag' symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's), which is outside the scope of a Specialist and requires immediate medical intervention."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Lesson 6 highlights research showing that chronic HPA axis dysregulation and elevated oxidative stress can shorten telomeres. A 2022 meta-analysis suggests this can equate to how many years of 'accelerated' biological aging?",
            "options": [
                "1-2 years",
                "Over 20 years",
