            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Within the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Assessment Framework, what does the 'E' specifically represent in the context of the clinical intake?",
            "options": ["Endocrine Function", "Environmental Triggers", "Exercise Intensity", "Emotional Resilience"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework, 'E' stands for Environmental Triggers, which includes assessing exposure to mold, heavy metals, and blue light that may disrupt the HPA axis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A practitioner is deciding between saliva testing and the DUTCH (Dried Urine) test. Which biomarker is unique to the DUTCH test and provides a more accurate picture of total daily cortisol production?",
            "options": ["Free Cortisol", "Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)", "Metabolized Cortisol (THF/THE)", "DHEA-S"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolized cortisol (the sum of THF and THE) represents roughly 80% of cortisol production, whereas saliva only measures the 'free' fraction (1-3%), making DUTCH superior for assessing total glandular output."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a very low RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) on their morning HRV reading. According to Lesson 3, what is the most likely physiological state?",
            "options": ["High Vagal Tone", "Sympathetic Dominance and poor recovery", "Optimal Parasympathetic activation", "High metabolic flexibility"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the primary metric for parasympathetic (vagal) activity; a low score indicates the body is stuck in a sympathetic-dominant state with insufficient recovery resources."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In the Metabolic Assessment (L4), why is 'Reactive Hypoglycemia' considered a major driver of adrenal dysfunction?",
            "options": ["It causes permanent damage to the pancreas", "It forces the adrenals to secrete cortisol and adrenaline to mobilize glucose", "It lowers insulin sensitivity in the brain", "It prevents the absorption of Vitamin C"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops rapidly, the body perceives an emergency and triggers a 'survival' response, requiring the adrenals to produce cortisol and catecholamines to prevent neuroglycopenia."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which circadian biomarker is defined as the 'Gold Standard' for assessing the timing of the central biological clock in Lesson 5?",
            "options": ["Morning Cortisol peak", "Body temperature nadir", "Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO)", "Deep sleep percentage"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DLMO is the most reliable biochemical marker for determining the phase of the circadian rhythm and identifying Phase Delay or Phase Advance syndromes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "An Organic Acid Test (OAT) shows significantly elevated levels of Xanthurenate. According to Lesson 6, this is a functional indicator of a deficiency in which nutrient?",
            "options": ["Vitamin B12", "Magnesium", "Vitamin B6", "Zinc"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Xanthurenate is a metabolic byproduct of tryptophan; its elevation specifically indicates a functional need for Vitamin B6 (P5P), which is critical for neurotransmitter synthesis in stressed clients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "The 'Allostatic Load Index' (Lesson 7) typically aggregates biomarkers from which three primary systems to determine cumulative 'wear and tear'?",
            "options": ["Cardiovascular, Metabolic, and Neuroendocrine", "Digestive, Skeletal, and Muscular", "Integumentary, Renal, and Hepatic", "Respiratory, Lymphatic, and Immune"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load is assessed by looking at the intersection of cardiovascular (BP/HRV), metabolic (HbA1c/Lipids), and neuroendocrine (Cortisol/DHEA) markers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "When performing longitudinal tracking (L8), what is the 'Optimization Window'—the recommended timeframe to wait before re-testing a full DUTCH panel after implementing a new protocol?",
            "options": ["2-4 weeks", "4-6 weeks", "12-16 weeks", "6-12 months"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 recommends 12-16 weeks (3-4 months) for re-testing hormones to allow for cellular turnover and for the HPA axis feedback loops to stabilize under the new intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client shows a 'Flat' diurnal cortisol curve on saliva testing but reports high energy and has a high HRV. Based on Lesson 7's discussion on Physical Resilience, how might this be interpreted?",
            "options": ["The client is in Stage 3 exhaustion", "High resilience/fitness is buffering the HPA dysfunction (Allostatic state)", "The test results are definitely a lab error", "The client has high levels of systemic inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physically resilient or highly fit individuals can sometimes maintain high function and high HRV (allostatic state) even when their HPA axis shows signs of 'flatness' or dysregulation."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Which 'R.E.S.T.O.R.E.' category focuses on the assessment of the client's internal biological clock and light hygiene?",
            "options": ["R - Rhythm", "S - Stressors", "T - Toxins", "E - Environmental"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in R.E.S.T.O.R.E. stands for Rhythm, specifically assessing circadian alignment, sleep-wake cycles, and meal timing consistency."
