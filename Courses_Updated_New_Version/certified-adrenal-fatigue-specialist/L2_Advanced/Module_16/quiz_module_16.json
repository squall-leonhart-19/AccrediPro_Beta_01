            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the 'Wired but Tired' high-performer phenotype described in Lesson 1, which diurnal cortisol pattern is most commonly observed during the 'Resistance' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Low morning cortisol with a sharp spike at 10 PM",
                "High morning cortisol that remains elevated throughout the day",
                "Flat-lined cortisol with no discernible rhythm",
                "Extremely high morning cortisol followed by a total crash at noon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High performers often exhibit a 'flipped' curve where morning cortisol is low (difficulty waking) and evening cortisol spikes due to late-night work or stimulant use, leading to sleep onset issues."

        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Metabolic Entanglement, how does chronic hypercortisolemia directly contribute to insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "By suppressing the production of glucagon in the pancreas",
                "By stimulating gluconeogenesis and inhibiting glucose uptake in peripheral tissues",
                "By increasing the sensitivity of insulin receptors in skeletal muscle",
                "By promoting the rapid clearance of glucose from the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a glucocorticoid that raises blood sugar by stimulating the liver to produce glucose (gluconeogenesis) while simultaneously making peripheral tissues less sensitive to insulin to ensure the brain has adequate fuel during 'threats'."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the context of the perimenopausal transition (Lesson 3), why does adrenal health become the 'linchpin' for symptom management?",
            "options": [
                "The ovaries begin producing more cortisol to compensate for lost estrogen",
                "The adrenal glands must take over the primary production of sex hormone precursors like DHEA and androstenedione",
                "Progesterone levels increase during perimenopause, placing a burden on the adrenals",
                "The pituitary gland stops communicating with the adrenals once menstruation ceases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As ovarian function declines, the adrenal glands become the primary source of sex hormone precursors. If the adrenals are overtaxed by stress, they cannot effectively manage this 'adrenal switch,' leading to more severe menopausal symptoms."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses Post-Viral Fatigue. Which biomarker is frequently elevated in clients with chronic immune activation and HPA axis dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)",
                "Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNF-alpha)",
                "Alkaline phosphatase",
                "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic immune activation following a virus often results in a 'cytokine storm' or persistent low-grade inflammation (IL-6, TNF-alpha), which keeps the HPA axis in a state of constant, exhausting stimulation."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A professional athlete presents with a 20% drop in baseline Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and persistent fatigue. Based on Lesson 5, what is the most likely physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "Parasympathetic dominance and over-recovery",
                "Sympathetic dominance and Athlete Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)",
                "Normal adaptive response to high-intensity interval training",
                "Acute phase of the General Adaptation Syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A significant and persistent drop in HRV is a clinical marker for sympathetic dominance and a lack of adaptive capacity, signaling the onset of Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 introduces the 'Window of Tolerance' in trauma-informed recovery. What occurs when a client moves into 'Hyper-arousal'?",
            "options": [
                "The body enters a 'freeze' state characterized by low heart rate and dissociation",
                "The client becomes emotionally numb and physically exhausted",
                "The sympathetic nervous system activates, leading to fight-or-flight responses and emotional flooding",
                "The HPA axis enters a state of 'hypocortisolism' to protect the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal is the upper boundary of the Window of Tolerance where the sympathetic nervous system takes over, resulting in anxiety, racing thoughts, and a heightened fight-or-flight response."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, which environmental factor in the modern workspace is cited as a primary disruptor of the circadian cortisol peak?",
            "options": [
                "Ergonomic chair misalignment",
                "Exposure to high-intensity blue light (450-480nm) after sunset",

                "Ambient office temperatures above 72 degrees Fahrenheit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light exposure in the evening suppresses melatonin and can cause a phase shift in the circadian rhythm, leading to elevated evening cortisol and suppressed morning cortisol."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the recommended '80/20' rule for long-term maintenance and relapse prevention?",
            "options": [
                "80% of the diet should be protein, 20% should be carbohydrates",
                "80% of the time should be spent working, 20% resting",
                "The client can tolerate 'stressor deviations' 20% of the time if their foundation is solid 80% of the time",
                "80% of supplements should be discontinued after the first 6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule for maintenance suggests that once the HPA axis is resilient, the client can handle occasional stressors or dietary indiscretions (20%) without triggering a full relapse, provided their core habits remain stable (80%)."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old female executive presents with weight gain around the midsection, brain fog, and irregular cycles. Her fasting insulin is 18 μIU/mL and her DHEA-S is low. What is the priority intervention based on Module 16 concepts?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) to burn visceral fat",
                "Strict ketogenic dieting to lower insulin immediately",
                "Cortisol-conscious movement and blood sugar stabilization to reduce the HPA-Metabolic load",
                "Aggressive thyroid hormone replacement therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the 'metabolic entanglement' and perimenopausal markers, the priority is to stabilize the HPA axis and blood sugar simultaneously. High-intensity exercise or extreme dieting would likely further stress the adrenals and worsen insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "Which somatic tool mentioned in Lesson 6 is specifically designed to help a client 're-negotiate' the nervous system's response to a perceived threat without re-traumatization?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)",
                "Somatic Tracking and Titration",
                "Heavy weightlifting to 'burn off' adrenaline",
                "Prolonged fasting to reset the HPA axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves experiencing small, manageable amounts of stored survival energy or sensation to gradually discharge it from the nervous system without overwhelming the client's window of tolerance."
