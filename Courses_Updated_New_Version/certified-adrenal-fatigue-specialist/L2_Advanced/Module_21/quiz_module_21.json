            "question": "In the RESTORE Method™ framework, which phase must be prioritized immediately after 'Recognizing' stressors but before 'Supporting' with targeted micronutrients?",
            "options": [
                "Optimize (Sleep Architecture)",
                "Establish (Circadian & Glycemic Foundations)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Establish' phase focuses on the fundamental 'biological clock' and blood sugar stability, which provides the metabolic safety necessary for deeper interventions."

            "question": "According to the Clinical Frameworks lesson (L1), which 'Red Flag' symptom requires immediate medical triage rather than proceeding with an adrenal fatigue protocol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unexplained rapid weight loss is a clinical red flag that may indicate underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy or Addison's disease) and requires medical clearance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal stressors are physiological burdens within the body, such as infections, gut dysbiosis, or oxidative stress, whereas the others are external environmental or psychosocial stressors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hypoglycemia is perceived as a survival threat, forcing the HPA axis to trigger a 'stress response' to maintain blood glucose levels, leading to chronic adrenal strain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blue-light blocking and down-regulation help lower evening cortisol and support natural melatonin production, addressing the 'wired' state."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In the 'Rebuild' phase (L6), what is the primary goal of introducing 'Hormetic Stress'?",
            "options": [
                "To push the client to their absolute physical limit",
                "To induce a temporary state of exhaustion",
                "To widen the 'Window of Tolerance' and improve adaptive resilience",
                "To prove the client is fully healed from adrenal fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormetic stress (like progressive exercise) is used in the Rebuild phase to carefully challenge and expand the body's ability to handle stress without crashing."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "Using Objective Monitoring (L7), a practitioner notices a client's 7-day Heart Rate Variability (HRV) trend is steadily declining despite 'resting.' This most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The client is getting stronger and more fit.",
                "Accumulating non-physical stress or a brewing subclinical infection.",
                "The 'Support' phase supplements are working perfectly.",
                "The client needs to increase their exercise intensity immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A declining HRV trend during rest suggests the total allostatic load is exceeding the body's recovery capacity, often due to hidden stressors or illness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stage 3 clients have very little 'reserve.' The priority is to stop the 'leak' of energy by regulating the nervous system and establishing basic rhythms."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of 'Empower' is self-efficacy—the client's ability to maintain their own health using the tools and biofeedback awareness they learned during the program."
