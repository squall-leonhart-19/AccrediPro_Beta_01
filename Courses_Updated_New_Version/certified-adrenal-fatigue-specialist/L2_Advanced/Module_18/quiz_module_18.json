            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "The 'Unified Theory of Adrenal Recovery' presented in Lesson 1 argues that HPA axis dysfunction is a systemic adaptation. Which three physiological pillars form the 'Recovery Triad' that must be addressed simultaneously?",
            "options": [
                "Neuroendocrine, Metabolic, and Immune systems",
                "Cardiovascular, Respiratory, and Renal systems",
                "Musculoskeletal, Integumentary, and Digestive systems",
                "Cognitive, Behavioral, and Spiritual systems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Unified Theory emphasizes that the HPA axis does not fail in a vacuum; recovery requires addressing the cross-talk between the neuroendocrine (hormones), metabolic (energy), and immune (inflammation) systems."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "In the RESTORE Roadmap assessment framework, what is the primary objective of the 'Stabilization' phase before moving into 'Optimization'?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive detoxification and heavy metal chelation",
                "High-intensity interval training to boost mitochondrial density",
                "Nervous system down-regulation and glycemic variability reduction",
                "Rapid tapering of all glandular supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the RESTORE Roadmap, stabilization focuses on creating safety in the body by calming the sympathetic nervous system and ensuring stable blood sugar, which provides the foundation for deeper healing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the 'Golden Rule' of Phase-Specific Integration when dealing with a client in a 'Crisis' (Stage 3) adrenal state?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulate the HPA axis with high-dose caffeine and adaptogens",
                "Prioritize anabolic recovery and caloric sufficiency over metabolic flexibility",
                "Implement a strict ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation",
                "Focus exclusively on psychological trauma before physical intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Crisis phase, the body is in a catabolic state. The priority is anabolic support (building back up) and ensuring the body has enough fuel (calories/electrolytes) to stop the 'emergency' stress response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "A practitioner encounters a 'Plateau' in a client who has made 60% progress but has remained stagnant for 4 weeks. According to Lesson 4, what is the first 'Clinical Troubleshooting' step?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the dosage of all current supplements by 50%",
                "Screen for 'Hidden Stressors' such as occult dental infections or mold exposure",
                "Discharge the client as 'non-compliant'",
                "Switch to a completely different dietary philosophy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When progress stalls despite correct implementation, it often indicates an unaddressed 'internal' stressor, such as a low-grade infection, toxin load, or environmental trigger that is keeping the HPA axis 'wired'."

        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Metabolic-Adrenal Cross-Talk.' How does chronic cortisol elevation specifically interfere with thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to active T3",
                "It has no effect on thyroid physiology",
                "It inhibits TSH production and increases the conversion of T4 to Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "It decreases the sensitivity of the thyroid gland to iodine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress/high cortisol signals the body to slow down metabolism, leading to suppressed TSH and a shunting of T4 into the inactive rT3 form to conserve energy."

        {
            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "In 'Behavioral Architecture' (Lesson 6), what is the 'Anchor Habit' technique used for?",
            "options": [
                "Forcing a client to wake up at 4:00 AM regardless of fatigue",
                "Tying a new recovery behavior to an existing, automatic daily routine",
                "Using heavy weights to ground the nervous system",
                "A form of hypnosis used to change dietary preferences"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchor habits (or habit stacking) increase compliance by attaching a new, difficult behavior (like taking supplements or doing breathwork) to an established habit (like brushing teeth)."

        {
            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "In the Case Study Masterclass, 'Sarah' presented with 'Wired but Tired' symptoms and paradoxical reactions to Ashwagandha. What did this reaction suggest about her clinical profile?",
            "options": [
                "She was not taking a high enough dose",
                "She had an underlying Th1-dominant immune imbalance and CYP450 congestion",
                "She was simply imagining the symptoms",
                "She needed more cardiovascular exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical reactions to adaptogens often indicate that the body's detoxification pathways (CYP450) are overwhelmed or that the herb is shifting an already imbalanced immune system in the wrong direction."

        {
            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the most effective way for a practitioner to sustain 'Clinical Excellence' and avoid burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Working 80 hours a week to see as many clients as possible",
                "Never taking vacations to ensure client continuity",
                "Practicing 'Radical Self-Regulation' and maintaining strict clinical boundaries",
                "Avoiding all complex cases to keep stress levels low"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The practitioner must model the health they teach. Radical self-regulation and boundaries prevent 'empathetic distress' and ensure the practitioner remains a 'clear mirror' for the client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that what percentage of 'treatment-resistant' adrenal fatigue cases involve undiagnosed gut dysbiosis or intestinal permeability?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Approximately 35%",
                "Approximately 70%",
                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that roughly 70% of stubborn cases have a 'gut-adrenal' component, where LPS translocation (leaky gut) keeps the HPA axis in a state of constant activation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "What is the primary indicator that a client is ready to move from the 'Transition' phase to the 'Resiliency' phase of the RESTORE Roadmap?",
            "options": [
                "They have gone one day without feeling tired",
                "Stable diurnal rhythm, improved exercise recovery, and consistent Basal Body Temperature",
                "They have reached their goal weight",
                "They no longer require any vitamins or minerals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resiliency is marked by the body's ability to handle stressors without crashing. Stable temperatures and the absence of post-exertional malaise are key physiological markers of systemic 'buffer' returning."
