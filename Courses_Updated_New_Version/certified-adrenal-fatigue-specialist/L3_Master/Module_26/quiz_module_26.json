            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Recovery' (L1), why is Phase 3 (Somatic Regulation) positioned strictly before Phase 5 (Hormetic Stress)?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client has established a high-protein diet first",
                "To build the 'vagal brake' and nervous system capacity required to handle the physiological 'insult' of hormetic stressors",
                "Because somatic regulation is the only phase that addresses cortisol production directly",
                "To allow the liver's peripheral clocks to reset before adding physical movement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic regulation builds the necessary capacity (resilience) so that later hormetic stressors, like exercise or temperature therapy, stimulate growth rather than causing further HPA axis depletion."

        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "During Phase 1 (Advanced Stress Mapping), which tool is used to identify the 20% of stressors responsible for 80% of the HPA axis drain?",
            "options": [
                "The Cortisol-DHEA Ratio Matrix",
                "The Circadian Anchor Log",
                "The Pareto Stress Assessment",
                "The Somatic Load Inventory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Pareto Stress Assessment is a strategic tool in Phase 1 designed to prioritize the removal of high-impact triggers that provide the most significant 'recovery ROI' for the client."

        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Chrono-Nutrition' principles in Phase 2, what is the primary 'Circadian Anchor' for resetting the peripheral clock in the liver?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming 30-40g of protein within 60 minutes of waking",
                "Drinking 16oz of water with sea salt at 10:00 AM",
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates after 6:00 PM",
                "Taking a Vitamin B-Complex supplement at noon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A protein-rich breakfast within an hour of waking acts as a powerful metabolic anchor, signaling to the liver that the day has begun and stabilizing blood sugar to prevent mid-morning cortisol spikes."

        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "In Phase 3 (Somatic Regulation), which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric is the most sensitive indicator of improved Vagal Tone?",
            "options": [
                "Low-Frequency (LF) power",
                "The LF/HF ratio",
                "High-Frequency (HF) power",
                "Mean Heart Rate (MHR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-Frequency (HF) power in HRV analysis is primarily driven by the parasympathetic nervous system (vagus nerve), making it the gold standard for tracking somatic recovery progress."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "When 'Engineering Restorative Environments' (Phase 4), what is the 'Darkness Window' required to optimize the natural surge of melatonin?",
            "options": [
                "30 minutes of total darkness before sleep",
                "90 to 120 minutes of dim, amber/red-shifted light prior to bed",
                "15 minutes of blue light exposure followed by 15 minutes of darkness",
                "Continuous darkness from 8:00 PM onwards regardless of sleep time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Darkness Window' of 90-120 minutes of low-intensity, red-shifted light allows the pineal gland to transition into melatonin production without inhibition from blue-light frequencies."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "A client in Phase 5 (Functional Rebuilding) wants to begin High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). Which clinical indicator suggests they are NOT yet ready for this hormetic stress?",
            "options": [
                "A morning waking temperature consistently below 97.2°F (36.2°C)",
                "A craving for salt in the evening",
                "An HRV score that has increased by 10% over the last month",
                "Being able to sleep 7 hours without waking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A consistently low basal body temperature (below 97.2°F) indicates a suppressed metabolic rate and insufficient 'cellular fuel' to safely process high-intensity hormetic stress."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "The 'Vitality Maintenance Ratio' in Phase 6 suggests that to prevent relapse, a recovered client should spend what percentage of their weekly schedule in active 'Restorative Mode'?",

                "5%",
                "10%",

                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maintain HPA axis resilience and prevent relapse, 20-30% of the weekly schedule should remain dedicated to restorative practices (somatic work, deep rest, etc.) even when the client feels asymptomatic."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "During 'Clinical Troubleshooting' (L8), how can a practitioner distinguish a 'Healing Crisis' from a 'True Regression'?",
            "options": [
                "A healing crisis only involves digestive symptoms",
                "A healing crisis typically lasts 48-72 hours and is followed by a higher baseline of energy",
                "A regression is always accompanied by a fever",
                "There is no clinical difference; both require immediate program cessation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healing crisis (Herxheimer-like reaction or systemic shift) is transient (48-72 hours) and results in improved vitality afterward, whereas a regression shows a sustained decline in function."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah is in Phase 2 but reports a '3 PM crash.' She eats a protein-rich breakfast and lunch. Which troubleshooting step is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increase her caffeine intake at 2:00 PM",
                "Check for 'Circadian Leaks' such as lack of morning sunlight or excessive blue light exposure",
                "Transition her immediately to Phase 5 exercise",
                "Reduce her protein intake and increase fruit juice consumption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If nutrition is optimized, 'Circadian Leaks' (like lack of natural light to set the suprachiasmatic nucleus) are the most common cause of afternoon energy dips in adrenal recovery programs."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "Research on 'Deep Sleep Architecture' (Phase 4) shows that Glymphatic clearance (brain detoxification) is most efficient when bedroom temperature is kept between:",
            "options": [
                "72°F to 75°F (22°C to 24°C)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A cool environment (65-68°F) facilitates the drop in core body temperature required for deep NREM sleep, which is when the glymphatic system is most active in clearing metabolic waste."
