            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™, which phase specifically focuses on using somatic tools to shift the body from a sympathetic 'fight or flight' state to a parasympathetic 'rest and digest' state?",
            "options": [
                "Recognize Stressors",
                "Establish Rhythms",
                "Tame the Nervous System",
                "Optimize Rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'T' in the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Method™ stands for 'Tame the Nervous System,' which involves somatic tools and vagus nerve stimulation to facilitate the shift to parasympathetic dominance."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "When assessing a 4-point salivary cortisol map, a 'flat' curve with low levels across all four points (morning, noon, afternoon, night) most likely indicates which stage of HPA axis dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "Stage 1: Acute Alarm Reaction",
                "Stage 2: Resistance Phase",
                "Stage 3: Advanced Exhaustion",
                "Adaptive Hypercortisolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flat, low cortisol curve is the hallmark of Stage 3 (Exhaustion), where the HPA axis has down-regulated its response to chronic stress, leading to low output throughout the day."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Support Nutrition' (S) pillar, why is blood sugar stabilization considered the first priority for adrenal recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Because insulin is the only hormone that regulates cortisol",
                "Because hypoglycemia acts as a potent internal metabolic stressor that triggers cortisol release",
                "Because high-protein diets are the only way to repair the adrenal cortex",
                "Because glucose is the primary fuel source for the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is perceived by the brain as a survival threat, forcing the adrenals to pump out cortisol to mobilize glucose. Stabilizing blood sugar removes this constant 'emergency' trigger."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms, specifically high energy and anxiety at 10:00 PM. According to the 'Establish Rhythms' (E) phase, what is the most likely physiological disruption?",
            "options": [
                "A blunted Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)",
                "An inverted cortisol rhythm with an evening spike",
                "Excessive melatonin production in the afternoon",
                "A deficiency in aldosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'tired but wired' phenomenon is frequently caused by an inverted rhythm where cortisol levels rise in the evening instead of dropping, often due to blue light exposure or late-day stressors."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "In 'Module 6: Rebuild Resilience,' the concept of 'Hormesis' is applied. What is the correct application of this principle for a recovering adrenal client?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging high-intensity interval training (HIIT) immediately to force adaptation",
                "Avoiding all forms of stress indefinitely to prevent any cortisol release",
                "Introducing brief, controlled stressors (like gentle movement or temperature shifts) that the body can successfully adapt to",
                "Using high-dose caffeine to stimulate adrenal output during workouts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormesis involves using small, manageable amounts of stress to trigger a positive adaptation. In adrenal recovery, this must be done gradually to ensure the client has the 'adaptive reserve' to handle the stimulus."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is found in its highest concentration in the body within the adrenal glands and is rapidly depleted during the 'Recognize Stressors' (R) phase of chronic stress?",

                "Vitamin D3",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Zinc",
                "Vitamin B12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The adrenal glands have the highest concentration of Vitamin C in the human body. It is essential for the production of both cortisol and catecholamines and is used up quickly during prolonged stress."

        {
            "id": "final_7",
            "question": "During 'Module 22: Ethical Considerations,' what is the primary boundary for a Certified Adrenal Fatigue Specialist™ regarding medical diagnoses?",
            "options": [
                "Specialists can diagnose Addison's disease but not Cushing's syndrome",
                "Specialists may interpret labs to provide medical diagnoses if the client signs a waiver",
                "Specialists provide educational assessments and lifestyle protocols but do not diagnose or treat medical diseases",
                "Specialists can prescribe bioidentical hormones if they have a Level 3 certification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The scope of practice for a Specialist is strictly educational and supportive. They use assessments to guide lifestyle interventions, not to diagnose or treat medical conditions like Addison's or clinical depression."

            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "In 'Module 17: Complex Client Scenarios,' how should a practitioner handle a client who experiences a 'crash' after a seemingly successful week of increased activity?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client to 'push through' to build mental toughness",
                "Immediately increase the dosage of adrenal glandulars",
                "Identify if the client exceeded their 'energy envelope' and return to the 'Optimize Rest' (O) phase",
                "Discontinue the program as it is clearly not working"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'crash' usually indicates that the 'Rebuild Resilience' phase was introduced too quickly or the client exceeded their current adaptive capacity (energy envelope). Returning to 'Optimize Rest' allows the system to stabilize."

        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "What is the role of the Glymphatic System in the 'Optimize Rest' (O) phase of the RESTORE Method™?",
            "options": [
                "It regulates the production of DHEA in the adrenal cortex",
                "It is a waste-clearance system in the brain that primarily functions during deep sleep",
                "It is the primary pathway for the absorption of Magnesium",
                "It triggers the release of adrenaline during the REM cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system clears metabolic waste (including beta-amyloid) from the brain during deep sleep. For adrenal clients, optimizing this system is vital for clearing 'brain fog' and restoring cognitive function."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "When using the 'Treatment Planning' (M21) framework, which of the following is a 'red flag' that requires immediate referral to a medical doctor?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Morning sunlight sets the circadian clock and triggers the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), while blocking blue light at night allows melatonin to rise naturally, facilitating the cortisol drop required for sleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_12",
            "question": "The 'Empower Vitality' (E) phase of the methodology focuses on 'Long-Term Mastery.' What is a key indicator that a client has successfully reached this stage?",

                "They have stopped all forms of meditation and rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitality and resilience are characterized by the body's ability to respond to a stressor and return to homeostasis efficiently. This 'metabolic and hormonal flexibility' is the goal of the final stage."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_13",
            "question": "In 'Module 33: Legal & Compliance,' what is the most important document to have a client sign before beginning an adrenal coaching program?",
