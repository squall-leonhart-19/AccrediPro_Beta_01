            "question": "In Lesson 1 regarding environmental triggers, which 'hidden' factor is most likely to trigger a chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) that mimics or exacerbates Fibromyalgia symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Occupational noise pollution",
                "Water-damaged building exposure (Mycotoxins)",
                "Occasional consumption of processed sugars",
                "High-altitude living environments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mycotoxins from water-damaged buildings can trigger CIRS, which shares significant symptomatic overlap with Fibromyalgia, including profound fatigue and widespread pain."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR) theory discussed in Lesson 2, what happens to mitochondrial function during chronic illness?",
            "options": [
                "Mitochondria increase ATP production to fight the perceived threat",
                "Mitochondria shift from energy production to cellular defense, reducing available ATP",
                "Mitochondria undergo rapid mitophagy to clear out all healthy cells",
                "Mitochondria become dormant and stop responding to oxygen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cell Danger Response (CDR) is a metabolic state where mitochondria prioritize cellular defense over energy production, leading to the persistent fatigue seen in FM."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 describes 'Alpha-Delta Sleep Intrusion.' How does this phenomenon specifically impact a Fibromyalgia patient's physiology?",
            "options": [
                "It causes excessive REM sleep, leading to vivid nightmares",
                "It results in 'non-restorative sleep' where wakeful brain waves interrupt deep, healing sleep",
                "It increases the production of Growth Hormone during the day",
                "It prevents the brain from entering Stage 1 sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha-delta sleep intrusion occurs when alpha waves (associated with wakefulness) interrupt delta waves (deep sleep), preventing the body from performing critical tissue repair and neurochemical regulation."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "For a client presenting with both Fibromyalgia and Hypermobility (hEDS), which movement strategy is recommended in Lesson 4 to avoid 'flaring' the central nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive static stretching to release tight fascia",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypermobile clients often have poor proprioception; using isometrics and mid-range movements provides stability without overstretching tissues that are already lax."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological marker used to assess Vagus Nerve tone and the state of the Autonomic Nervous System, as discussed in Lesson 5?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV is the gold standard for measuring the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems; higher HRV generally indicates better vagal tone."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, the concept of 'Biographical Disruption' refers to which psychological challenge in Fibromyalgia?",

                "The disconnect between a person's pre-illness identity and their current life with chronic pain",
                "The inability to plan for future events more than 24 hours in advance",
                "A clinical diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biographical disruption occurs when a chronic illness shatters a person's sense of self and their expected life trajectory, requiring a 're-authoring' of their identity."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, how does 'Leaky Gut' (Increased Intestinal Permeability) contribute to Central Sensitization?",
            "options": [
                "By causing direct damage to the spinal cord",
                "By allowing Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the bloodstream, triggering microglial activation in the brain",

                "By increasing the speed of nerve conduction in the peripheral limbs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxins) crossing the gut barrier triggers a systemic inflammatory response that activates microglia in the CNS, lowering the pain threshold."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "In Coaching Mastery (Lesson 8), what is the most effective way to help a client who is stuck in a 'Boom-Bust' cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage them to push through the 'bust' phase to build mental toughness",
                "Implement 'Activity Pacing' based on time or heart rate rather than how they feel in the moment",
                "Advise them to stop all physical activity until they are pain-free for 30 days",
                "Tell them to only exercise on 'Boom' days when they have the most energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pacing based on objective measures (time/HR) prevents the over-exertion that leads to a crash, helping to stabilize energy levels over time."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client with low Vagus Nerve tone and high anxiety would benefit most from which specific breathing technique mentioned in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid 'Breath of Fire' to energize the system",
                "Chest breathing with short, shallow inhalations",

                "Holding the breath for as long as possible (breath retention)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longer exhalations stimulate the Vagus nerve and signal the brain to shift from a sympathetic (fight/flight) to a parasympathetic (rest/digest) state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 and Acetyl-L-Carnitine are essential cofactors in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and have shown efficacy in reducing fatigue and pain in FM clinical trials."
