            "question": "In the 'Yellow Light' system of flare prevention, what is the primary objective when a client identifies 'Tier 1' warning signs?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate cessation of all physical activity and bed rest",
                "Strategic activity reduction and sensory down-regulation to prevent a full flare",
                "Increasing exercise intensity to 'flush out' metabolic waste",
                "Maintaining the current schedule to build psychological resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Yellow Light' system identifies early warning signs (Tier 1) to trigger immediate, pre-planned adjustments in activity and sensory load, aiming to stabilize the nervous system before a full flare occurs."

                "Complete darkness for at least 6 hours during daylight hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Precision-tinted lenses like FL-41 and warm-spectrum lighting (around 2700K) reduce the specific wavelengths of light that often trigger migraine and sensory overload in fibromyalgia patients."

                "A successful transition to the RESTORE 'Vitality' stage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A downward trend in HRV (specifically RMSSD) indicates a lack of recovery and an overactive sympathetic nervous system, often serving as a leading indicator of an impending flare."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "In the 'Psychology of Self-Management,' what does the research say about the relationship between 'Self-Efficacy' and pain intensity?",
            "options": [
                "There is no correlation between self-efficacy and physical pain",
                "Higher self-efficacy is statistically correlated with lower perceived pain and higher functional status",
                "Higher self-efficacy actually increases pain because clients 'over-do' it",
                "Self-efficacy only affects mood, not physical symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High self-efficacy—the belief in one's ability to manage their condition—is one of the strongest predictors of lower pain interference and better functional outcomes in chronic pain patients."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "The 'Architecture of Enduring Management' emphasizes shifting from a 'Medical Model' to a 'Biopsychosocial Self-Management Model.' What is a key characteristic of this shift?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-management emphasizes the client's role in optimizing their own daily function, quality of life, and vitality rather than searching for a singular 'cure' for a chronic condition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Assertive Sandwich' allows clients to set firm boundaries (e.g., 'I can't attend the party') while maintaining social connection and reducing the emotional stress that can trigger flares."

            "options": [
                "Lead measures track the result; lag measures track the daily habits",
                "Lead measures are objective; lag measures are subjective",
                "Lead measures track the daily actions (e.g., sleep hours); lag measures track the end result (e.g., FIQ score)",
                "There is no difference; they are used interchangeably in the RESTORE framework"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lead measures are the daily, controllable behaviors that influence the outcome, while lag measures (like a monthly pain score) represent the result of those behaviors over time."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensory snacks are short, targeted interventions like cold-water immersion (vagus nerve stimulation) or weighted blankets that help reset a hyper-aroused nervous system."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "The 'Vitality Roadmap' integrates the RESTORE framework for life. What is the '80/20 Rule of Management' mentioned in Lesson 8?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule in this context suggests that identifying and managing the vital few triggers (the 20%) that cause the majority of flares (the 80%) yields the highest return on management effort."
