            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for the 'top-down' modulation of pain and is often found to have higher gray matter density in resilient fibromyalgia patients?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)",
                "The Amygdala",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is essential for executive function and top-down pain regulation; resilient individuals often show better connectivity between the PFC and the pain inhibitory systems."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rumination refers to the repetitive dwelling on pain-related thoughts, which is a core component of catastrophizing that amplifies the neurological perception of pain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion helps clients step back from their thoughts (e.g., 'I am a burden') and see them as transient mental events rather than objective facts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-goals aligned with values allow for small wins that respect the client's current energy envelope, preventing the overexertion that leads to crashes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Social resilience involves navigating the 'Invisible Illness Paradox' by communicating needs clearly and managing the social drain of explaining symptoms."

                "The overproduction of cortisol by the thyroid gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypocortisolism is the 'burnout' of the HPA axis where the body no longer produces sufficient cortisol to manage inflammation or stress effectively."

                "To ensure the coach gets paid during the flare-up",
                "To reduce decision fatigue and cognitive load when the client's 'brain fog' is high during a flare",

                "To provide a document for the client's employer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During a flare, cognitive function (brain fog) is impaired. Having a pre-written plan removes the need for complex decision-making when the client is at their lowest capacity."

                "Accepting that their life no longer has a purpose",
                "Identifying the underlying value (e.g., 'physical vitality') and finding a micro-activity that honors it (e.g., a 5-minute gentle walk)",
                "Focusing on the loss of the marathon until the grief passes",
                "Switching to a values-system that does not involve physical health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ACT teaches that while goals (marathons) may change due to illness, the underlying values (vitality) can still be expressed through different, accessible actions."
