            "question": "In the context of Central Sensitization (L1), what does the 'wind-up' phenomenon specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The psychological anticipation of a painful event.",
                "The temporal summation of second pain where repetitive noxious stimuli at a constant intensity lead to increased pain perception.",
                "The physical exhaustion felt after a period of high sympathetic activity.",
                "The process of muscle tightening prior to a restorative movement session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wind-up, or temporal summation, is a key feature of central sensitization where the CNS becomes increasingly reactive to repetitive stimuli, making the pain feel more intense even if the stimulus doesn't change."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Sympathetic Dominance (L2), what is a common HPA axis finding in long-term Fibromyalgia patients?",
            "options": [
                "Excessively high morning cortisol levels (Hypercortisolism).",
                "A blunted Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and low overall diurnal cortisol.",
                "Total absence of adrenaline production.",
                "Hyper-reactive insulin sensitivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While acute stress causes high cortisol, chronic Fibromyalgia often results in a 'burned out' HPA axis, characterized by a blunted morning response and low daily cortisol levels."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "When measuring Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a marker of Vagal Tone (L3), what does a 'high' HRV score generally indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The heart is beating too fast and the client is in tachycardia.",
                "The sympathetic nervous system is in total control.",
                "Greater parasympathetic resilience and a better ability to switch between 'fight/flight' and 'rest/digest'.",
                "A sign of impending cardiac arrest in chronic pain patients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates a healthy, flexible autonomic nervous system with strong vagal (parasympathetic) influence, allowing the body to recover from stress more efficiently."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Coherent Breathing (L4) is a primary tool for CNS stabilization. What is the scientifically recommended breath rate to maximize resonance frequency?",
            "options": [
                "12-15 breaths per minute.",
                "1-2 breaths per minute.",

                "As fast as the client can comfortably inhale."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that breathing at a rate of approximately 5.5 to 6 breaths per minute (roughly 5 seconds in, 5 seconds out) optimizes the resonance frequency of the cardiovascular system and increases HRV."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In Mindfulness-Based Pain Management (L5), how is 'Secondary Suffering' defined?",
            "options": [
                "The actual physical sensation of pain caused by nerve damage.",
                "The pain felt by the family members of the Fibromyalgia patient.",

                "The side effects caused by pharmaceutical pain interventions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Primary suffering is the raw physical sensation; secondary suffering is the 'mental overlay'—the thoughts and emotions that amplify the distress of the physical pain."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "What is the primary objective when a client is performing 'Somatic Tracking' (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "To accurately rate the pain on a scale of 1-10 to track progress.",
                "To observe the pain with 'detached curiosity' and safety, teaching the brain that the sensation is not a threat.",
                "To distract the brain by focusing on external sounds and sights.",
                "To push through the pain until the sensation disappears completely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Tracking aims to re-contextualize pain as a 'misinterpreted sensation' rather than a 'danger signal' by observing it without judgment or the intent to change it."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Why must Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) be modified for Fibromyalgia clients (L7)?",
            "options": [
                "Fibromyalgia clients cannot mentally focus long enough for standard PMR.",
                "Standard PMR requires standing, which most FM clients cannot do.",
                "Strongly tensing muscles can trigger a 'flare' or increased guarding in sensitized systems.",
                "PMR is only effective for athletes, not chronic pain patients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Traditional PMR involves 100% muscle contraction; for FM specialists, we recommend 'Micro-PMR' (5-10% tension) to avoid over-stimulating a hyper-reactive nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "The 'RESTORE' framework (L8) suggests that regulation should be 'proactive.' What does this mean in practice for a coach?",
            "options": [
                "The client should only use breathwork when they are in the middle of a major flare.",
                "The client should wait until their stress level is at an 8/10 before meditating.",
                "The client schedules 'micro-breaks' for regulation throughout the day, regardless of current pain levels.",
                "The coach should do the breathing for the client during sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proactive regulation involves 'toning' the nervous system throughout the day with micro-breaks, rather than using regulation tools only as a 'rescue' during high-stress moments."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Hyper-vigilance,' an exaggerated startle response, and cold extremities. Which state of 'Overdrive' are they likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown.",
                "Sympathetic Dominance.",

                "Parasympathetic Excess."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyper-vigilance, startle responses, and vasoconstriction (cold hands/feet) are classic clinical markers of the sympathetic nervous system (fight/flight) being in overdrive."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (L3), which branch of the nervous system is responsible for the 'freeze' or 'fainting' response in extreme trauma or pain?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex.",
                "The Sympathetic-Adrenal Medullary axis.",
                "The Unmyelinated Dorsal Vagal Complex.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal Complex is the evolutionarily older branch of the vagus nerve that handles 'immobilization' responses like freezing, fainting, or dissociation when the system is overwhelmed."
