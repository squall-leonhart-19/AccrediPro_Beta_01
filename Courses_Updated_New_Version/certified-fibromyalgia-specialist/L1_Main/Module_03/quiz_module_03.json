            "question": "Which physiological phenomenon involves the intrusion of fast-wave brain activity into slow-wave sleep, preventing Fibromyalgia patients from reaching deep, restorative stages?",
            "options": [
                "Beta-Theta Convergence",
                "Alpha-Delta Anomaly",
                "Gamma-Spindle Interruption",
                "Delta-Rem Displacement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Alpha-Delta Anomaly is a hallmark of FM sleep, where alpha waves (associated with wakefulness) intrude upon delta waves (deep sleep), leading to non-restorative sleep."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In the context of circadian dysregulation, how does blue light exposure specifically impact the CNS of a Fibromyalgia patient?",
            "options": [
                "It increases cortisol levels immediately upon exposure.",
                "It stimulates the production of substance P in the spinal cord.",
                "It suppresses melatonin production by signaling the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) that it is daytime.",
                "It triggers the release of adenosine, causing premature fatigue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blue light enters the retina and signals the SCN (the body's master clock) to suppress melatonin, which is often already dysregulated in FM patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Adenosine is a neurochemical critical for 'sleep pressure.' Why must a Fibromyalgia specialist be cautious when recommending increased activity to build adenosine?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive activity can trigger Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) and a pain flare, counteracting sleep benefits.",
                "Adenosine levels are naturally too high in FM patients.",
                "Activity decreases adenosine levels in the basal forebrain.",
                "Adenosine only builds up during REM sleep, not during wakefulness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While activity builds adenosine (sleep drive), FM patients must pace carefully because over-exertion can trigger a systemic flare that prevents sleep."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "For a client suffering from tactile allodynia, which environmental modification is recommended for their sleep space?",
            "options": [
                "High-wattage full-spectrum lighting.",
                "Heavy wool blankets for maximum pressure.",
                "Low-friction, high-thread-count bamboo or silk sheets.",
                "Increasing the room temperature to 75°F (24°C)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tactile allodynia makes heavy or rough fabrics painful; smooth, low-friction fabrics like bamboo or silk minimize sensory irritation during the night."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Magnesium is frequently recommended for FM sleep optimization. What is its primary biochemical mechanism in the context of central sensitization?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as an agonist for the NMDA receptor to increase pain signaling.",
                "It acts as a physiological calcium channel blocker and NMDA receptor antagonist.",
                "It directly converts into serotonin in the gut.",
                "It stimulates the release of adrenaline to regulate the morning 'slump'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium blocks the NMDA receptor, which helps reduce the 'wind-up' phenomenon of central sensitization and promotes neuromuscular relaxation."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client reports 'painsomnia'—the inability to sleep due to pain, which then increases their anxiety. This cycle is best managed psychologically through which technique?",
            "options": [
                "Intense aerobic exercise 30 minutes before bed.",
                "Cognitive Reframing and 'Worry Windows' to decouple pain from catastrophe.",
                "Staying in bed until sleep occurs, regardless of how long it takes.",
                "Increasing caffeine intake in the afternoon to stay alert."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive techniques like 'Worry Windows' help manage the racing thoughts and anxiety that exacerbate the perception of pain during the night."

            "question": "The 'Digital Sunset' protocol suggests discontinuing screen use how long before the intended sleep time?",
            "options": [
                "15 minutes",
                "3 hours",
                "60 to 90 minutes",
                "Exactly 5 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 60 to 90-minute digital sunset allows the brain to transition away from blue light and stimulating content, facilitating natural melatonin rise."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "What is 'orthosomnia,' a risk identified in Lesson 8 regarding sleep tracking?",
            "options": [
                "A condition where a patient sleeps too many hours.",
                "The inability to sleep without a prescription sedative.",
                "An unhealthy obsession with achieving 'perfect' sleep data from wearable devices.",
                "A physical deformity caused by poor sleeping posture."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orthosomnia occurs when patients become so anxious about their sleep tracker data that the stress itself causes further sleep disruption."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Which stage of sleep is most critical for the release of Growth Hormone (GH) and tissue repair, which are often deficient in FM patients?",
            "options": [
                "Stage 1 (Light Sleep)",
                "Stage 2 (Sleep Spindles)",
                "Stage 3/4 (Slow-Wave Sleep)",
                "REM (Rapid Eye Movement)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow-wave sleep (Stage 3/4) is when the body performs the majority of physical repair and growth hormone secretion; this stage is frequently interrupted in FM."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "If a client consumes caffeine at 4:00 PM and attempts to sleep at 10:00 PM, why is their sleep drive compromised despite the 6-hour gap?",
            "options": [
                "Caffeine has a half-life of approximately 5-6 hours, meaning 50% is still active.",
                "Caffeine permanently destroys adenosine receptors.",
                "Caffeine increases melatonin production, causing a circadian shift.",
                "Caffeine only affects the body for 30 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Because caffeine has a 5-6 hour half-life, a significant amount remains in the system to block adenosine receptors, preventing the brain from feeling the 'sleep pressure' needed to drift off."
