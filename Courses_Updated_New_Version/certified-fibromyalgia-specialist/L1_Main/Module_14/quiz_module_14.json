            "question": "According to the Gut-Brain Axis lesson, how does intestinal permeability (leaky gut) specifically contribute to neuro-inflammation in Fibromyalgia patients?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of serotonin in the enteric nervous system",
                "Through the translocation of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which trigger microglial activation in the CNS",
                "By decreasing the absorption of Vitamin C in the small intestine",
                "Through the direct inhibition of the vagus nerve's motor functions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxins) from gram-negative bacteria can cross a compromised intestinal barrier, enter systemic circulation, and cross the blood-brain barrier to activate microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, leading to neuro-inflammation."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the context of hormonal dysregulation, why do many female Fibromyalgia patients report 'flares' during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Rapidly rising estrogen levels increase muscle tone significantly",
                "Progesterone acts as a direct stimulant to the primary motor cortex",
                "The drop in estrogen and progesterone reduces the threshold for pain by modulating opioid receptor sensitivity",
                "Luteal phase hormones increase the rate of mitochondrial ATP production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fluctuations in sex hormones, particularly the drop in estrogen, can modulate the density and sensitivity of mu-opioid receptors and neurotransmitters like serotonin, effectively lowering the pain threshold."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "When utilizing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) for energy pacing, a significant decrease in the Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) indicates:",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is a primary metric for vagal tone (parasympathetic activity). A drop in RMSSD suggests the body is under stress and the autonomic nervous system is struggling to maintain homeostasis, signaling a need for rest."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which strategy is recommended for managing 'Sensory Overload' related to environmental toxins and stimuli in FM patients?",

                "Increasing caffeine intake to improve sensory processing speed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing sensory overload involves reducing the 'allostatic load' on the nervous system through environmental modifications like filtering blue light, using noise-canceling tools, and eliminating synthetic fragrances."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By addressing fascial restrictions and 'trigger points,' MFR reduces the constant stream of pain signals (nociception) sent from the periphery to the brain, which helps 'cool down' the overactive central nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Cognitive Reframing' when addressing 'Fibro Fog' and Executive Dysfunction?",

                "To improve long-term memory through rote memorization of complex lists",
                "To replace all medical treatments with positive thinking exercises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reframing for fibro fog focuses on acknowledging the neurological reality of the dysfunction while implementing practical 'scaffolding' like digital alerts, chunking tasks, and energy-aware scheduling."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These four nutrients play critical roles in the Electron Transport Chain (CoQ10), ATP structure (D-Ribose), enzymatic reactions (Magnesium), and fatty acid transport (L-Carnitine) within the mitochondria."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) score of 55 and consistently low HRV. Based on the Case Conceptualization lesson, what is the priority?",

                "Ignoring the HRV data as it is likely inaccurate in FM patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high CSI score (typically >40) and low HRV indicate a highly sensitized and stressed nervous system. The priority is stabilization and down-regulation to prevent further 'crashing' before introducing more intense stressors."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "According to the Mitochondrial Health lesson, what percentage of FM patients were found to have significantly lower levels of CoQ10 in a cited clinical study?",
            "options": [
