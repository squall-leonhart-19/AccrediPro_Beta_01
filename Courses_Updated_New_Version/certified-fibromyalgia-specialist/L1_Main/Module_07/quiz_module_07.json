            "question": "What is the primary objective of identifying 'Early Warning Systems' (EWS) in flare mapping?",
            "options": [
                "To provide evidence for disability claims",
                "To catch a flare in the prodromal phase and initiate early intervention",
                "To eliminate the need for all pharmacological support",
                "To prove to family members that symptoms are escalating"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early Warning Systems allow the patient to identify 'prodromal' symptoms (like sudden irritability or word-finding difficulties) before the full pain flare hits, allowing for preemptive management."

                "To return to high-intensity exercise immediately",
                "To maintain absolute bed rest for at least seven days",
                "To prevent the 'rebound effect' by gradually increasing activity without re-triggering symptoms",
                "To test the limits of the nervous system with sensory challenges"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Stabilization Phase is critical for preventing the 'rebound effect,' where a patient feels slightly better, overexerts themselves, and triggers a secondary, often worse, flare."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to environmental optimization principles, which factor is a common 'hidden' trigger for central sensitization in an office setting?",

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Recent research into the gut-brain axis in Fibromyalgia suggests that 'leaky gut' (increased intestinal permeability) contributes to pain through which mechanism?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased intestinal permeability allows substances like Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to enter the bloodstream, triggering systemic low-grade inflammation that exacerbates pain signaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "What defines a patient with high 'self-efficacy' in the context of the Expert Patient model?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Self-efficacy is the internal belief in one's ability to manage the condition, which is a stronger predictor of long-term success than any single clinical intervention."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "During seasonal shifts, which atmospheric change is most scientifically linked to increased pain reporting in Fibromyalgia patients?",

                "Increased UV index during summer",
                "Rapid drops in barometric pressure",
                "Consistent high-pressure systems",
                "High oxygen levels in coastal areas"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show that many FM patients are 'weather-sensitive,' with falling barometric pressure often correlating with increased joint and muscle pain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-transitioning involves breaking large stressors into small, manageable tasks with built-in recovery to prevent the cumulative load from triggering a flare."
