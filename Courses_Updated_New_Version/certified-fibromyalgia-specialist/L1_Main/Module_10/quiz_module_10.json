            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "In the Collaborative Care Model, what is defined as the 'primary gap' that the Fibromyalgia Specialist fills between the physician and the patient?",
            "options": [
                "The prescription of pharmacological interventions",
                "The diagnostic validation of tender points",
                "The implementation of behavioral and lifestyle self-regulation strategies",
                "The surgical referral process for comorbid conditions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While physicians focus on diagnosis and pharmacological management, the Specialist fills the gap of 'implementation science'—helping the patient actually execute lifestyle changes like pacing and sleep hygiene."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "When Fibromyalgia is comorbid with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), what is a key clinical distinction the Specialist must recognize?",
            "options": [
                "FM pain is primarily due to joint inflammation, whereas SLE is neurological",
                "FM symptoms do not typically respond to the immunosuppressants used to treat SLE flares",
                "SLE pain is widespread and non-articular, while FM is localized to joints",
                "SLE patients are immune to central sensitization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In comorbid cases, immunosuppressants may control the lupus-driven inflammation, but the central sensitization (FM) remains, requiring the RESTORE framework to address the non-inflammatory pain component."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to the research on Juvenile Fibromyalgia (JFM) in Lesson 3, which factor is most predictive of long-term disability in adolescents?",
            "options": [
                "The child's initial pain score",
                "The presence of school-based physical education",
                "Parental 'catastrophic thinking' and over-protection",
                "The age of the first symptom onset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that parental pain catastrophizing and protective behaviors can inadvertently reinforce the child's disability, making 'Family-Centered Integration' a critical part of the pediatric framework."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "What is the primary concern regarding 'Polypharmacy' in the aging fibromyalgia population?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of drug-drug interactions and cognitive 'brain fog' side effects",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Aging populations often take multiple medications; adding FM-specific drugs like gabapentinoids or TCAs can increase risks of falls, confusion, and adverse interactions."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5 on Workplace Ergonomics, what is the '20-20-20 Rule' adapted for Fibromyalgia specialists?",
            "options": [
                "20 minutes of work, 20 minutes of rest, 20 minutes of stretching",
                "Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds to reduce visual/nervous system strain",
                "20 reps of 20 different exercises every 20 hours",
                "A 20% reduction in workload for 20 weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 20-20-20 rule is a standard ergonomic practice to reduce eye strain and provide a 'micro-break' for the nervous system, preventing the accumulation of static postural load."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "During the 'Acute Phase' of the Rescue Protocol (Flare Management), what is the recommended approach to physical activity?",
            "options": [
                "Pushing through the pain to maintain the current routine",

                "High-intensity interval training to 'flush out' the flare"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Total bed rest can lead to stiffness and fear-avoidance, while pushing through can worsen the flare. 'Maintenance Minimums' keep the body moving without over-taxing the sensitized nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical trials have shown that 100-300mg of CoQ10 can improve mitochondrial bioenergetics, which is often impaired in FM patients, leading to reduced pain and fatigue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Months 4-6 focus on stability—ensuring the client has a predictable baseline and understands their personal thresholds before attempting to increase intensity in later phases."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PMR is a common 'mimicker' in the aging population (50+). Unlike FM, PMR involves high inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP) and responds dramatically to low-dose corticosteroids."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "When integrating with a client's workplace, what is the most effective 'Reasonable Accommodation' for a person with central sensitization?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flexible scheduling allows the FM patient to work during their 'peak energy' windows and utilize pacing strategies, which is more effective for long-term productivity than rigid hours."
