            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of central sensitization, what is the primary role of 'microglial activation' in the spinal cord?",
            "options": [
                "To provide structural support for neurons",
                "To release pro-inflammatory cytokines that lower the threshold for pain signaling",
                "To increase the production of GABA to inhibit pain",
                "To clear metabolic waste during deep sleep cycles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Microglia are the immune cells of the CNS; when activated, they release cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-1B, which sensitize dorsal horn neurons and contribute to 'wind-up' and chronic pain."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, a client who feels 'numb,' 'spaced out,' and physically heavy is likely dominant in which state?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Immobilization)",
                "The Flow State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the primitive 'freeze' response, characterized by bradycardia, low energy, dissociation, and a 'shutdown' of the system often seen in severe Fibromyalgia flares."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) for pacing, what does a high 'rMSSD' value typically indicate for a Fibromyalgia patient?",
            "options": [
                "The patient is in an active flare and should rest",
                "Greater parasympathetic tone and better readiness for activity",
                "High sympathetic stress and potential for a crash",
                "A dangerous cardiac arrhythmia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Higher rMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) generally reflects higher parasympathetic (vagal) activity, indicating the body is recovering well and has the resilience for movement."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "The 'Gut-Brain-Pain Axis' suggests that Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) contribute to pain by:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the absorption of Vitamin D",
                "Translocating from a 'leaky' gut into the bloodstream and triggering systemic neuroinflammation",
                "Directly repairing the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves",
                "Inhibiting the release of Substance P"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS are endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria; when they cross a compromised gut barrier, they trigger an immune response that can activate microglia in the brain, heightening pain sensitivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "What is the phenomenon of 'thixotropy' in myofascial dynamics, and why is it relevant to FM?",
            "options": [
                "The way muscles grow larger after resistance training",
                "The property where fascia becomes more fluid when moved and more gel-like when sedentary",
                "The permanent shortening of tendons due to lack of use",
                "The electrical conductivity of the skin during stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thixotropy explains why FM patients feel stiff after rest; the fascial ground substance thickens (gels) during inactivity and requires gentle, targeted movement to become fluid again."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In the Fear-Avoidance Model, what is the primary driver that leads from 'Pain Experience' to 'Disuse and Disability'?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity exercise",
                "Catastrophizing and pain-related fear",
                "Optimistic reframing",
                "Increased social support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Catastrophizing (misinterpreting pain as a sign of serious damage) leads to fear-avoidance behaviors, which results in physical deconditioning and increased sensitivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A client presents with Fibromyalgia, sudden hives, post-prandial tachycardia, and sensitivity to fermented foods. Which environmental trigger should be investigated?",

                "Electromagnetic Field (EMF) sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Histamine intolerance and MCAS often co-occur with FM, causing symptoms like flushing, heart palpitations, and digestive distress that mimic or exacerbate flares."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the RESTORE Integration framework for managing flares, what is the first priority during the 'S' (Stabilize) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Pushing through the pain to maintain a schedule",
                "Reducing sensory input and calming the nervous system",
                "Increasing caloric intake to boost energy",
                "Starting a new high-intensity supplement protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization focuses on down-regulating the overactive nervous system by reducing light, noise, and physical demands to prevent the flare from escalating."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Research indicates that approximately what percentage of Fibromyalgia patients exhibit Small Fiber Neuropathy (SFN) on skin biopsy?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Around 15%",
                "40% to 50%",
                "Over 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies have shown that roughly 40-50% of FM patients have objective evidence of small fiber neuropathy, suggesting a peripheral component to their central pain."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Which specific type of movement is most recommended in Lesson 5 to stimulate myofascial mechanoreceptors without triggering a flare?",
            "options": [
                "Maximal eccentric loading",
                "Slow, multi-planar, micro-movements (Slings/Hydration movement)",
                "High-impact plyometrics",
                "Static stretching held for over 5 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow, multi-planar micro-movements help hydrate the fascia and stimulate Ruffini endings and interstitial receptors, which helps lower sympathetic tone and reduce stiffness safely."
