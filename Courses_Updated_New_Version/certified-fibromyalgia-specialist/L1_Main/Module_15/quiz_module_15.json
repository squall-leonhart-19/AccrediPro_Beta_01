            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In the context of advanced neurobiology, which cell type acts as the primary 'immune architect' of central sensitization by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α?",
            "options": [
                "Oligodendrocytes",
                "Activated Microglia",
                "Schwann Cells",
                "Ependymal Cells",
                "Myelin Sheaths"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Activated microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS. When chronically activated, they release pro-inflammatory cytokines that lower the threshold for pain signaling, a hallmark of central sensitization."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A client with Fibromyalgia reports 'brain fog,' flushing, and sudden tachycardia after consuming aged cheeses and wine. Which comorbid condition should the specialist investigate?",

                "Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) / Histamine Intolerance",
                "Primary Hypothyroidism",
                "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)",
                "Osteoarthritis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Histamine intolerance and MCAS often co-occur with FM. Symptoms like flushing, tachycardia, and cognitive dysfunction (brain fog) after high-histamine foods are classic indicators of mast cell involvement."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Energy Envelope' theory discussed in Lesson 3, what is the primary goal of advanced energy pacing?",
            "options": [

                "Eliminating all physical movement until symptoms resolve"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Energy Envelope theory focuses on pacing to ensure that a client's 'Exertion' does not exceed their 'Available Energy,' thereby preventing Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "The glymphatic system, responsible for clearing metabolic waste from the brain, is most active during which stage of sleep?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Glymphatic clearance increases by up to 60% during deep, slow-wave sleep (Stage N3), making it critical for reducing neuroinflammation in FM patients."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Recent research into fascial health suggests that fascia acts as a massive sensory organ. Which type of receptors in the fascia are most linked to the diffuse, 'aching' pain in Fibromyalgia?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The fascia is densely populated with interoceptive C-fibers. Sensitization of these fibers contributes to the deep, widespread, and poorly localized pain characteristic of FM."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the RESTORE framework, 'Psychological Flexibility' (Lesson 6) is primarily built by addressing which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating all negative thoughts",
                "Reducing experiential avoidance and increasing value-based action",
                "Forcing positive affirmations during pain flares",
                "Distracting the mind from the body at all times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychological flexibility involves being present and moving toward values even in the presence of pain, rather than trying to 'avoid' or 'fix' every difficult internal experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coenzyme Q10 (electron transport), D-Ribose (substrate for ATP), and Magnesium (ATP cofactor) are foundational for addressing the cellular energy deficit in FM."

            "id": "q15_8",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resilience Cultivation (incorporating psychological flexibility and HPA-axis regulation) is a core pillar of the RESTORE framework for long-term management."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "How does chronic HPA-axis dysregulation (hypocortisolism) contribute to the 'vicious cycle' of Fibromyalgia pain?",
            "options": [
                "It causes excessive bone density",
                "It leads to an overactive anti-inflammatory response",
                "Low cortisol levels fail to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines, allowing neuroinflammation to persist",
                "It increases the speed of nerve conduction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a natural anti-inflammatory. When the HPA-axis is 'blunted' (low cortisol), the body loses its ability to dampen the systemic and neuro-inflammation that drives FM symptoms."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which movement strategy is recommended in Lesson 5 to address fascial densification without triggering a 'flare'?",

                "Static stretching held for 10 minutes per muscle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fascial 'gliding' and gentle multi-planar micro-movements help hydrate the extracellular matrix and reduce densification without the high metabolic cost that triggers flares."
