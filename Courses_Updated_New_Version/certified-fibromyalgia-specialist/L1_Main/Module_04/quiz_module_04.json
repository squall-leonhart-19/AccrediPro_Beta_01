            "question": "In the context of Central Sensitization (CS), why does traditional high-intensity exercise often trigger a 'flare' in Fibromyalgia patients?",
            "options": [
                "Due to a lack of muscle glycogen storage in FM patients",
                "Due to impaired descending inhibitory pain pathways and exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) dysfunction",
                "Because FM patients have a higher percentage of Type IIb fast-twitch fibers",
                "Because of acute structural damage to the sarcolemma occurring at lower thresholds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In healthy individuals, exercise triggers Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia (EIH). In FM, this mechanism is often impaired or reversed (Exercise-Induced Hyperalgesia) due to dysfunctional descending inhibition in the central nervous system."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the Fear-Avoidance Model discussed in Lesson 2, what is the primary psychological mediator that leads from a pain experience to chronic disability?",
            "options": [
                "Low self-esteem",
                "Lack of social support",
                "Pain catastrophizing",
                "Clinical depression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pain catastrophizing is the primary driver in the Fear-Avoidance Model. It leads to kinesiophobia (fear of movement), which results in avoidance, disuse, and eventually disability."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "What is the fundamental distinction between Graded Activity (GA) and Graded Exercise Therapy (GET)?",
            "options": [
                "GA focuses on heart rate zones, while GET focuses on flexibility",
                "GA is based on operant conditioning and functional goals, while GET is based on physiological aerobic progression",
                "GET is only for athletes, while GA is for bedridden patients",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical literature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Graded Activity (GA) uses a behavioral approach (operant conditioning) to increase functional task performance regardless of pain, whereas Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) focuses on physiological deconditioning and aerobic capacity."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "When assessing a client's movement baseline, the 'Basal Activity Level' should be set at approximately what percentage of their 'good day' maximum capacity to avoid the 'Boom-Bust' cycle?",
            "options": [
                "90-100%",
                "75-85%",
                "50-70%",
                "10-20%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To ensure consistency and avoid flares, the baseline is typically set at 50-70% of what a client can do on a 'good day.' This provides a 'buffer' that prevents overexertion."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which specific property of aquatic therapy is most beneficial for reducing peripheral edema and improving proprioceptive feedback in FM clients?",
            "options": [
                "Thermal conductivity",
                "Hydrostatic pressure",
                "Buoyancy",
                "Viscosity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hydrostatic pressure exerts equal pressure on all parts of the immersed body, which aids venous return, reduces edema, and provides constant sensory input that can 'mute' pain signals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6's 'Micro-Dosing' resistance training protocol, what is the recommended 'RPE' (Rate of Perceived Exertion) limit for a beginner FM client?",
            "options": [
                "RPE 9-10 (Near failure)",
                "RPE 7-8 (Vigorous)",
                "RPE 3-5 (Moderate to Light)",
                "RPE 1-2 (Very Light)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For FM resistance training, the goal is to stay within an RPE of 3-5 initially. This allows for neuromuscular adaptation without triggering the systemic inflammatory response associated with high-intensity hypertrophy training."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Why is 'Aggressive Static Stretching' often counterproductive for a client with Fibromyalgia during a period of high sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "It causes permanent lengthening of the ligaments",
                "It can trigger the 'stretch reflex' and protective muscle guarding, leading to rebound hyperalgesia",
                "It decreases the temperature of the fascia too rapidly",
                "It has been shown to decrease ATP production in the mitochondria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aggressive stretching can be perceived as a threat by a sensitized nervous system, triggering a protective contraction (stretch reflex) that increases pain and muscle stiffness."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis comparing Tai Chi to aerobic exercise for Fibromyalgia (discussed in Lesson 5) concluded that:",
            "options": [
                "Tai Chi was significantly less effective than cycling",
                "Aerobic exercise is the only 'Gold Standard' for FM",
                "Tai Chi produced similar or greater improvement in symptoms compared to aerobic exercise",
                "Tai Chi increased the risk of falls in FM patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recent research, including a landmark study in the BMJ, found that Tai Chi was as effective as, or more effective than, aerobic exercise for managing FM symptoms, likely due to its mind-body integration."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "If a client experiences a 'flare' (significant increase in pain/fatigue) that lasts more than 48 hours after a movement session, how should the Targeted Movement Plan be adjusted?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain the current intensity to 'push through' the sensitivity",
                "Stop all movement for 14 days",
                "Reduce the volume or intensity by 50% once symptoms return to baseline",
                "Switch exclusively to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to reset the nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The '48-hour rule' suggests that if recovery takes longer than two days, the previous dose was too high. The practitioner should reduce the next session's volume/intensity by 50% to find a tolerable threshold."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which fascial layer is most densely populated with nociceptors and is a primary target for gentle, restorative movement in FM?",
            "options": [
                "Deep Fascia",
                "Superficial Fascia",
                "Epimysium",
                "Periosteum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The superficial fascia is highly innervated with sensory receptors and nociceptors. In FM, this layer often becomes 'densified,' and gentle movement helps restore glide and reduce sensory 'noise' from this tissue."
