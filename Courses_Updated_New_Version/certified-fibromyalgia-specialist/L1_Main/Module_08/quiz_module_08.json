            "options": [
                "Root Assessment; to map the unique landscape of triggers and physiological imbalances.",
                "Rapid Recovery; to provide immediate pain relief through pharmacological intervention.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The RESTORE Framework begins with Root Assessment, which focuses on mapping the complex, individualized landscape of a client's fibromyalgia, rather than just treating surface symptoms."

            "question": "During Lesson 2 (Root Assessment), we discussed 'The Fibromyalgia Landscape.' Which tool is most effective for measuring the degree of nervous system sensitization?",
            "options": [
                "The McGill Pain Questionnaire",
                "The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)",
                "The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI)",
                "The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) is specifically designed to assess symptoms associated with central sensitization, which is the core mechanism of fibromyalgia."

            "question": "Lesson 3 introduces the '70% Rule' in Energy Pacing. What is the core principle of this rule?",
            "options": [
                "Clients should perform at 70% intensity during every workout.",
                "Clients should stop their activity when they feel they have used 70% of their available energy for the day.",
                "Clients must spend 70% of their day in a reclined or sleeping position.",
                "Clients should aim to reduce their medication dosage by 70% through pacing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 70% Rule is a pacing strategy where clients stop an activity while they still have a 30% 'buffer' of energy left, preventing the 'crash' associated with Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is a waste clearance system in the brain that becomes highly active during deep sleep, 'washing' the brain of neurotoxic waste products."

            "question": "A client (Sarah) experiences a significant flare-up 24 hours after a 20-minute walk. According to Lesson 5, what does this 'delayed' response most likely indicate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A delayed flare-up after physical activity is a hallmark sign of Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), indicating the client exceeded their current metabolic battery capacity."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 focuses on 'Overdrive Regulation.' How does a low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reading typically correlate with a fibromyalgia client's state?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates a healthy, dominant parasympathetic nervous system.",
                "It suggests the client is in a state of 'Rest and Digest.'",
                "It indicates sympathetic dominance and a sensitized 'overdrive' state.",
                "It has no clinical significance in fibromyalgia management."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low HRV is a biomarker of a stressed autonomic nervous system, indicating that the 'fight or flight' (sympathetic) branch is dominant and the system lacks resilience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Psychological flexibility, a core component of ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), involves being present and taking action aligned with one's values, even when pain is present."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the 'Yellow Light' phase of the Flare Prevention System?",
            "options": [
                "A state of total remission where no symptoms are present.",
                "A full-blown flare requiring complete bed rest and emergency protocols.",
                "The early warning signs (subtle increase in fatigue or brain fog) where intervention can prevent a 'Red Light' flare.",
                "The phase where a client begins a new, high-intensity exercise program."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Yellow Light' phase represents prodromal symptoms. Recognizing these early signs allows for immediate 'pivoting'—reducing demands to prevent a full 'Red Light' flare."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 4 suggests that even a single night of sleep deprivation can increase pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) by approximately:",

                "5-10%",
                "25-30%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that sleep deprivation significantly amplifies pain perception, with even one poor night increasing sensitivity by roughly 25-30%."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Which movement strategy is recommended in Lesson 5 for a client currently in a high-sensitivity 'Overdrive' state?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) to 'reset' the system.",
                "Long-distance steady-state cardio to build endurance.",
                "Micro-dosed, non-aerobic movement such as gentle isometrics or mobility flow.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For highly sensitized clients, 'micro-dosed' movement that stays below the aerobic threshold is essential to maintain mobility without triggering the sympathetic 'overdrive' or PEM."
