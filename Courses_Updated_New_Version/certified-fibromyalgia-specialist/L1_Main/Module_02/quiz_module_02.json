            "question": "What physiological phenomenon is the primary driver of the 'Bust' phase in the Boom-Bust cycle, often occurring 24-48 hours after overexertion?",
            "options": [
                "Acute Adrenal Fatigue",
                "Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)",
                "Lactic Acid Toxicity",
                "Immediate Glycogen Depletion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) is the hallmark of the 'Bust' phase, characterized by a delayed systemic flare-up of symptoms following physical, mental, or emotional overexertion."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to 'The Spoon Theory,' why is energy budgeting more complex for a Fibromyalgia patient than a healthy individual?",
            "options": [
                "Healthy people have an infinite number of spoons.",
                "Fibromyalgia patients lose spoons while sleeping.",
                "Healthy people perform most tasks 'automatically' without a conscious energy cost.",
                "Fibromyalgia patients have larger spoons but fewer of them."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For healthy individuals, daily tasks like showering or dressing are 'automatic' and don't require conscious energy calculation. For those with Fibromyalgia, every single action has a specific, non-negotiable cost from a limited daily budget."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client spends two hours ruminating on a stressful email they received. Which type of energy leak is this primarily categorized as?",
            "options": [
                "Physical Leak",
                "Cognitive/Emotional Leak",
                "Sensory Leak",
                "Environmental Leak"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional looping, rumination, and high-stress cognitive processing are significant energy leaks that can deplete a client's physical 'spoons' just as quickly as physical exercise."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "When applying the '70% Rule' to activity pacing, what is the core instruction given to the client?",
            "options": [
                "Only complete 70% of your weekly to-do list.",
                "Stop your activity when you feel you have 30% of your energy left in the tank.",
                "Ensure 70% of your day is spent in total bed rest.",
                "Increase your activity level by 70% every time you have a 'good day'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 70% Rule advises clients to stop while they still have a 30% reserve ('leaving some fuel in the tank') to prevent triggering the sympathetic nervous system and a subsequent crash."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Strategic Rest' as opposed to 'Reactive Crashing'?",
            "options": [
                "Resting only when the pain becomes unbearable.",
                "Taking a nap for 4 hours in the middle of the afternoon.",
                "Pre-planned, short rest intervals taken *before* symptoms escalate.",
                "Using caffeine to delay rest until the end of the day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic rest is proactive and scheduled, occurring before the body forces a 'Reactive Crash.' This helps maintain a more stable baseline and prevents the Boom-Bust cycle."
        },

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'brain fog' and exhaustion after a 30-minute grocery shopping trip. Which 'Positioning' strategy (from the 3 Ps) would most likely help?",
            "options": [
                "Prioritizing the shopping trip for Monday mornings.",
                "Planning the route through the store to be more efficient.",
                "Using a motorized cart or sitting on a stool while bagging items to reduce postural strain.",
                "Choosing a different grocery store with better lighting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Position' element of the 3 Ps involves modifying body mechanics or the environment—such as sitting instead of standing—to reduce the orthostatic and physical demands of a task."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "In the context of wearable technology, a consistently low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reading in the morning suggests that the client:",
            "options": [
                "Is well-rested and should increase their activity for the day.",
                "Has high cardiovascular fitness.",
                "Is in a state of sympathetic dominance and should prioritize rest/pacing.",
                "Needs to recalibrate their device."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low HRV indicates that the autonomic nervous system is under stress (sympathetic dominance). In Fibromyalgia pacing, this is a signal to reduce activity and focus on recovery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which strategy is recommended for managing 'Social Energy' during high-stimulation events like weddings or holidays?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Sensory Time-Out' (scheduled breaks in a quiet, dark room).",
                "Increasing physical activity the day before to 'build up' stamina.",
                "Avoiding all social interaction entirely.",
                "Engaging in multiple conversations simultaneously to get them over with faster."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Scheduled 'sensory time-outs' allow the overstimulated nervous system to decompress, preventing the sensory overload that often leads to a crash in Fibromyalgia patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "To establish a safe 'Activity Baseline,' a coach should help the client find a level of activity that:",
            "options": [
                "They can perform on their absolute best day.",
                "They can perform consistently every day, even on a 'bad' day, without crashing.",
                "Is exactly 50% of what a healthy person their age can do.",
                "Challenges them to the point of mild pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The baseline is the 'floor'—the amount of activity the client can safely sustain even during a flare-up. This provides a stable foundation to build upon without triggering the Boom-Bust cycle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Why is the 'Boom' phase of the cycle considered a 'false window' of energy?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client is imagining the energy.",
                "Because it is usually driven by an adrenaline surge (stress response) rather than true cellular recovery.",
                "Because it only lasts for exactly 15 minutes.",
                "Because it only occurs in clients who are misdiagnosed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Boom' is often a result of 'adrenaline pushing,' where the body uses stress hormones to override fatigue. This creates a false sense of wellness that leads to overexertion and an inevitable crash."
