            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Top-down regulation focuses on using higher-order cognitive processes (prefrontal cortex) to modulate and inhibit the overactive limbic system (amygdala) response common in fibromyalgia."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
