            "question": "When a client enters a 'Red Zone' flare, which intervention strategy is prioritized to prevent the exacerbation of central sensitization?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing aerobic exercise intensity to 'flush out' cytokines",
                "Relative Rest and strict pacing to stay within the 'Energy Envelope'",
                "Complete bed rest for a minimum of 48 hours",
                "Immediate cessation of all pharmacological interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relative rest and pacing are critical during a Red Zone flare to prevent the 'boom-bust' cycle and further nervous system exhaustion."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In a client with multi-morbidity (Fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis), which clinical finding most likely indicates an inflammatory flare rather than a Fibromyalgia flare?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fibromyalgia is typically non-inflammatory; elevated ESR or CRP and visible joint swelling point toward an active autoimmune/inflammatory process like RA."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is the priority; the specialist must assess the level of risk (intent, plan, and means) before determining the appropriate level of referral."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Both Tramadol and SNRIs increase serotonin levels; their concurrent use significantly raises the risk of Serotonin Syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Freeze' response is a dorsal vagal state of immobilization and shutdown, often triggered when the system perceives a threat it cannot escape."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a client shows no progress after 6 months of consistent, high-quality care, they are classified as a non-responder, requiring a deep-dive re-evaluation of secondary diagnoses."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unilateral weakness or facial drooping are signs of a stroke or neurological crisis, whereas word-finding and memory issues are typical of Fibro-fog."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In permanent disability cases, the focus shifts from 'cure' to 'management,' emphasizing quality of life, adaptive tools, and functional preservation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "OSA is highly prevalent in FM and can prevent any meaningful recovery if left untreated, as it constantly triggers the stress response during sleep."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "During a trauma-informed 'Freeze' response, why might a client report 'Dissociative Anaesthesia' (numbness to pain)?",

                "The Fibromyalgia has been spontaneously cured",
                "The body has released endogenous opioids to numb the system during a perceived threat",

                "The central sensitization has shifted to the peripheral nerves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociative Anaesthesia is a survival mechanism where the brain numbs physical and emotional pain during a state of high dorsal vagal shutdown."
