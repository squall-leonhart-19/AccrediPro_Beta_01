            "options": [
                "Maximizing caloric expenditure for weight loss",
                "Reducing systemic inflammation and calming the sympathetic nervous system",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RESTORE Framework™ emphasizes stabilizing the autonomic nervous system and reducing inflammation as a prerequisite for more intensive interventions to avoid triggering flares."

            "options": [
                "It is the easiest habit for clients to change",
                "It has no impact on pain levels",
                "Metabolic repair and hormonal regulation are dependent on restorative sleep cycles",
                "It allows the coach to bill for more hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circadian alignment is foundational; without restorative sleep, the body lacks the metabolic capacity to recover from movement or nutritional changes."

            "question": "When customizing a program for the 'Central Sensitization Dominant' phenotype, which intervention is most critical?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phenotypes dominated by central sensitization require careful management of the total 'allostatic load,' including light, sound, and sensory inputs, to prevent nervous system overwhelm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 50% rule is a pacing tool designed to prevent the 'boom-bust' cycle by ensuring the client always keeps energy in reserve for systemic recovery."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Isometrics allow for muscle activation without the high neurological demand of joint movement, making them the safest starting point for highly sensitized individuals."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Yellow Zone represents the appearance of early warning signs (prodrome); this is where mitigation strategies must be deployed to prevent a full 'Red Zone' flare."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV provides a non-invasive window into the balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, making it ideal for monitoring fibromyalgia recovery."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Community design in fibromyalgia programs helps downregulate the threat response by providing social safety and validation, which are clinically shown to improve outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Those with metabolic/mitochondrial dysfunction have limited ATP recycling; short bursts of activity followed by full recovery prevent the metabolic 'crash' associated with this phenotype."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A significant increase in FIQR scores indicates the current load exceeds the client's adaptive capacity, requiring a strategic regression to stabilize the nervous system."
