            "question": "In the 'Unified Field' synthesis of the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework, what is the primary purpose of integrating biological, psychological, and environmental data into a single narrative?",
            "options": [
                "To determine which single factor is the root cause of the patient's pain",
                "To identify the 'Central Sensitization Driver' and determine the hierarchy of intervention",
                "To replace the need for medical diagnosis with a lifestyle-only approach",
                "To simplify the protocol so that all patients receive the exact same supplement regimen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Unified Field approach seeks to identify the primary drivers of central sensitization (whether they be metabolic, autonomic, or psychological) to prioritize which part of the RESTORE framework to implement first."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "A client presents with Fibromyalgia, POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), and suspected MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome). According to clinical reasoning priorities, which should be addressed FIRST?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity aerobic exercise to improve cardiovascular fitness",
                "Aggressive detoxification protocols to clear heavy metals",
                "Stabilizing the 'Triad' through mast cell quenching and autonomic calming",
                "Deep tissue massage to release myofascial trigger points"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex co-morbid cases (The Triad), stabilization is the priority. High-intensity exercise or aggressive detox can trigger MCAS degranulation or POTS flares, worsening the overall clinical picture."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "When synthesizing biomarker trends, a 'Stable Baseline' is best identified by which of the following data patterns?",
            "options": [
                "A single high HRV reading after a weekend of rest",
                "A 14-day rolling average of HRV with less than 15% daily variance",
                "The absence of pain for 48 consecutive hours",
                "A resting heart rate that fluctuates by 20 beats per minute daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Objective data synthesis relies on trends rather than snapshots. A rolling average with low variance indicates physiological stability and a resilient nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "In Advanced CNS Down-Regulation, the concept of 'Neuroplastic Pruning' refers to:",
            "options": [
                "Surgically removing nerves that transmit pain signals",
                "The natural death of neurons due to chronic stress",
                "Weakening the synaptic pathways that maintain the 'Danger' signal through targeted inhibitory behaviors",
                "Using supplements to increase Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) without behavioral change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity allows us to 'prune' or weaken the neural pathways associated with chronic pain by consistently signaling safety to the CNS and reducing the reinforcement of pain pathways."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "During a 'Level 4 Flare' (Severe/Systemic), what is the most appropriate recommendation regarding the client's 'Signature Protocol'?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the dosage of all stimulating supplements to fight fatigue",
                "Implement 'Pacing Level Zero': Sensory reduction, minimal cognitive load, and anti-inflammatory support",
                "Push through the pain to maintain the exercise habit and prevent deconditioning",
                "Immediately stop all protocols and wait for the flare to pass without intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Severe flares require 'Pacing Level Zero,' which focuses on radical CNS conservation. Stimulating the system or pushing through pain during a systemic flare often leads to prolonged relapse."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "As a Collaborative Care Leader (Case Manager), what is the specialist's most critical role when a client's Physical Therapist suggests increasing resistance training intensity?",
            "options": [
                "To defer entirely to the Physical Therapist as they have more clinical schooling",
                "To tell the client to ignore the Physical Therapist's advice",
                "To provide the PT with the client's 'Energy Envelope' data and current flare-risk biomarkers to ensure the load is appropriate",
                "To take over the Physical Therapy duties themselves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Specialist acts as the integrator, ensuring that other practitioners understand the client's unique CNS limitations (the Energy Envelope) to prevent well-intentioned interventions from causing flares."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "In the development of a 'Signature RESTORE Protocol,' why is the 'Order of Operations' considered more important than the specific supplements used?",
            "options": [
                "Supplements don't actually work in Fibromyalgia cases",
                "The CNS must be stabilized before metabolic or structural interventions can be tolerated without triggering a flare",
                "The Order of Operations is required for insurance billing purposes",
                "It is not more important; the specific supplements are the only thing that matters"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A hypersensitive CNS will often react negatively to 'good' interventions (like nutrients or exercise) if they are introduced before the system has achieved a baseline of safety and stability."

        {
            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "Which objective metric is most indicative of an impending 'Relapse' before the client actually feels increased pain?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden 20% drop in 7-day HRV baseline despite no change in activity",
                "A slight increase in muscle soreness after a new workout",
                "A single night of poor sleep (less than 6 hours)",
                "The client feeling 'too energetic' and wanting to clean the whole house"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in HRV baseline often precedes symptomatic flares by 24-72 hours, serving as an early warning system for the practitioner to adjust the load."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "When integrating CFS/ME management into a Fibromyalgia protocol, the '90% Rule' of energy expenditure suggests:",
            "options": [
                "The client should use 90% of their perceived energy every day",
                "The client should aim to stay at 90% of their heart rate maximum during exercise",
                "The client should never exceed 90% of their 'perceived' energy capacity to avoid Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)",
                "90% of Fibromyalgia clients also have CFS/ME"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To prevent the 'boom-bust' cycle and PEM, clients with CFS/ME integration are often taught to stop activity when they feel they have 10% of their energy left, staying within their 'envelope.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "What defines 'Mastery' in the context of the Certified Fibromyalgia Specialist™ credential?",
            "options": [
                "Memorizing every possible pharmaceutical interaction",
                "The ability to synthesize complex data into a fluid, adaptive protocol that evolves with the client's physiological state",
                "Curing every patient within 12 weeks of starting the program",
                "Using only high-tech wearable data and ignoring the client's subjective experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery is the transition from 'following a template' to 'clinical reasoning'—the ability to adapt the RESTORE framework based on the real-time synthesis of objective data and subjective feedback."
