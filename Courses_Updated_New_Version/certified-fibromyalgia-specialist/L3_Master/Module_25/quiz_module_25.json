            "question": "In Proctor’s Three-Function Model of Supervision, which function is specifically concerned with the administrative and ethical 'gatekeeping' of the Certified Fibromyalgia Specialist™ standards?",
            "options": ["The Formative Function", "The Restorative Function", "The Normative Function", "The Integrative Function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Normative function (also known as the administrative function) focuses on quality control, ethics, and ensuring the specialist adheres to professional standards and protocols."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "When mentoring a trainee on the 'E' (Education) component of the RESTORE Framework™, what is the primary risk of 'Protocol Drift'?",
            "options": ["The client becomes too knowledgeable about their condition", "The coach provides overly medicalized explanations that increase catastrophizing", "The coach spends too much time on pacing instead of education", "The trainee fails to bill the client correctly"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protocol drift in the Education phase often leads to 'expert-led' medicalization, which can inadvertently increase client anxiety or catastrophizing rather than empowering them through the RESTORE model."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "An L3 Specialist observes a trainee experiencing 'Therapeutic Nihilism'—a belief that the client with severe Fibromyalgia will never improve. This is a classic example of:",
            "options": ["Countertransference", "Transference", "Positive Reinforcement", "Cognitive Dissonance"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner's own emotional reactions or biases (like hopelessness) are projected onto the client or the therapeutic process."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "In an Advanced Case Review for a 'stuck' case, which strategy is recommended to break the cycle of client non-adherence?",
            "options": ["Increasing the intensity of the RESTORE protocol immediately", "Utilizing Collaborative Consultation to identify hidden barriers or secondary gains", "Terminating the coaching relationship for lack of progress", "Assigning more rigorous homework to test the client's commitment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collaborative Consultation allows the supervisor and trainee to look at the case from multiple angles to identify psychological or systemic barriers that the trainee may have missed."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "According to Quality Assurance standards for L3 Specialists, what is the difference between 'Adherence' and 'Competence' in protocol fidelity?",
            "options": ["Adherence is doing the right things; Competence is doing them well", "Adherence is for L1 coaches; Competence is for L3 supervisors", "They are identical terms in clinical supervision", "Adherence refers to the client; Competence refers to the coach"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Adherence measures whether the coach followed the steps of the protocol, while competence measures the skill, timing, and relational quality with which those steps were delivered."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical oversight requires the supervisor to ensure the trainee stays within their scope of practice; recommending specific supplements often crosses into medical or nutritional licensure territory."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
