            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "Research on Juvenile Fibromyalgia (JFM) suggests a high rate of symptom persistence. Approximately what percentage of adolescents diagnosed with JFM continue to meet the diagnostic criteria for adult Fibromyalgia in their early 20s?",
            "options": ["25-30%", "50-55%", "80-85%", "95-100%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal studies indicate that approximately 80% of adolescents with JFM continue to struggle with chronic pain and meet adult FM criteria into adulthood, highlighting the need for early, aggressive intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "When working with geriatric FM patients (age 65+), which class of medication is generally discouraged due to the high risk of anticholinergic side effects, cognitive impairment, and increased fall risk?",
            "options": ["SSRIs (e.g., Duloxetine)", "TCAs (e.g., Amitriptyline)", "Gabapentinoids (e.g., Pregabalin)", "Low-dose Naltrexone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) like Amitriptyline are often avoided in the elderly because their anticholinergic effects can cause confusion, dry mouth, urinary retention, and significantly increase the risk of falls."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "A client with Fibromyalgia is planning a pregnancy. Based on clinical data, which period is statistically associated with the highest risk of a significant symptom flare-up?",
            "options": ["The first trimester", "The second trimester", "The third trimester", "The postpartum period (first 3-6 months)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While symptoms may fluctuate during pregnancy, the postpartum period is the most high-risk time for flares due to rapid hormonal shifts, sleep deprivation, and the physical demands of newborn care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Occupational Mastery,' what is the primary goal of implementing 'Micro-breaks' (e.g., the 20/20/20 rule or 5-minute stretches) for a professional with FM?",
            "options": ["To increase total billable hours", "To prevent static muscle loading and 'lock-in' pain", "To satisfy legal requirements for the ADA", "To replace the need for aerobic exercise"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-breaks prevent static loading, which is a major trigger for FM pain. Regularly changing posture and moving helps maintain blood flow to muscles and reduces the buildup of peripheral nociceptive signals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "For high-performance athletes with FM, what is the 'Window of Opportunity' regarding exercise intensity?",
            "options": ["Training only during the morning hours", "Training at 100% capacity during a flare to 'break' the cycle", "Adjusting intensity to stay below the threshold of Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)", "Using high-impact plyometrics to desensitize the nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Athletes must find the 'Goldilocks Zone'—an intensity high enough to maintain fitness but low enough to avoid triggering Post-Exertional Malaise or a central nervous system 'crash.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Fibromyalgia frequently overlaps with autoimmune conditions. Approximately what percentage of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are estimated to have comorbid Fibromyalgia?",
            "options": ["Less than 5%", "Around 10%", "Approximately 25-30%", "Over 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that about 25-30% of SLE patients also meet the criteria for FM, which can complicate the assessment of disease activity in Lupus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Why is the Beighton Score relevant to the assessment of a Fibromyalgia client?",
            "options": ["It measures cognitive 'fibro-fog' levels", "It screens for joint hypermobility, which is a common comorbidity (hEDS)", "It calculates the dosage for Vitamin D supplementation", "It measures the pressure threshold of tender points"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Beighton Score is a standard screening tool for generalized joint hypermobility. There is a significant overlap between Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders (HSD/hEDS) and FM, requiring different physical therapy approaches."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "To minimize the risk of a post-surgical 'wind-up' or chronic pain amplification, what perioperative strategy is specifically recommended for FM patients?",
            "options": ["Complete cessation of all FM medications 2 weeks before surgery", "The use of aggressive opioid therapy only", "Pre-emptive analgesia and NMDA antagonists like Ketamine during anesthesia", "Avoiding all forms of physical therapy for 6 weeks post-op"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pre-emptive analgesia and the use of NMDA antagonists (like Ketamine) help 'quiet' the central nervous system during surgery, preventing the central sensitization 'wind-up' that often leads to prolonged FM flares after procedures."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Robert is a 70-year-old male with FM and severe osteoarthritis. He reports a sudden increase in morning stiffness (lasting >1 hour) and pain in his shoulders and hips. His ESR (sedimentation rate) is significantly elevated. What should the specialist suspect?",
            "options": ["A standard FM flare", "Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR)", "Early-onset Alzheimer's", "Sarcopenia"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory condition in seniors that mimics FM but is characterized by high inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP) and responds rapidly to low-dose corticosteroids, unlike FM."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "In pregnant FM patients, why is 'Aquatic Therapy' often considered a gold-standard intervention?",
            "options": ["It eliminates the need for any prenatal vitamins", "It provides hydrostatic pressure that reduces edema while offloading joints", "It is the only way to increase heart rate safely", "It prevents the development of gestational diabetes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aquatic therapy is ideal during pregnancy because the buoyancy offloads the weight on the spine and pelvis, while the hydrostatic pressure helps reduce pregnancy-related edema (swelling) and provides a soothing sensory environment."
