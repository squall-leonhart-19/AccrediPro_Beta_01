            "question": "According to the Neuro-Social Dynamics of Fibromyalgia, what is the primary physiological benefit of 'Co-regulation' within a group setting?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for individual pharmacological intervention.",
                "It activates the ventral vagal complex, lowering the threshold for central sensitization.",
                "It increases the production of cortisol to help participants power through the session.",
                "It focuses solely on cognitive restructuring of pain beliefs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation utilizes the social engagement system to transition participants from a sympathetic (fight/flight) or dorsal (shutdown) state into a ventral vagal state, which helps downregulate the overactive nervous system characteristic of fibromyalgia."

            "question": "When mapping the R.E.S.T.O.R.E. framework to an 8-week cohort, which phase is most critical to establish in Weeks 1-2 to ensure group safety?",
            "options": [
                "The 'E' phase (Exercise and Movement) to build physical strength immediately.",
                "The 'T' phase (Toxin Reduction) to clear the environment.",
                "The 'R' phase (Recognizing the Nervous System) to establish a shared language of safety.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'R' (Recognizing the Nervous System) phase is the foundation of the framework and must be established first to create the psychological and physiological safety necessary for group work."

            "options": [
                "90 minutes of lecture, 20 minutes of Q&A, 8 minutes of networking.",
                "90 minutes total duration, 20-minute change of pace, 8-minute sensory rest breaks.",
                "90% participation, 20% theory, 8% assessment.",
                "90 participants max, 20 facilitators, 8 weeks long."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To prevent cognitive fatigue and Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), workshops should be capped at 90 minutes, change the delivery mode every 20 minutes, and include 8-minute 'quiet' or sensory-downregulation breaks."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "What is the facilitator's primary goal when a group begins 'trauma-dumping' or spiraling into collective venting about symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Allowing the vent to continue indefinitely to ensure everyone feels 'heard.'",
                "Immediately muting all participants to regain control of the session.",
                "Validating the emotion while bridging the conversation back to a regulation tool or the 'collective 'we'.'",
                "Providing medical advice to solve the specific symptoms being discussed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Facilitators must distinguish between 'validating' (acknowledging the pain) and 'venting' (which can trigger sympathetic arousal in the whole group). Bridging back to regulation ensures the group remains in a therapeutic window."

                "The color of the walls in the meeting room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fibromyalgia patients often have Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS) and sensory processing sensitivities; fluorescent flickering and fragrances can trigger immediate central nervous system arousal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Panoramic awareness shifts the brain out of 'foveal' (narrow/stress) vision and into a state that signals safety to the brainstem, which is highly effective when done collectively."

            "id": "q34_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While pain intensity may decrease, the most profound impact of group work is the increase in 'Self-Efficacy' (the belief that one can manage their condition) and the reduction of the 'loneliness epidemic' in chronic pain."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "When scaling a program to a multi-day retreat, what is the recommended 'Rest-to-Activity' ratio for FM participants?",
            "options": [
                "4:1 (4 hours of activity for every 1 hour of rest).",
                "1:1 (Equal parts scheduled activity and scheduled horizontal rest).",
                "10:1 (Activity all day, rest only at night).",
                "No specific ratio; participants should push through the fatigue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To avoid the 'Crash and Burn' cycle, retreats must implement a 1:1 ratio, ensuring that for every hour of workshop or movement, there is an hour of scheduled, non-negotiable rest."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Parking Lot' allows the facilitator to acknowledge the participant's contribution while deferring it to a later time or a 1-on-1 setting, maintaining the group's flow without shaming the individual."

                "Scheduling sessions for 3 hours to get everything done at once."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing 'visual load' by allowing cameras to be off and providing audio-only options helps preserve the limited 'spoons' (energy units) of fibromyalgia participants."
