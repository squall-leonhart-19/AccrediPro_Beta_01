            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fibromyalgia is a complex, multi-system condition. A boutique model allows the specialist to dedicate 60-90 minutes per session, which is often required for the thorough assessments and bio-psycho-social support foundational to the RESTORE Framework™."

            "explanation": "Fibromyalgia patients often face medical gaslighting. Bridging the trust gap requires establishing authority and empathy by providing high-quality, evidence-based education that proves the specialist understands the underlying mechanisms of the condition."
