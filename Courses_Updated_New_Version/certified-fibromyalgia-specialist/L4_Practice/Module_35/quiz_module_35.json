                "Shifting focus from clinical delivery to designing the systems that ensure clinical excellence",
                "Becoming the sole point of contact for all patient emergencies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CEO transition requires moving from 'doing' the work to 'designing' the systems. A CEO focuses on scalability and infrastructure rather than personal delivery of every service."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Fibromyalgia patients often suffer from social isolation; a curated cohort provides a community for co-regulation, which is a key component of nervous system stabilization."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Global expansion requires localization. For example, 'rest' may be viewed differently in a high-productivity culture versus a communal culture, requiring adapted coaching strategies."

                "They are required by the IRS for all health businesses",
                "They ensure the business value is in the 'Systems' rather than the 'Founder'"

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A business that relies entirely on the founder's personality (The Mage) is difficult to sell. SOPs turn the business into a 'Machine' that can operate without the founder, increasing its value."
