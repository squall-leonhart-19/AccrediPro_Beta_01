            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "In the context of the neurobiology of central sensitization (L1), what phenomenon describes the progressive increase in firing of dorsal horn neurons in response to repetitive sub-threshold noxious stimuli?",
            "options": [
                "Peripheral sensitization",
                "Temporal summation (Wind-up)",
                "Neuroplastic inhibition",
                "Descending modulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Temporal summation, or 'wind-up,' is a hallmark of central sensitization in Fibromyalgia, where the central nervous system becomes hyper-reactive to repetitive stimuli that would normally be perceived as minor."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Research into the genetics of Fibromyalgia (L2) has frequently identified polymorphisms in the COMT gene. How does a 'low-activity' COMT variant contribute to pain sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the rapid breakdown of serotonin",
                "By reducing the density of Mu-opioid receptors",
                "By resulting in higher levels of pro-nociceptive catecholamines",
                "By inhibiting the production of Substance P"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme breaks down catecholamines (like dopamine and norepinephrine). Low-activity variants lead to higher levels of these neurotransmitters, which is associated with increased pain sensitivity and reduced endogenous opioid efficacy."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to the research on mitochondrial function in FM (L3), what is the primary bioenergetic deficit observed in the muscle tissue of affected patients?",
            "options": [
                "Reduced ATP production and increased oxidative stress",
                "Excessive mitochondrial fission leading to hyper-metabolism",
                "Inability to process glucose via glycolysis",
                "Overproduction of Coenzyme Q10"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that FM patients often exhibit lower levels of ATP and reduced mitochondrial mass in skin and muscle biopsies, coupled with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contributes to muscle pain and fatigue."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "L4 discusses 'Alpha-Delta Sleep Intrusion.' What does this specific sleep architecture finding represent in Fibromyalgia research?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of rapid eye movement during deep sleep",
                "The intrusion of high-frequency alpha waves into slow-wave (delta) sleep",
                "A total absence of Stage 1 sleep",
                "An overabundance of growth hormone secretion during the night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha-delta sleep intrusion is a classic finding in FM research where 'awake-like' alpha waves interrupt the restorative delta waves of deep sleep, leading to non-restorative sleep and morning stiffness."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "When applying Targeted Movement research (L5), what is the most effective strategy for preventing the 'boom-bust' cycle in a client with high kinesiophobia?",

                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) to 'shock' the nervous system",
                "Bed rest until all pain symptoms subside",
                "Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) and pacing based on the 'Energy Envelope'",
                "Standard weightlifting protocols focused on hypertrophy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Graded Motor Imagery and pacing allow for neuroplastic reorganization without triggering the central nervous system's threat response, helping clients stay within their 'energy envelope' and avoid post-exertional malaise."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) research (L6) suggests that FM is characterized by a 'pro-inflammatory' cytokine profile. Which specific cytokine is most consistently elevated in the CSF of FM patients?",

                "Oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-8 and IL-6, have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of FM patients, suggesting neuroinflammation plays a role in pain processing."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "In the study of the Gut-Brain Axis (L7), what percentage of Fibromyalgia patients are estimated to also meet the criteria for Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Between 70% and 100% in some clinical cohorts",
                "Exactly 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research, notably by Pimentel et al., has shown a high correlation (up to 70-100% in some studies) between FM and positive lactulose breath tests for SIBO, highlighting the importance of the gut-microbiome in systemic inflammation."

            "question": "L8 discusses Emerging Therapies. What is the proposed mechanism of action for Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) in treating Fibromyalgia?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a permanent antagonist to all opioid receptors",
                "It stimulates the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands",
                "It modulates glial cell activation and reduces neuroinflammation",
                "It increases the thickness of the myelin sheath"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In low doses, Naltrexone is thought to act as a glial cell inhibitor, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS, thereby lowering the 'volume' of the pain signaling system."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'allodynia.' Based on the research in Module 19, how should a Specialist define this to the client?",
            "options": [
                "Pain that lasts for more than 12 months",
                "Pain resulting from a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain",
                "An increased sensitivity to a stimulus that is already painful",
                "Pain that is purely psychological in origin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allodynia is a clinical feature of central sensitization where non-painful stimuli (like the touch of clothing or a light breeze) are perceived as painful by the sensitized brain."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Research into Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a tool for Energy Pacing (L3) indicates that FM patients generally exhibit:",
            "options": [
                "High HRV, indicating a dominant Parasympathetic nervous system",
                "Low HRV, indicating a dominant Sympathetic nervous system (reduced vagal tone)",
                "Erratic HRV that has no correlation with pain levels",
                "HRV levels identical to healthy sedentary controls"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FM patients typically show low HRV, which reflects a state of autonomic dysregulation characterized by sympathetic dominance and reduced parasympathetic (vagal) tone, making them less resilient to stress."
