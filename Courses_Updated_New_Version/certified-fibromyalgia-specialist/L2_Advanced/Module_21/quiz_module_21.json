            "question": "According to the 'Strategic Energy Pacing' model, what is the primary objective of the '70% Rule'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client completes 70% of their daily chores before resting",
                "To limit daily energy expenditure to 70% of perceived capacity, leaving a 30% reserve for CNS healing",
                "To increase physical activity by 70% every two weeks to build stamina",
                "To ensure 70% of the client's diet consists of anti-inflammatory whole foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 70% Rule is a cornerstone of pacing that prevents the 'Boom-Bust' cycle by ensuring clients always maintain a 30% energy buffer, which prevents neurological exhaustion and supports systemic recovery."

            "question": "In the 'Micro-Progression Model' for movement, what is the recommended 'Symptom Threshold' for pausing or scaling back an activity?",
            "options": [
                "A 5% increase in baseline pain",
                "A 20% or greater increase in symptom intensity lasting more than 2 hours post-activity",
                "Any level of fatigue that requires a nap",
                "Only when the client reaches a pain level of 8/10 on the VAS scale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines for Graded Movement suggest that a 20% increase in symptoms that persists for more than 2 hours indicates the 'Micro-Progression' was too aggressive and needs adjustment."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Which sleep architecture phenomenon is most commonly associated with 'non-restorative sleep' in Fibromyalgia patients?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Alpha-Delta Sleep Interruption is a hallmark of Fibromyalgia sleep pathology, where the brain stays in a state of 'vigilance' (alpha waves) during what should be deep, restorative (delta) sleep."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Root Assessment Logic goes beyond symptom tracking to analyze the relationship between the client's total physiological/emotional load and their current CNS capacity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When prodromal signs (early warning symptoms) are identified, the protocol dictates an immediate shift to down-regulation and a reduced-demand 'Maintenance Calendar' to prevent a full-scale flare."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic pacing requires that high-cognitive tasks (which drain the CNS) are buffered by reset breaks and placed within the 'Optimal Performance Window' identified during intake."

            "id": "q21_9",

                "Telling the client their fear is irrational",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion (an ACT-based technique) helps clients view their fear-based thoughts as 'mental events' rather than absolute truths, allowing them to engage in Micro-Progression movement safely."
