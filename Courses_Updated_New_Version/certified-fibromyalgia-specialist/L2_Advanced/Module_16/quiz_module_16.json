            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Beers Criteria is a list of medications that should be avoided or used with caution in seniors; many common FM drugs (like certain TCAs) can cause dangerous side effects in the aging population."
