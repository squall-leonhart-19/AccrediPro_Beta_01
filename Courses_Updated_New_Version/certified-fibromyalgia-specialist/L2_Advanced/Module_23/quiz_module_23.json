            "question": "In Advanced Sensory Integration (L1), what is the primary physiological goal of utilizing 'graded desensitization' for a fibromyalgia client with severe allodynia?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the speed of peripheral nerve conduction",

                "To bypass the thalamus and send signals directly to the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Graded desensitization aims to provide consistent, non-threatening sensory input to help the central nervous system 'unlearn' its hyper-reactive response to touch."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "According to the Biofeedback protocols (L2), which metric is considered the 'gold standard' for assessing a client's ability to enter a state of physiological coherence?",
            "options": [
                "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) latency",
                "Electromyography (EMG) of the trapezius muscle",

                "Beta-wave dominance in the temporal lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RSA amplitude reflects the synchronization of heart rate and breath, serving as a primary indicator of autonomic nervous system flexibility and coherence."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In HRV-Guided Pacing (L3), if a client's morning RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) is 25% below their 7-day rolling average, what is the recommended 'Advanced Pacing' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Increase aerobic intensity to 'flush out' metabolic waste",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in RMSSD indicates low parasympathetic tone and high physiological stress; the protocol mandates reducing load to prevent a full-scale flare."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "What is the underlying mechanism of 'Fascial Counterstrain' (L4) in treating fibromyalgia-related myofascial pain?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fascial Counterstrain works by moving the body into a position of ease (shortening), which reduces the neural drive to the dysfunctional tissue and resets the neuromuscular reflex arc."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) for Pain Resilience (L5) differs from traditional CBT because it specifically emphasizes:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CFT is movement-based; it uses behavioral experiments to show clients they can move safely, thereby reducing the 'threat' value the brain assigns to movement."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "When applying Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) concepts (L6), which anatomical area is most commonly targeted for non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation (tVNS)?",

                "The bridge of the nose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The auricular branch of the vagus nerve is most accessible at the cymba conchae and tragus, making these the primary targets for tVNS devices."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammaging is a state of chronic, sterile, low-grade inflammation that is a significant biological trigger for central sensitization in fibromyalgia."

        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "During 'Recovery Architecting' (L8), what is the '48-hour rule' regarding Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)?",
            "options": [
                "Clients must sleep for 48 hours straight after any exercise",
                "Activity should only be increased if the client experiences no symptom increase for 48 hours post-exertion",
                "Flares always last exactly 48 hours regardless of the intervention",
                "The client must wait 48 hours before taking any rescue medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 48-hour rule ensures that the client is not in a 'delayed PEM' cycle, which is common in fibromyalgia and ME/CFS, before adding more physical or cognitive load."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'brain fog' and high levels of sympathetic dominance. Which biofeedback frequency range would be most appropriate to target for 'Alpha-Theta' training?",
            "options": [
                "1-3 Hz (Delta)",
                "15-30 Hz (High Beta)",

                "40+ Hz (Gamma)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha-Theta training (5-12 Hz) facilitates a deeply relaxed, meditative state that helps bridge the conscious and subconscious, reducing sympathetic over-arousal."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "Which 'Environmental Trigger' (L7) is most likely to cause a 'rebound flare' if not addressed during the stabilization phase of treatment?",
