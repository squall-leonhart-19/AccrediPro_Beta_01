            "question": "In the RESTORE Framework™, what defines the 'Synergistic Application' phase compared to the initial implementation phase?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on the single most severe symptom until it is resolved",
                "Addressing the bidirectional relationships between pillars, such as how Sleep (S) quality directly impacts Exercise (T) tolerance",
                "Increasing the dosage of supplements to overcome plateaus",
                "Removing environmental triggers before addressing internal physiological markers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synergistic application moves beyond treating pillars in isolation and focuses on the 'inter-pillar' dynamics, recognizing that improvements in one area (like sleep) create the physiological capacity for progress in another (like movement)."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Phenotype A' (Central Sensitization Predominant). Which clinical reasoning approach is most appropriate for personalizing their plan?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training to 'reset' the nervous system",
                "Aggressive detoxification protocols to remove heavy metals",
                "Prioritizing 'R' (Resilience) and 'S' (Sleep) to down-regulate the HPA axis before increasing 'T' (Movement)",
                "Focusing primarily on 'O' (Oxidative Stress) through high-dose antioxidant therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Central Sensitization phenotypes require nervous system stabilization. Prioritizing Resilience and Sleep helps lower the 'threat' perception of the brain, making later movement interventions more successful."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "In the Energy-Movement Continuum (E & T), what is the primary indicator that a client has exceeded their 'Mitochondrial Envelope'?",
            "options": [
                "Muscle soreness immediately following the exercise session",
                "A slight increase in heart rate during the activity",
                "Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) that occurs 12-48 hours after activity",
                "Increased sweating during low-level movement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PEM is the hallmark of exceeding the energy envelope in Fibromyalgia and CFS, often involving a delayed 'crash' in energy and spike in pain 12 to 48 hours post-exertion."

            "id": "q18_4",

            "options": [
                "The activation of the glymphatic system during Stage 3 (N3) Deep Sleep",
                "The consumption of polyphenols during the morning hours",
                "Increasing Vitamin C intake before bedtime",
                "Maintaining a core body temperature above 99 degrees Fahrenheit during sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Deep sleep (N3) is when the glymphatic system is most active, clearing metabolic waste and oxidative byproducts from the brain, which is essential for reducing the 'brain fog' associated with neuroinflammation."

        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "When synthesizing Resilience (R) and Environment (E), the concept of 'Psychological Flexibility' refers to:",

                "The ability to ignore pain and continue with daily tasks regardless of severity",
                "Staying committed to values-based actions even in the presence of difficult symptoms or environmental triggers",
                "Changing one's environment every time a flare occurs to avoid triggers",
                "Practicing meditation for at least two hours daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychological flexibility, a core component of ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), involves maintaining behavior consistent with one's values even when experiencing pain or environmental challenges."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Troubleshooting the Non-Linear Recovery Path, what is the 'Rule of 50%' during a symptom flare?",
            "options": [
                "Increase medication dosage by 50% immediately",
                "Reduce the planned 'T' (Movement) and 'E' (Environmental) demands by 50% to allow for nervous system recovery",
                "Assume that only 50% of the progress made was 'real'",
                "Spend 50% of the day in total darkness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 50%' is a pacing strategy used during flares to prevent the 'boom-bust' cycle, suggesting a temporary reduction in activity to prevent further sensitization of the nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "In complex case management, if a client experiences both severe Gastroparesis (Nutrition/O) and severe Insomnia (Sleep), why is Sleep usually prioritized first?",
            "options": [
                "Because sleep is easier to fix than digestion",
                "Because sleep deprivation exacerbates visceral hypersensitivity and impairs the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)",
                "Because nutrition has no impact on fibromyalgia symptoms",
                "Because clients are usually more compliant with sleep hygiene than dietary changes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep is a foundational regulator of the autonomic nervous system. Poor sleep keeps the body in a sympathetic state, which inhibits digestion (the 'rest and digest' parasympathetic function)."

        {
            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "The Master Roadmap emphasizes that 'Sustaining Long-Term Outcomes' requires a shift from 'Specialist-Led' care to:",
            "options": [
                "Primary Care-led care",
                "Client-led self-efficacy and internal locus of control",
                "Permanent reliance on high-dose supplementation",
                "Daily monitoring by a health coach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term success in fibromyalgia management is highly correlated with the client's development of self-efficacy—the belief and ability to manage their own symptoms and triggers independently."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis referenced in the module suggests that integrated multi-modal programs (like RESTORE) show what improvement in 'Quality of Life' scores compared to single-intervention protocols?",
            "options": [
                "No significant difference",
                "Approximately 10-15% improvement",
                "Approximately 35-50% greater improvement",
                "Integrated programs were actually less effective due to 'overwhelming' the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data indicates that addressing the neuro-immune-endocrine system through integrated, multi-pillar approaches yields significantly higher effect sizes (35-50% better) than addressing pain or sleep in isolation."

        {
            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Red Flag' during the Troubleshooting phase that requires immediate medical referral rather than coaching adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "A standard flare lasting 3 days after a stressful event",
                "New-onset focal neurological deficits, such as sudden limb weakness or loss of bowel control",
                "Increased muscle stiffness upon waking",
                "Temporary increase in brain fog during a weather change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While flares and stiffness are common in fibromyalgia, focal neurological deficits are 'Red Flags' that may indicate serious underlying conditions (like myelopathy or stroke) and require urgent medical evaluation."
