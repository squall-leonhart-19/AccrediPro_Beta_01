            "question": "A client has been following their protocol for 12 weeks with zero improvement in pain scores. According to Lesson 1 on 'The Non-Responder,' what is the first clinical step in troubleshooting?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the intensity of the exercise intervention",
                "Screen for 'Hidden Drivers' such as occult infections, mold toxicity, or undiagnosed sleep apnea",
                "Assume the client is non-compliant and terminate the coaching relationship",
                "Switch to a strictly carnivore diet to eliminate all potential plant lectins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is 'stuck' or a non-responder, specialists must look for physiological barriers (Hidden Drivers) like sleep apnea, CIRS, or persistent infections that keep the nervous system in a state of high alarm."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In clients with comorbid Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Fibromyalgia, how can a specialist distinguish an RA flare from a Fibromyalgia flare?",
            "options": [
                "Fibromyalgia flares always involve elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels",
                "RA flares typically involve localized joint swelling, heat, and morning stiffness lasting longer than 60 minutes",
                "Fibromyalgia flares are only felt in the muscles, while RA is only in the skin",
                "There is no clinical way to distinguish the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RA is an inflammatory autoimmune condition characterized by synovitis (joint swelling/warmth) and prolonged morning stiffness, whereas Fibromyalgia is a condition of central sensitization usually without localized joint inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Why does the menopausal transition often lead to a significant increase in Fibromyalgia symptom severity?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen is neuroprotective and modulates serotonin; its decline lowers the pain threshold",
                "Progesterone increase causes muscle tissue to break down more rapidly",
                "Menopause causes the brain to shrink, leading to permanent nerve damage",
                "Hot flashes cause physical burns on the nerve endings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a vital role in modulating neurotransmitters like serotonin and endorphins. The drop in 17β-estradiol during menopause reduces the body's natural descending pain inhibition."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "When coaching 'High-Performance Professionals' (Lesson 4), what is the most effective way to frame 'Pacing' to ensure compliance?",
            "options": [
                "Tell them they are 'lazy' if they don't rest",
                "Frame pacing as 'Strategic Recovery' or 'Energy Management' required for peak cognitive performance",
                "Suggest they quit their job immediately to focus on health",
                "Encourage them to 'push through' the pain to build mental toughness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-achievers often have identity-based resistance to 'resting.' Reframing pacing as a high-performance strategy for efficiency helps them adopt the behavior without feeling like they are failing."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Coaching (Lesson 5), what does the 'Window of Tolerance' represent?",
            "options": [
                "The amount of time a client can spend in the sun before a flare",
                "The physiological zone where the client can process information and self-regulate without flipping into hyperarousal or hypoarousal",
                "The maximum number of supplements a client can take at once",
                "The specific number of minutes a client can exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is a concept in trauma recovery where the nervous system is regulated enough to process emotions and coaching without becoming overwhelmed (fight/flight) or shutting down (freeze)."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "According to the Beers Criteria discussed in Lesson 6, why is Amitriptyline (a common Fibro medication) often inappropriate for the aging population?",
            "options": [
                "It causes excessive weight loss in the elderly",
                "It has high anticholinergic burden, increasing the risk of falls, confusion, and urinary retention",
                "It is too expensive for most seniors on Medicare",
                "It makes the skin too sensitive to touch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant with strong anticholinergic effects, which the Beers Criteria identifies as potentially inappropriate for older adults due to significant risks of cognitive impairment and falls."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client with comorbid ME/CFS experiences a 'crash' 24 hours after a 15-minute walk. This phenomenon is known as:",
            "options": [
                "Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PEM is the hallmark of ME/CFS. It is a worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion that typically appears 12–48 hours after the activity and can last for days or weeks."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "What is the '50% Rule' when managing activity for a client with severe ME/CFS co-occurrence?",
            "options": [
                "Only eat 50% of your daily calories",
                "Only perform 50% of what you *feel* you are capable of doing on any given day",

                "Only take 50% of the prescribed medication dose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 50% rule is a pacing strategy that prevents the 'Boom-Bust' cycle by ensuring the client always keeps a significant energy reserve, preventing the triggering of PEM."

            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Pre-emptive Pacing' for major life transitions. If a client is moving house in one month, what should their activity level look like two weeks prior?",
            "options": [
                "Increase activity to 'train' for the move",
                "Maintain normal activity levels until the day of the move",
                "Reduce baseline activity by 30-50% to build an 'Energy Buffer'",
                "Stop all movement and stay in bed for two weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pre-emptive pacing involves intentionally reducing activity levels before a known high-stress event to accumulate energy and minimize the severity of the inevitable post-event flare."

            "question": "A client with Sjogren's Syndrome and Fibromyalgia complains of 'burning' in their feet and extreme dryness. Which comorbid condition should the specialist suspect?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Small Fiber Neuropathy (SFN) is highly prevalent in both Fibromyalgia and Sjogren’s Syndrome. It manifests as burning, tingling, or 'electric' pain, often starting in the extremities."
