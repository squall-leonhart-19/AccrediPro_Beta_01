            "question": "According to the 2016 ACR Diagnostic Criteria, what is the specific requirement for the 'Generalized Pain Index' to confirm a Fibromyalgia diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "Pain must be present in at least 3 out of 5 body regions.",
                "Pain must be present in at least 4 out of 5 body regions.",
                "Pain must be present in all 5 body regions.",
                "Pain must be bilateral (both left and right sides) in all quadrants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2016 revision requires 'generalized pain,' defined as pain in at least 4 of 5 regions (Left Upper, Right Upper, Left Lower, Right Lower, or Axial) to distinguish FM from localized regional pain syndromes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The gold standard diagnostic threshold is a WPI of 7+ with an SSS of 5+, or a lower WPI (4-6) if the symptom severity is higher (SSS 9+)."

            "id": "q20_5",

            "options": [
                "The client is below the clinical threshold for central sensitization.",
                "The client has 'subclinical' sensitization requiring no intervention.",
                "The client has met the validated cutoff (40) for Central Sensitization Syndrome.",
                "The score is invalid as the CSI is only used for surgical candidates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A score of 40 on the CSI is the established clinical cutoff; scores above this indicate a high likelihood that central sensitization is the primary driver of the patient's symptoms."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "What does the 'Alpha-Delta' sleep pattern, often seen in Fibromyalgia sleep architecture diagnostics, represent?",
            "options": [
                "A state of deep, restorative REM sleep.",
                "The intrusion of wake-like alpha waves into deep stage N3 (delta) sleep.",
                "Rapid transition from wakefulness directly into REM sleep.",
                "A total absence of alpha waves during the day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha-delta sleep is a hallmark of FM where the brain's 'wake' rhythms (alpha) interrupt 'deep sleep' rhythms (delta), leading to non-restorative sleep and morning stiffness."

            "id": "q20_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 6MWT is a validated measure for FM that assesses submaximal aerobic capacity and how the condition impacts the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Which psychosocial metric is specifically designed to measure a client's tendency to magnify the threat value of pain and feel helpless in the context of pain?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) measures rumination, magnification, and helplessness, which are key psychosocial drivers of central sensitization."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "In longitudinal flare analysis, what is the primary purpose of identifying 'Herald Symptoms'?",
            "options": [
                "To prove the client is exaggerating their symptoms.",
                "To identify prodromal signs that allow for early intervention before a full flare occurs.",
                "To determine the exact day the client will be fully recovered.",
                "To replace the need for WPI and SSS scoring."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Herald symptoms are early warning signs (like increased thirst or specific tingling) that precede a flare. Identifying them allows the client to implement 'rescue' protocols to dampen the flare's severity."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client presents with significant 'FibroFog' and cognitive dysfunction. Which assessment tool is most appropriate for specifically quantifying cognitive impact in this population?",
            "options": [
                "The FIQR (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire)",
                "The MACE (Multidimensional Assessment of Cognitive Effort)",
