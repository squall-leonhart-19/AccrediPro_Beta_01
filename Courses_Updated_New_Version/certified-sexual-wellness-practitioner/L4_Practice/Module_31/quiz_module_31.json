                "It allows the practitioner to charge premium rates by becoming a recognized specialist in a high-need area.",

                "Only using static images without any text or captions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Algospeak and focusing on the 'transformational' or 'emotional' aspects of wellness helps bypass automated filters that flag explicit keywords while still reaching the target audience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
