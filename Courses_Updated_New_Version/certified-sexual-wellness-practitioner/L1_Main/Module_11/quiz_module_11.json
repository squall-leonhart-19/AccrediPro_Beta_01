            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Awareness focuses on embodiment and interoception—the ability to perceive internal physical sensations—which is foundational for sexual pleasure and regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model, developed by Bancroft and Janssen, posits that the brain has an accelerator (SES) and a brake (SIS) that determine sexual response."

                "It integrates biological health, psychological state, and social/cultural influences",
                "It prioritizes spiritual beliefs over physical symptoms",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For many, particularly those with high SIS sensitivity, arousal is 'context-dependent.' Removing 'brakes' (stress, lack of privacy) is often more effective than pushing the 'accelerator.'"
