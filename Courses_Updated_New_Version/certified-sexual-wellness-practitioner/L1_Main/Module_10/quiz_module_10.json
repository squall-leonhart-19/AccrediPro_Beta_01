                "A linear, medicalized approach to treating sexual dysfunction",
                "A holistic, non-linear system that integrates biological, psychological, and relational elements",
                "A strictly behavioral protocol focused on increasing frequency of intercourse",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "A standard physical examination",

                "A sexual frequency log"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Bio-Psycho-Social Intake is the gold standard in the Discovery phase, as it allows practitioners to see the intersection of physical health, mental state, and social/relational environment."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model discussed in the 'Education (E)' lesson, sexual inhibition (the 'Brakes') is primarily triggered by:",
            "options": [
                "A lack of testosterone in the bloodstream",
                "The presence of perceived threats, stressors, or distractions in the environment",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model posits that the Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) or 'Brakes' responds to potential threats or distractions, which must be lowered for the 'Accelerators' to function."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive tracking is a somatic technique used to bridge the mind-body gap by helping clients become aware of internal sensations, which is foundational for sexual pleasure."

            "options": [
                "That desire must always precede physical arousal",
                "That desire often emerges *after* physical stimulation and arousal have begun",
                "That they likely have a permanent hormonal deficiency",
                "That they should wait until they feel a 'spark' before engaging in intimacy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding responsive desire—where arousal leads to desire—is critical for clients who feel 'broken' because they do not experience spontaneous sexual urges."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state represents safety; without this sense of safety, the body's 'brakes' (inhibition) are likely to remain engaged, preventing arousal."

            "options": [
                "Because the practitioner likely forgot the initial intake details",
                "To bill the client for additional assessment hours",
                "Because new barriers often emerge as layers of somatic and emotional blocks are removed",
                "To prove to the client that they haven't made any progress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The framework is iterative; as clients progress through somatic or emotional work, deeper 'discovery' items often surface that were not accessible during the initial intake."
