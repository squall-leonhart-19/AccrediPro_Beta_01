            "question": "According to modern MRI studies (e.g., Odile Buisson), the internal 'crura' of the clitoral complex can extend up to how many centimeters in length?",
            "options": [
                "2-3 cm",
                "5-9 cm",
                "12-15 cm",
                "18-20 cm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced imaging has revealed the clitoral complex is much larger than the external glans, with the crura (legs) typically measuring between 5 and 9 cm in length."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the Dual Control Model developed by Bancroft and Janssen, a 'Sensitive Accelerator' (High SES) paired with a 'Sensitive Brake' (High SIS) often results in which clinical presentation?",
            "options": [
                "A complete lack of sexual interest or arousal",
                "High sexual excitability that is easily inhibited by stress or distraction",
                "Compulsive sexual behavior regardless of environmental context",
                "Low sexual excitability but a total lack of inhibitory response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with high Sexual Excitation (SES) and high Sexual Inhibition (SIS) can be easily 'turned on' but are equally prone to being 'turned off' by minor stressors or self-consciousness."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "During the physiological process of tumescence, what is the specific role of Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP)?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the contraction of the tunica albuginea",
                "It stimulates the release of norepinephrine to end the erection",
                "It signals the smooth muscles of the corpora cavernosa to relax, allowing blood inflow",
                "It binds to testosterone to increase peripheral sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nitric oxide triggers the production of cGMP, which acts as a secondary messenger to relax smooth muscles, allowing the penile or clitoral tissues to engorge with blood."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Rosemary Basson’s Circular Model of Sexual Response was specifically designed to address which limitation of the Masters and Johnson Linear Model?",
            "options": [
                "The exclusion of male physiological refractory periods",
                "The assumption that sexual response always begins with spontaneous hunger/desire",
                "The failure to account for the role of the prostate in arousal",
                "The over-emphasis on the resolution phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Basson's model accounts for 'responsive desire,' where a person may start in a state of sexual neutrality and develop desire only after physical stimulation or emotional intimacy has begun."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client taking a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) reports 'genital anesthesia.' What is the primary neurobiological mechanism behind this side effect?",
            "options": [
                "Increased serotonin (5-HT) in the synapse inhibits dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway",
                "SSRIs cause a permanent drop in total serum testosterone",
                "Serotonin causes the immediate breakdown of Nitric Oxide",
                "The medication causes physical scarring of the dorsal nerve"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High levels of serotonin generally have an inhibitory effect on sexual arousal because serotonin acts as a 'brake' on the dopamine-driven reward and desire systems of the brain."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In the PLISSIT model of sexual counseling, which level of intervention involves providing the client with a specific exercise like 'Sensate Focus'?",
            "options": [
                "Permission (P)",
                "Limited Information (LI)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific Suggestions (SS) involve providing concrete exercises or techniques (like Sensate Focus or pelvic floor relaxation) to address a specific sexual concern."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which hormone, when elevated due to chronic stress (high cortisol), directly increases Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), thereby lowering 'Free' Testosterone?",
            "options": [
                "Oxytocin",
                "Estrogen",
                "Progesterone",
                "Luteinizing Hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated estrogen or certain metabolic shifts can increase SHBG levels; SHBG binds to testosterone, making it unavailable for use by the body's tissues, which can lower libido even if 'Total' testosterone appears normal."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "The 'Small Vessel Hypothesis' suggests that Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is often an early 'canary in the coal mine' for cardiovascular disease because:",
            "options": [
                "The penile arteries (1-2mm) are smaller than coronary arteries (3-4mm) and show obstruction sooner",
                "The penis requires more blood than the heart to function",
                "Erectile tissue is the only tissue in the body with alpha-receptors",
                "Testosterone is only produced when the heart rate exceeds 100 bpm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Because the arteries supplying the penis are significantly smaller than the coronary arteries, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis often manifest as ED years before a cardiac event occurs."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which neurochemical is often referred to as the 'satiety' hormone, released in high amounts after orgasm, leading to the refractory period in males?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine",
                "Prolactin",
                "Vasopressin",
                "Epinephrine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolactin is released following orgasm and is associated with sexual satisfaction and the temporary suppression of libido (the refractory period), particularly in men."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Modern anatomical research into the 'G-Spot' suggests it is most accurately described as:",
            "options": [
                "A distinct, bean-shaped gland located on the anterior vaginal wall",
                "A vestigial organ with no known physiological function",
                "The 'Clitourethrovaginal (CUV) Complex,' where the internal clitoral structures, urethra, and vaginal wall intersect",
                "A bundle of nerves originating directly from the cervix"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current consensus (e.g., Jannini et al.) suggests the G-spot is not a single anatomical 'spot' but a functional zone where the internal clitoral bulbs, the urethra, and the vaginal wall interact during stimulation."
