                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sexual agency is an internal, proactive state where an individual recognizes their own desires and feels empowered to act on them, whereas consent is frequently a reactive response to another person's initiation."

            ],
