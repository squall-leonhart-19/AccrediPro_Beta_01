            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "Which specific area of the brain is primarily responsible for 'interoception'—the ability to perceive and integrate internal bodily sensations such as heart rate and sexual arousal?",
            "options": [
                "The Insular Cortex",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex (specifically the posterior and mid-insula) is the primary hub for interoception, mapping visceral sensations and translating them into conscious feelings."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "When utilizing the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA-2) in clinical practice, what does a low score in the 'Not-Distracting' scale typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client has excellent focus during sexual activity.",
                "The client tends to use physical sensations to ignore emotional pain.",
                "The client has a tendency to ignore or distract themselves from sensations of pain or discomfort.",
                "The client is hyper-aware of every minor bodily change."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Not-Distracting' scale measures the tendency NOT to ignore or distract oneself from sensations of pain or discomfort; a low score suggests the client frequently uses distraction as a coping mechanism for bodily signals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "According to research on 'Arousal Non-Concordance,' what percentage of women typically experience a 'disconnection' where physical genital response does not match their subjective feeling of being 'turned on'?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses (Chivers et al.) show that the correlation between physical and subjective arousal is lower in women (around 50%) than in men, making non-concordance a normal physiological variation rather than a dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "A client feels 'broken' because they experience physical lubrication during an unwanted or neutral encounter. Which intervention is most appropriate for dismantling this internalized script?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting the client use more lubrication to increase sensation.",
                "Explaining the 'System 1' vs 'System 2' response and the concept of arousal non-concordance.",
                "Recommending the client practice Kegel exercises to gain control.",
                "Advising the client to avoid all sexual contact until the physical response stops."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychoeducation on arousal non-concordance helps the client understand that the body's 'System 1' (automatic) response is separate from their 'System 2' (subjective/consensual) desire."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "In Somatic Resourcing, the '5-4-3-2-1' technique is used to help a client ground themselves. This is particularly effective for moving a client out of which state?",
            "options": [
                "Hypo-arousal (Numbness/Dissociation)",
                "Hyper-arousal (Panic/Flashbacks)",
                "The Flow State",
                "The Refractory Period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques like 5-4-3-2-1 utilize external sensory input to anchor a client in the present moment, effectively de-escalating the sympathetic nervous system during hyper-arousal."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of 'Cognitive Reframing' when moving a client from a performance-based mindset to a pleasure-based mindset?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client can achieve orgasm every time.",
                "To increase the duration of the sexual encounter.",
                "To shift the metric of 'success' from a specific physical outcome to the quality of sensory connection.",
                "To help the client memorize more complex sexual positions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reframing shifts the focus from 'spectatoring' (monitoring performance) to 'embodiment' (experiencing pleasure), removing the goal-oriented pressure that often inhibits the sexual response cycle."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "In Relational Somatics, 'Physiological Co-regulation' refers to:",

                "One partner controlling the other partner's emotions.",
                "The process where two nervous systems influence each other to maintain a state of safety and connection.",
                "Partners having the exact same heart rate at all times.",
                "The use of medication to balance hormones in both partners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation is a bidirectional process where partners use touch, eye contact, and presence to help stabilize each other's nervous systems into a 'ventral vagal' state of safety."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Which component of the D.E.S.I.R.E. Framework involves identifying the specific 'Internalized Scripts' that block a client's somatic presence?",
            "options": [
                "D - Discovery of Sensations",
                "E - Emotional Mapping",

                "R - Reframing the Experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'I' (Inquiry into Narratives) stage focuses on excavating the 'shoulds,' 'musts,' and cultural scripts that the client has internalized, which often conflict with their felt somatic experience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'spectatoring'—constantly worrying about how their body looks during intimacy. Which somatic intervention would be most effective?",
            "options": [
                "Mirrored Sensate Focus (practicing touch in front of a mirror).",
                "Eyes-closed interoceptive tracking to minimize external visual monitoring.",
                "Increasing the intensity of the physical stimulation.",
                "Encouraging the client to work out more to gain body confidence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Closing the eyes removes the 'external' visual data that fuels spectatoring, allowing the client to shift their focus inward to the 'internal' interoceptive sensations of pleasure."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "According to the module, what is the 'Interoceptive Trap' in clients with high anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "They cannot feel anything in their body at all.",
                "They misinterpret neutral or sexual arousal signals (like increased heart rate) as signs of an impending panic attack.",
                "They are too focused on their partner's sensations.",
                "They have a physical blockage in the spinal cord."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Interoceptive Trap' occurs when a client is hyper-vigilant toward bodily sensations but lacks the accuracy to distinguish between 'anxiety' and 'excitement,' leading to a cycle of escalating distress."
