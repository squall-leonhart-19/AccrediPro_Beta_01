            "question": "In the D.E.S.I.R.E. Framework™, which pillar is considered the 'Foundational Container' that must be established before deep Shadow Work (Lesson 6) can safely occur?",
            "options": [
                "Discovery (D)",
                "Safety (S)",
                "Rewiring (R)",
                "Intimacy (I)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety (S) is the foundational container. Without a regulated nervous system and a sense of internal and external safety, engaging with 'Shadow' elements or deep shame can lead to retraumatization rather than integration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners look for the 'Primary Somatic Block'—the specific point where the client's physical or emotional system 'constricts'—as the pivot point to move from assessment into targeted roadmap design."

            "id": "q29_3",

            "options": [
                "To ignore physical sensations in favor of logic",
                "To increase the intensity of physical pleasure only",
                "To translate felt bodily sensations into cognitive meaning and relational communication",
                "To bypass the brain and focus entirely on the skin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic-Cognitive Bridging aims to help the client recognize a sensation (Interoception), name it (Cognition), and express it (Communication), creating a bridge between the 'S' and 'I' pillars."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interlocking triggers occur in the DESIRE Matrix when the defensive strategies of one partner perfectly stimulate the insecurities of the other, creating a feedback loop of relational distress."

            "options": [
                "Physical arousal always indicates psychological desire",
                "A lack of physical response always means the client is not interested",
                "Genital response and subjective mental arousal can be disconnected, especially in women (estimated at 50-90% non-concordance in some studies)",
                "Non-concordance is a sign of a medical pathology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arousal non-concordance is a normal physiological phenomenon where the body responds to stimuli that the mind does not find subjectively desirable, or vice versa. Understanding this is vital for reducing client shame."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Shadow' refers to the positive attributes (like agency, radiance, or leadership) that a client has 'shuttered' away because they were taught these traits were 'too much' or 'dangerous' in a sexual or social context."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable agency is marked by the client's ability to maintain their wellness and advocate for their needs independently of the practitioner’s immediate guidance."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 (Master Practitioner’s Ethos), what is 'Radical Presence'?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to talk for the entire session",
                "Maintaining a regulated, non-judgmental, and attuned state even when the client presents with high-intensity trauma or taboo topics",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radical Presence is the practitioner's ability to remain a 'calm harbor' for the client, ensuring their own countertransference does not interfere with the client's integration process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Numbness is a somatic issue. While the client has the 'cognitive' piece (Rewiring), they lack the 'somatic' piece (Embodiment). Integration requires bridging these two through embodiment practices."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "What is the ultimate goal of the 'Master Integration' module?",
            "options": [
                "To teach the practitioner how to prescribe medication",
