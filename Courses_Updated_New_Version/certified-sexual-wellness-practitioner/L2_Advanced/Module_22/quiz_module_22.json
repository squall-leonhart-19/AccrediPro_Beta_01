            "question": "A Sexual Wellness Practitioner (SWP) is working with a client who begins to disclose deep-seated childhood trauma that is causing significant psychological distress. What is the most ethical course of action according to the 'Scope of Practice' guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the session but focus only on the physical sensations of the trauma.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed mental health professional while clarifying that the SWP scope focuses on education and optimization, not trauma processing.",
                "Incorporate trauma-informed therapy techniques learned in a weekend workshop to help the client.",
                "Tell the client to stop talking about the past and focus only on their future sexual goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must distinguish between wellness/optimization and clinical therapy. Deep-seated trauma processing requires a licensed therapist; the SWP should refer out to ensure client safety."

                "Consent is implied as long as the client continues to pay for the sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced informed consent views consent as a dynamic, ongoing process rather than a static event, allowing the client to adjust their boundaries in real-time."
