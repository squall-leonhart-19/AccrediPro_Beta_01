            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An interoceptive anchor is a somatic resource used in trauma-informed work to help clients regulate their nervous system by focusing on a safe or neutral sensation when they begin to feel flooded or dissociated."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) activation means the 'brakes' of the sexual response are very sensitive, causing arousal to drop quickly in response to stress, distractions, or self-consciousness."
