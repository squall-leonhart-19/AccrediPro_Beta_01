            "question": "Which paradigm shift best describes the transition from 'Clinical Sexology' to 'Sexual Wellness' as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "A shift from focus on reproduction to focus on hormonal balance",
                "A shift from diagnosing pathology and dysfunction to fostering pleasure and somatic flourishing",
                "A shift from behavioral therapy to strictly pharmaceutical interventions",
                "A shift from individual counseling to exclusively group-based relational therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern sexual wellness focuses on the 'Wellness Model,' which prioritizes the enhancement of pleasure, agency, and somatic awareness rather than just the absence of disease (Pathology Model)."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In evidence-based methodology, if a study on a new arousal technique shows a p-value of 0.02 and a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.85), how should a practitioner interpret these results?",
            "options": [
                "The results are statistically significant and represent a high practical impact for clients",
                "The results are statistically significant but have negligible real-world application",
                "The study is invalid because the p-value must be below 0.01 for sexual research",
                "The effect size is too large, suggesting a high probability of researcher bias"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A p-value < 0.05 indicates statistical significance, while a Cohen's d of 0.8 or higher is considered a 'large' effect size, meaning the intervention has a substantial practical impact."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen), what occurs when a client has a high Sexual Inhibitory System (SIS) sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "They experience spontaneous arousal regardless of the environment",
                "Their brain is more likely to prioritize potential threats or distractions over erotic cues",
                "They lack the dopamine receptors necessary to feel pleasure",
                "They are unable to experience the resolution phase of the sexual response cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SIS acts as a 'brake.' High sensitivity means the brain is highly attuned to 'turn-off' signals (stress, fear, self-consciousness), which can suppress arousal even in the presence of 'turn-on' signals (SES)."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Interoception' as a foundation for sexual wellness. Which brain structure is the primary hub for processing these internal bodily signals?",

                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",

                "The Insular Cortex (Insula)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex is responsible for mapping internal physical states (heart rate, breath, pelvic sensations) to the conscious mind, which is critical for somatic sexual awareness."

            "id": "q19_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sexual scripts operate at the cultural level (societal norms), interpersonal level (interaction with partners), and intrapsychic level (individual fantasies and internal dialogue)."

            "id": "q19_6",

                "When a client is unable to reach orgasm despite high levels of intimacy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (notably by Emily Nagoski and others) shows that physical arousal (blood flow) and subjective arousal (feeling 'turned on') do not always align, especially in women."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The IIEF is the gold-standard validated tool for assessing male sexual function, whereas the FSFI is used for female sexual function."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Based on the neurobiology of desire (Lesson 3), which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for 'Incentive Salience' (the 'wanting' or 'seeking' phase)?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Dopamine",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dopamine drives the pursuit of rewards (desire/seeking), while other chemicals like oxytocin and opioids are more involved in the 'liking' or satisfaction phase."

            "id": "q19_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spectatoring is a form of cognitive distraction where the individual's attention shifts from erotic sensations to self-judgment or performance monitoring, often inhibiting arousal."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Virtual Reality (VR) and Biofeedback are emerging tools used to help clients bridge the gap between their physical responses and cognitive awareness (addressing non-concordance)."
