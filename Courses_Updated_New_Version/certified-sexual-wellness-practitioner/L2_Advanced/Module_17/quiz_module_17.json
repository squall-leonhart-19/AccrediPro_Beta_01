            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many neurodivergent individuals experience sensory over-responsivity, where certain textures or light touches (common in foreplay) can be perceived as overstimulating or physically painful."

                "It focuses exclusively on the resolution phase",
                "It accounts for emotional intimacy and neutral starting points as valid precursors to arousal",
                "It assumes that orgasm is the only successful outcome of a sexual encounter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Basson's model acknowledges that for those with chronic illness or disability, desire often follows arousal (responsive desire) and can be motivated by a search for intimacy rather than just physical urge."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
