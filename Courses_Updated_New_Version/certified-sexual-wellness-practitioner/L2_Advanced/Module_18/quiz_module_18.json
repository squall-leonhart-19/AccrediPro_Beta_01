            "question": "During an advanced intake (L1), a practitioner observes a client describing a traumatic event with a flat affect and a smiling face. This 'Narrative Incongruence' most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The client has fully processed the trauma and is now at peace.",
                "A somatic-cognitive disconnect where the nervous system is using a 'masking' defense.",
                "The client is being untruthful about the severity of the event.",
                "The client is ready for immediate high-intensity sensation work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative Incongruence is a key indicator of a somatic-cognitive disconnect, suggesting the nervous system is employing a protective defense mechanism like 'fawning' or 'masking' to manage distress."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "In Neurobiological Synthesis (L2), the 'Dual Control Model' suggests that sexual arousal is a balance between the SES and SIS. A 2021 study showed that in clients with high anxiety, the most effective intervention is:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the strength of the Sexual Excitation System (SES).",
                "Using pharmacological stimulants to bypass the nervous system.",

                "Focusing exclusively on genital stimulation to override the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that for most clients, especially those with anxiety, 'removing the brakes' (lowering SIS) is more effective for arousal than simply 'pushing the gas' (increasing SES)."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "When bridging Sensation and Belief (L3), a client reports 'numbness' during a touch exercise. According to the Integration model, the practitioner should first investigate:",
            "options": [
                "The client's physical nerve endings for damage.",
                "The 'Cognitive Filter' or belief that may be signaling the brain to desensitize the area.",
                "The client's diet and hydration levels.",
                "The intensity of the touch, assuming it was simply too light."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Sensation-Belief loop, numbness is often a result of a cognitive filter (a belief like 'this is wrong' or 'I shouldn't feel this') that causes the brain to dampen sensory input."

                "The client's primary trauma trigger."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In relational synthesis, 'The Third' is the relationship itself, which has its own dynamics, needs, and 'personality' separate from the two individuals involved."

                "Combining multiple modalities in a single session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a trauma-informed strategy where the practitioner helps the client process sensory or emotional data in tiny 'drops' to prevent flooding or dissociation."

            "question": "Case Study: Marcus (38) presents with 'performance anxiety.' Case Conceptualization (L6) reveals he grew up in a household where 'perfection was the only option.' What is the 'Core Driver' in this synthesis?",

                "A lack of communication skills with his partner."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case conceptualization looks for the root; here, the belief that his value is tied to performance (perfection) triggers a 'fight or flight' response, inhibiting sexual function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reframing resistance as a 'Protective Ally' allows the practitioner to honor the client's internal safety boundaries rather than viewing the behavior as a failure."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'Safe and Social' state, which is neurobiologically required for the vulnerability and connection necessary for healthy sexual intimacy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner projects their own emotions or 'parts' onto the client. Recognizing 'parental' feelings is crucial for maintaining a professional scope and clean therapeutic container."
