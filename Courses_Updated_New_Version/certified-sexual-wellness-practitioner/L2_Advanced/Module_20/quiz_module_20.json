            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PAIR inventory measures both current (perceived) and desired (expected) levels of intimacy across five domains, allowing the practitioner to identify 'intimacy gaps' that cause relationship distress."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation involves looking for patterns and inconsistencies between different data sources (e.g., if a client's FSFI score shows high arousal but their somatic assessment shows high tension/guarding) to create a more accurate clinical picture."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
