            "question": "In the D.E.S.I.R.E. approach to trauma-informed sexual wellness, what does the first 'E' represent, and why is it prioritized immediately after de-escalation?",
            "options": [
                "Education; to provide the client with immediate facts about their trauma response.",
                "Empowerment; to return a sense of agency to the client who may feel 'stuck' or powerless.",
                "Evaluation; to assess the clinical severity of the trauma for referral purposes.",
                "Expression; to encourage the client to vocalize their trauma during the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowerment is the second step in the D.E.S.I.R.E. framework. After de-escalating the nervous system, the practitioner must focus on returning agency and choice to the client to counteract the powerlessness inherent in trauma."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Neurodivergent clients often experience challenges with 'Interoception.' How does this specifically manifest in a sexual context?",
            "options": [
                "An inability to understand the social cues of a partner during foreplay.",
                "Hypersensitivity to the texture of bedsheets or specific lighting.",
                "Difficulty recognizing internal physical sensations such as arousal, fullness, or the need to stop.",
                "A preference for repetitive sexual movements to maintain focus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Neurodivergent individuals may struggle to interpret internal signals, making it difficult to recognize when they are actually aroused or when they are reaching a point of overstimulation."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "When working with clients with chronic illness using the 'Spoon Theory' framework, what is the practitioner's primary goal regarding sexual intimacy?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client 'push through' fatigue to maintain relationship harmony.",
                "To treat sex as a 'zero-spoon' activity that should only happen on weekends.",
                "To assist the client in 'budgeting' energy units, potentially prioritizing intimacy over low-value chores.",
                "To eliminate physical sex in favor of purely emotional connection to save energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spoon Theory is a metaphor for energy conservation. In sexual wellness, practitioners help clients prioritize their limited 'spoons' (energy) for activities that provide the most fulfillment, which may involve planning sex during peak energy times."

            "question": "According to the Minority Stress Model, what is the difference between 'proximal' and 'distal' stressors for LGBTQIA+ clients?",
            "options": [
                "Proximal stressors are external (discrimination), while distal stressors are internal (internalized homophobia).",
                "Proximal stressors are internal (expectations of rejection), while distal stressors are external (prejudice events).",
                "Proximal stressors occur in childhood, while distal stressors occur in adulthood.",
                "Proximal stressors involve family, while distal stressors involve the workplace."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Distal stressors are objective environmental events (like laws or harassment), while proximal stressors are the subjective, internal processes that occur in response to those distal events, such as hypervigilance or concealment."

            "options": [
                "The pH becomes more acidic, increasing the risk of yeast infections.",
                "The vaginal walls become thicker and more elastic due to collagen shifts.",
                "The pH becomes more alkaline, and the tissues lose rugae (folds), leading to fragility.",
                "Blood flow to the labia majora increases to compensate for estrogen loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "With the decline of estrogen, the vaginal pH rises (becoming more alkaline), and the tissue undergoes atrophy, losing its rugae and elasticity, which often results in dyspareunia (painful intercourse)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Triple-A Engine describes how the internet made sexual content easily Accessible (24/7), Affordable (often free), and Anonymous (private consumption), which significantly altered sexual behavior patterns."

            "options": [
                "Immediately disclose these feelings to the client to model vulnerability.",
                "Terminate the client relationship to avoid any potential harm.",
                "Seek clinical supervision to process the feelings and ensure they do not impact the client's care.",
                "Ignore the feelings and focus strictly on the educational curriculum."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Countertransference is a natural occurrence where the practitioner's own emotions are triggered by the client. The ethical response is to process this in supervision or consultation to maintain professional boundaries and objectivity."

            "id": "q11_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Technoference refers to the intrusion of technology into interpersonal interactions. Creating boundaries like 'Digital Sunsets' (turning off devices at a certain time) or phone-free bedrooms helps reclaim space for intimacy."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Double Empathy Problem' in neurodiversity, where does the 'breakdown' in communication occur?",
            "options": [
                "Solely within the neurodivergent person's inability to empathize.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication difficulties between neurodivergent and neurotypical people are a 'two-way street' caused by a mutual lack of understanding of each other's different social perspectives and styles."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "During a case synthesis (L8), a practitioner works with a client who experiences 'dissociative freezing' during sex. Which D.E.S.I.R.E. step involves teaching the client 'Grounding Techniques'?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Regulation' step of the D.E.S.I.R.E. framework involves providing the client with specific tools (like 5-4-3-2-1 grounding or paced breathing) to manage their nervous system state and stay within their Window of Tolerance."
