            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "To identify and lower the 'brakes' (SIS) that prevent arousal from emerging",
                "To ensure the client never feels shame again",
                "To convince the client to engage in more adventurous sexual acts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Often, the 'problem' isn't a lack of desire (SES), but too many active inhibitors (SIS). Lowering the brakes is often more effective than pushing the accelerator."
