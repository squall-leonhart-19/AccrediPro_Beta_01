            "question": "According to Lesson 1, what is the primary clinical mechanism by which psychoeducation improves sexual function in clients?",
            "options": [
                "It serves as a direct replacement for pharmacological interventions.",
                "It reduces performance anxiety and shame by normalizing sexual experiences.",
                "It focuses exclusively on increasing the client's physiological testosterone levels.",
                "It eliminates the need for any further behavioral or somatic therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychoeducation works by demystifying sexual response, which reduces the 'spectatoring' effect and performance anxiety, thereby lowering the 'brakes' of the sexual response system."

            "question": "The Clitoral-Urethral-Vaginal (CUV) Complex model (Lesson 2) challenges traditional views of female anatomy by stating that:",
            "options": [
                "The clitoris is a small, external-only organ with no internal structures.",
                "Vaginal and clitoral orgasms are physiologically distinct and unrelated events.",
                "The clitoris, urethra, and anterior vaginal wall are functionally and anatomically linked during arousal.",
                "The G-spot is a distinct gland located deep within the cervix."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CUV Complex highlights the anatomical interconnectedness of these structures, suggesting that 'vaginal' stimulation actually involves the internal structures of the clitoris (bulbs and crura)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Basson's model introduced 'responsive desire,' which is highly relevant for long-term couples where desire often follows arousal rather than preceding it."

            "options": [
                "The individual is easily aroused by a wide variety of stimuli.",
                "The individual has a very high libido but low physical sensitivity.",
                "The individual's 'brakes' are easily activated by stress, fear, or distraction.",
                "The individual is likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A High SIS (Sexual Inhibition System) means the individual's brain is highly sensitive to reasons NOT to be turned on, such as stress, body image concerns, or fear of interruption."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that a significant majority (up to 80%) of women experience desire responsively, meaning it emerges after physical arousal has begun."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is likely experiencing responsive desire. Educating her that desire doesn't have to come first can relieve the guilt and 'brokenness' she feels for not initiating spontaneously."
