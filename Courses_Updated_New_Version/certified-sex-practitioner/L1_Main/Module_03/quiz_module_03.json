            "question": "In the context of Somatic Sexology, what is the primary distinction between 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' processing?",
            "options": [
                "Top-down focuses on cognitive reframing, while bottom-up prioritizes physiological sensation as the entry point for change.",
                "Bottom-up focuses on the brain's executive functions, while top-down focuses on the spinal cord.",
                "Top-down is only used for trauma, while bottom-up is used for pleasure enhancement.",
                "There is no functional distinction; both terms refer to the same neurological pathway."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic sexology emphasizes 'bottom-up' processing, which uses the body's sensations to influence the mind, whereas traditional talk therapy often relies on 'top-down' cognitive interventions."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which state of the autonomic nervous system is the 'biological requirement' for genuine sexual intimacy and play?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Activation (Fight/Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown (Freeze)",
                "Ventral Vagal Complex (Social Engagement System)",
                "The Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state provides the safety and connection necessary for the 'Social Engagement System' to function, allowing for vulnerability and pleasure without the interference of survival defenses."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client struggles to identify physical signs of arousal until they are at a '10 out of 10' intensity. Which neurological process likely requires strengthening?",
            "options": [
                "Proprioception",
                "Interoception",
                "Exteroception",
                "Neuroception"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the ability to sense the internal state of the body. Low interoceptive awareness often leads to a 'black or white' experience of arousal where subtle cues are missed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In Sensate Focus Level 1 (Non-Demand Touch), why are the genitals and breasts strictly excluded from the practice?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the transmission of bacteria during the healing phase.",
                "To ensure the practice remains purely platonic for the practitioner's safety.",
                "To remove the 'goal-orientation' of orgasm and reduce performance anxiety.",
                "Because these areas do not contain sensory receptors relevant to somatic integration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By removing 'sexual' zones, Sensate Focus Level 1 eliminates the pressure to perform or achieve a specific outcome (like an orgasm), allowing the individual to focus entirely on the sensation of touch."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "When working with a client who has a history of trauma, the practitioner notices the client becoming 'spaced out' and pale. Which somatic technique is most appropriate in this moment?",
            "options": [
                "Deep tissue pelvic floor release",
                "Titration: slowing down and focusing on a small, neutral sensation (like the feet on the floor)",
                "Catharsis: encouraging the client to scream to release the energy",
                "Increasing the intensity of the touch to 'wake up' the nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves breaking down overwhelming experiences into small, manageable pieces. Grounding the client in a neutral or safe sensation helps bring them back into their Window of Tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "What is the primary function of the Insular Cortex (Insula) in somatic sexology?",
            "options": [
                "It regulates the production of testosterone.",
                "It acts as the 'switching station' between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.",
                "It translates raw physiological data (heart rate, temperature) into subjective emotional feelings.",
                "It controls the voluntary contraction of the Pubococcygeus (PC) muscle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insula is the brain's interoceptive hub, responsible for processing internal bodily sensations and turning them into the 'felt sense' of an emotion or state of being."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A 'hypertonic' pelvic floor is most likely to contribute to which of the following sexual concerns?",
            "options": [
                "Erectile dysfunction due to lack of blood flow",
                "Dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and inability to relax during penetration",
                "Premature ejaculation due to excessive muscle weakness",
                "A complete lack of libido (desire)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypertonicity refers to muscles that are 'overly tight' or unable to relax. In the pelvic floor, this chronic tension is a leading cause of pelvic pain and painful penetration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the 'S' module, the term 'Pendulation' refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The rhythmic movement of the pelvis during coitus.",
                "The process of shifting attention between a place of 'resource/safety' and a place of 'tension/activation' in the body.",
                "The hormonal cycle of estrogen and progesterone.",
                "The use of weighted tools for pelvic floor strengthening."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is a somatic tracking technique where the client moves back and forth between a comfortable sensation and a challenging one to build nervous system resilience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Which specific neurotransmitter/hormone is most closely associated with the 'calm and connect' aspect of somatic touch and Ventral Vagal activation?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Adrenaline",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Thyroxine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is often called the 'bonding hormone' and is released during safe, somatic touch, facilitating trust and reducing the activity of the amygdala (fear center)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "According to the module, what is the 'Spectatoring' effect, and how does somatic mindfulness help?",
            "options": [
                "It is a form of voyeurism; mindfulness encourages it.",
                "It is the act of 'watching oneself' during sex from an external perspective; mindfulness brings the focus back to internal sensation.",
                "It is a lack of visual stimulation; mindfulness encourages the use of erotic imagery.",
                "It is a neurological disorder; mindfulness acts as a cognitive cure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spectatoring is a common cause of performance anxiety where a person becomes an observer of their own sexual performance. Somatic mindfulness anchors the individual in the present, internal sensory experience, breaking the cycle of self-judgment."
