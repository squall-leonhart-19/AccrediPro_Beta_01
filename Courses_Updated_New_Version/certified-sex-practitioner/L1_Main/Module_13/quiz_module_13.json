            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen) discussed in Lesson 1, desire discrepancy often occurs when one partner has a highly sensitive Sexual Excitation System (SES) and the other has a highly sensitive:",
            "options": [
                "Sexual Inhibition System (SIS)",
                "Somatic Arousal Pathway (SAP)",

                "Autonomic Response Trigger (ART)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model posits that sexual response involves a balance between excitation (SES) and inhibition (SIS). Discrepancy often arises when one partner's 'brakes' (SIS) are more easily activated than the other's."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Sexual Anhedonia' is described as a condition where the physical components of arousal occur, but the subjective experience of pleasure is absent. This is primarily linked to dysfunction in which neurochemical pathway?",
            "options": [
                "The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake pathway",
                "The mesolimbic dopamine 'reward' system",

                "The parasympathetic acetylcholine release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sexual Anhedonia is often characterized by a 'pleasure gap' where the physical mechanics work, but the mesolimbic dopamine system fails to register the experience as rewarding or pleasurable."

            "question": "When dismantling religious sexual shame (Lesson 3), what is the primary objective of 'Somatic Deconditioning'?",

                "To encourage the client to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors to 'break the seal'",
                "To retrain the Autonomic Nervous System to stop associating pleasure with a threat response",
                "To replace religious rituals with secular mindfulness meditation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Religious shame is often stored somatically as a 'freeze' or 'fawn' response. Deconditioning focuses on recalibrating the nervous system so it no longer triggers a survival/threat response during moments of intimacy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental Engineering specifically refers to the physical space and tools used to accommodate the body's limitations, such as using ergonomic aids to manage pain or fatigue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rapid breathing and dilated pupils are physiological markers of the sympathetic nervous system's 'fight/flight' response, indicating the client has moved into hyper-arousal."
