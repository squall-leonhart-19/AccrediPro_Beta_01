            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen) discussed in Lesson 1, sexual inhibition is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "A lack of sufficient sexual excitation (SES)",
                "An active physiological process (SIS) that functions independently of excitation",
                "A purely psychological state caused by religious upbringing",
                "The result of low testosterone or hormonal imbalances"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model posits that excitation (SES) and inhibition (SIS) are two separate, independent neurological systems. Inhibition is not just 'low arousal' but an active 'brake' system in the brain."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the distinction between sexual shame and sexual guilt is critical. Which statement best defines 'Sexual Shame'?",
            "options": [
                "A feeling of remorse for a specific sexual action that violated one's values",
                "A healthy boundary that prevents risky sexual behavior",
                "A painful, global evaluation of the self as being 'bad,' 'broken,' or 'unworthy' due to sexual desires",
                "The social pressure to conform to monogamous standards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shame is identity-based ('I am bad'), whereas guilt is behavior-based ('I did something bad'). Shame is more corrosive to sexual health because it attacks the individual's sense of worthiness."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Gagnon and Simon's 'Sexual Scripting Theory' (Lesson 3) suggests that sexual behavior is guided by three levels of scripts. What are they?",
            "options": [
                "Biological, Psychological, and Social",
                "Cultural Scenarios, Interpersonal Scripts, and Intrapsychic Scripts",

                "Conscious, Subconscious, and Unconscious"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sexual scripts operate at the level of Cultural Scenarios (social norms), Interpersonal Scripts (interactional cues), and Intrapsychic Scripts (individual fantasies and desires)."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A client believes that 'real men should always be ready for sex.' This is an example of a 'limiting sexual belief.' Which technique from Lesson 4 is most effective for deconstructing this?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Downward Arrow' technique to find the core fear behind the belief",
                "Suppression of the thought through distraction",
                "Increasing the dosage of erectile dysfunction medication",
                "Aversion therapy to associate the thought with discomfort"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Downward Arrow' technique is a cognitive-behavioral tool used to uncover the underlying core beliefs and catastrophic fears that drive surface-level sexual anxieties."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Masters and Johnson defined 'Spectatoring' (Lesson 5) as a primary cause of sexual dysfunction. What is the core mechanism of spectatoring?",
            "options": [
                "Watching pornography while engaging in sexual activity",
                "An individual's tendency to mentally step outside themselves to monitor their performance or appearance",
                "The fear of being walked in on by a third party during intimacy",
                "Excessive focus on the partner's pleasure at the expense of one's own"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spectatoring is the process of self-monitoring from a third-person perspective, which shifts the brain from a sensory-receptive state to a self-critical, evaluative state, often killing arousal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "To overcome performance anxiety (Lesson 6), practitioners often recommend 'Sensate Focus.' What is the primary goal of this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the partner reaches orgasm through manual stimulation",
                "To increase the duration of intercourse",
                "To shift from goal-oriented sex (orgasm) to process-oriented sex (sensory awareness)",
                "To improve the aesthetic appearance of the body during sex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensate Focus is designed to remove the pressure of 'performance' (erection or orgasm) and re-center the individual on the actual physical sensations occurring in the moment."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 7), which state of the nervous system is required for a person to feel safe enough for sexual intimacy and 'vulnerability'?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Nervous System (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal Complex (Shutdown/Freeze)",
                "Ventral Vagal Stabilization (Social Engagement System)",
                "The Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' branch of the nervous system. Without this sense of safety, the body remains in a state of defense (fight, flight, or freeze), which inhibits sexual receptivity."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Radical Self-Permission.' In a clinical setting, how is this typically cultivated?",
            "options": [
                "By telling the client to 'just do whatever feels good'",
                "Through the use of 'Yes/No/Maybe' lists to establish erotic agency and boundaries",
                "By encouraging the client to ignore their partner's needs entirely",
                "By prescribing 'liquid courage' (alcohol) to lower inhibitions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radical self-permission is built through active agency. Tools like the 'Yes/No/Maybe' list help clients identify their authentic desires and set boundaries, which reduces the anxiety of the unknown."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "CASE STUDY: Sarah, 34, reports she cannot reach orgasm with her partner because she is constantly worried about how her stomach looks from certain angles. Which concept from Module 4 is she primarily experiencing?",

                "Primary Anorgasmia",
                "Spectatoring driven by body dissatisfaction",
                "Low Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) activation",
                "Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is 'spectatoring'—mentally observing her body from her partner's perspective—which creates a cognitive distraction that prevents the processing of erotic stimuli."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A 2021 study cited in the module found that individuals with high 'Sexual Shame' scores showed what physiological response during sexual stimuli?",
            "options": [
                "Increased genital blood flow compared to low-shame individuals",
                "No difference in physiological response compared to the control group",
                "Significant increase in cortisol levels and reduced genital arousal response",
                "Immediate transition into a Ventral Vagal state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sexual shame triggers a stress response. High levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) act as a physiological antagonist to sexual arousal, effectively shutting down the body's sexual response system."
