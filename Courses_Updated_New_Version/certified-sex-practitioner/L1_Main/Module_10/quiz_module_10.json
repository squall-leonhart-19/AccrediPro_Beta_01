            "question": "A client with a history of sexual trauma begins to breathe shallowly, stares blankly at the wall, and reports feeling 'numb' or 'faded' during a somatic exercise. According to the Window of Tolerance, which state is the client experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-arousal (Fight/Flight)",
                "The Optimal Zone of Arousal",
                "Hypo-arousal (Freeze/Collapse)",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by numbness, dissociation, and a 'shut down' response. In trauma-informed care, this indicates the client has moved outside their Window of Tolerance into a dorsal vagal state."

            "question": "When adapting the D.E.S.I.R.E. framework for a client with ADHD, which modification is most effective for addressing 'executive dysfunction' in the bedroom?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating all structure to allow for total spontaneity",
                "Using 'Dopamine Priming' by incorporating novelty and reducing transition friction",
                "Focusing exclusively on long-term emotional connection without physical stimuli",
                "Increasing the duration of traditional foreplay to 60+ minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For ADHD brains, dopamine is the primary driver of interest. Reducing friction (the effort to start) and adding novelty helps bypass executive function hurdles that often make initiating sex feel like a 'chore.'"

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A client with Fibromyalgia (Chronic Pain) is struggling with 'Spoon Theory' application in their sex life. What is the practitioner's best recommendation for 'Energy Budgeting'?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the client to push through the pain to maintain intimacy",
                "Suggest 'Low-Spoon' intimacy options like mutual masturbation or sensory cuddling",
                "Recommend only having sex in the morning when energy is highest, regardless of desire",
                "Focus solely on psychological intimacy until the physical flare-up is completely gone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy budgeting involves adapting the physicality of pleasure to match the client's current 'spoon' count. 'Low-Spoon' options allow for connection without the high metabolic cost of vigorous intercourse."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which state must be active for a client to experience 'Safe Mobilization' (playful, energetic sex without triggering a fight/flight response)?",

                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",
                "Pure Sympathetic Activation",

                "Total Parasympathetic Stillness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safe mobilization (play) requires the Ventral Vagal system (the 'brake') to remain active while the Sympathetic system (energy) is engaged, ensuring the high energy is interpreted as fun rather than a threat."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client begins to view the practitioner as a 'savior' and expresses that the practitioner is the only person who truly understands their sexual needs. This is a classic example of:",

                "Informed Consent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transference occurs when a client redirects feelings for significant others toward the practitioner. When these feelings involve idealized or romanticized views, it is categorized as eroticized transference and requires careful boundary management."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which physiological change is a hallmark of the Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) that practitioners should address with clients in the 'Aging and Hormones' phase?",
            "options": [

                "Excessive lubrication leading to reduced friction",
                "Permanent loss of the ability to reach orgasm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "GSM involves a rise in vaginal pH (making it less acidic) and thinning of the tissues due to declining estrogen, which can cause pain (dyspareunia) if not managed with proper lubricants or medical intervention."

            "question": "When a practitioner encounters a 'Therapeutic Impasse' where the client repeatedly 'forgets' to do homework or misses sessions, what does the 'Framework Stalls' lesson suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The client is not motivated and should be discharged immediately",
                "The practitioner should increase the difficulty of the homework to challenge the client",
                "The 'resistance' is likely a protective mechanism of the client's nervous system",
                "The practitioner should switch to a purely business-focused coaching model"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In advanced practice, resistance is viewed as 'protection.' If a framework stalls, it usually means the client's nervous system perceives the change as a threat, requiring a return to safety and stabilization."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In 'The Business of Empowerment,' what is the primary reason for a Sex Practitioner to establish a 'Niche' or 'Specialization'?",
            "options": [
                "To exclude clients who cannot afford premium rates",
                "To reduce the cognitive load of the practitioner and increase clinical efficacy",
                "To avoid having to learn about different types of sexual dysfunction",
                "To ensure the practitioner never has to deal with trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialization allows the practitioner to develop deep expertise, which reduces the mental 'switching cost' between diverse cases and significantly improves client outcomes through targeted interventions."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "For a client on the Autism Spectrum, which sensory adaptation is most likely to improve their experience of intimacy?",
            "options": [
                "Using 'Deep Pressure' (proprioceptive input) to help ground the nervous system",
                "Increasing the number of scented candles and bright lights for stimulation",
                "Encouraging eye contact throughout the entire sexual encounter",
                "Focusing on light, 'ticklish' touch to increase sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Many Autistic individuals find deep pressure grounding and soothing (proprioceptive input), whereas light touch or high-sensory environments (smells/lights) can lead to sensory overload or 'meltdown' states."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A 65-year-old male client reports difficulty maintaining erections and a drop in libido. A 2021 meta-analysis suggests that beyond testosterone levels, practitioners should first screen for:",

                "The frequency of the client's dreams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Erectile function is often a 'canary in the coal mine' for cardiovascular health. Before assuming a purely psychological or hormonal cause, practitioners must consider systemic blood flow and endothelial health in aging populations."
