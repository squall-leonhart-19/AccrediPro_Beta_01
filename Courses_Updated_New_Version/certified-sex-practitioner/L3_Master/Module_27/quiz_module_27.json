            "question": "A client with ADHD reports that they often 'lose the thread' during foreplay or find their mind wandering to household chores, leading to a loss of arousal. Which executive function challenge is this most indicative of?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperfocus",
                "Emotional dysregulation",
                "Task persistence and distractibility",
                "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Executive function challenges in neurodivergent individuals often manifest as distractibility during sex, where the brain struggles to maintain focus on the sensory experience, leading to a drop in physiological arousal."

            "question": "What is the fundamental clinical distinction between the 'Safe, Sane, and Consensual' (SSC) framework and the 'Risk-Aware Consensual Kink' (RACK) philosophy?",
            "options": [
                "RACK is only used for non-consensual activities.",
                "SSC implies that activities can be made perfectly safe, while RACK acknowledges inherent risks that cannot be fully eliminated.",
                "SSC is for beginners and RACK is for advanced practitioners only.",
                "RACK requires a legal contract while SSC is a verbal agreement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink) is often preferred in advanced BDSM communities because it acknowledges that certain activities (like breath play or suspension) carry inherent risks that 'safe' may oversimplify, placing the focus on informed risk management."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spoon Theory, developed by Christine Miserandino, helps clients with chronic illness or disability quantify their limited energy reserves, allowing them to plan sexual activity as a 'high-spoon' expenditure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When sex becomes a clinical task focused on conception, it often loses its recreational and connective value, leading to performance anxiety, erectile difficulties, and a loss of libido in both partners."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gender Euphoria focuses on the positive aspects of gender expression and identity that enhance sexual pleasure and comfort, rather than just managing the distress of dysphoria."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A paraphilia is an atypical sexual interest; it only becomes a 'disorder' if it causes the individual distress/impairment or if the fulfillment of the interest involves non-consenting persons (harm)."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Why might a client on the Autism spectrum find the 'protocol' and 'negotiation' aspects of BDSM particularly accessible and affirming?",
            "options": [
                "Because they lack the ability to feel pain.",
                "Because BDSM provides explicit rules, clear communication, and removes the ambiguity of traditional social/sexual cues.",
                "Because neurodivergent individuals are biologically predisposed to kink.",
                "Because it allows them to avoid making eye contact entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The explicit communication and 'scripts' found in Kink/BDSM negotiation reduce the social anxiety and 'mind-reading' that often make standard sexual interactions challenging for neurodivergent individuals."
