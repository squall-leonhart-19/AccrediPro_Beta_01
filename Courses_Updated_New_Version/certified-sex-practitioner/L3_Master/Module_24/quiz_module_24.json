            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Structural shame is a result of societal power structures (racism, homophobia, sexism) that pathologize certain identities, making it a systemic rather than purely psychological issue."

            "explanation": "Ethical leadership distinguishes between crossings (e.g., attending a client's wedding) which may benefit the therapeutic alliance, and violations (e.g., sexual contact) which cause harm."
