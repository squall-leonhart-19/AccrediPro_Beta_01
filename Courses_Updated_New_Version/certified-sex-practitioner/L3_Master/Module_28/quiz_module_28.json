                "Deep emotional processing of the underlying childhood wound",

                "Immediate referral to an inpatient psychiatric facility regardless of symptom severity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In acute crisis intervention, the immediate priority is stabilization—ensuring the client is physically safe and helping them regulate their nervous system before any deep psychological or somatic processing can occur."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Structural dissociation involves a split where the ANP handles daily functioning while the EP holds the traumatic memories and defensive responses, a common feature in complex trauma cases."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Per the DSM-5-TR, a paraphilia is an interest, but it only becomes a 'disorder' if it causes personal distress/impairment or involves harm/lack of consent to others."

            ],

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires a risk assessment. Fantasies alone are not reportable offenses; the practitioner must determine if there is an imminent threat of harm before breaking confidentiality."
