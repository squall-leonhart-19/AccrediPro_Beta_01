            "options": [
                "Erotic Expression; to showcase the practitioner's personal preferences.",
                "Empathic Expertise; to establish authority while maintaining a safe, non-judgmental space.",

                "Ethical Engagement; to ensure all social media posts follow platform algorithms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empathic Expertise (the second 'E' in D.E.S.I.R.E.) is critical because sexual wellness clients require a unique balance of clinical authority and deep emotional safety before they are willing to invest."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Platforms generally permit sexual health content if it is clearly educational or medical. While 'algospeak' is common, the most sustainable strategy is establishing a clinical/educational context that AI moderators recognize as health-related."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tier-1 partners are those who see the client at the moment the specific problem is identified. For prostate cancer recovery, urologists and oncology nurses are the primary points of contact."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Leaky Funnel' usually refers to a breakdown between stages. High traffic with very low conversion (0.5% is significantly below the 20-30% industry standard for lead magnets) indicates the 'leak' is on the landing page."
