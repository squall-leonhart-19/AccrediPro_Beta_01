            "options": [
                "Because they are the same neurological pathway",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SIS and SES represent independent 'accelerator' and 'brake' systems; a client may be easily aroused (High SES) but also easily shut down by stress or shame (High SIS)."
