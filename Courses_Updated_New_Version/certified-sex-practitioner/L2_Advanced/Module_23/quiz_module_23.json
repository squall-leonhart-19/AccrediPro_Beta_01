            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory in sexual healing, which state must the nervous system primarily occupy to experience 'Safe Mobilization' (arousal without fear)?",
            "options": [
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",
                "Sympathetic Hyper-arousal",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "Functional Freeze"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safe mobilization requires the Ventral Vagal system to be active, providing a 'vagal brake' that allows the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate and arousal without triggering a fight-or-flight response."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In Erotic Blueprinting, a client who is primarily 'Energetic' is most likely to be turned on by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Direct genital stimulation and high-intensity friction",
                "The anticipation, space, and 'tease' before any physical touch occurs",
                "High-protocol power dynamics and clear rules",
                "A clean environment with specific lighting and high-thread-count sheets"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetics are sensitive to the 'unseen' and are often turned on by the energy between people, anticipation, and light or no-touch hovering."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "When using Advanced Narrative Therapy to deconstruct core inhibitions, what is the primary purpose of 'Externalization'?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to take full responsibility for their sexual failures",
                "To visualize the partner as the source of the sexual dysfunction",
                "To separate the client's identity from the 'Problem Story' (e.g., 'The Shame' vs. 'I am shameful')",
                "To express sexual frustrations loudly to release pent-up energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Externalization helps clients view the inhibition as an outside force they can negotiate with, rather than a fixed part of their personality, reducing shame and increasing agency."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "In Advanced Relational Mechanics, the 'Erotic Conflict Cycle' usually involves a 'Pursuer' and a 'Withdrawer.' What is the recommended intervention for the Pursuer?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the frequency of their sexual requests to 'break' the cycle",

                "Use 'Shame-Loading' to make the partner realize what they are missing",
                "Stop all sexual activity for 90 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By self-soothing, the Pursuer reduces the perceived threat to the Withdrawer, which often creates the safety necessary for the Withdrawer to naturally lean back into the connection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Circular breathing can lead to temporary respiratory alkalosis, which often lowers cognitive defenses and allows for the surfacing of suppressed somatic emotions and 'body memories.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged eye contact facilitates limbic resonance, allowing the nervous systems of two people to regulate one another and deepen the sense of safety and intimacy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The specific data indicates that 'Blueprinting' provides a non-shaming language for differences, leading to significantly higher satisfaction rates (approx. 64%) compared to standard clinical approaches."
