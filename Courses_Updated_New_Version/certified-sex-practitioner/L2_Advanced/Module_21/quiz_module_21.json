            "options": [
                "A diagnosis is used for billing, while formulation is only for research purposes.",
                "A diagnosis labels the symptoms, whereas a formulation provides a narrative map of why the problem persists and how to change it.",
                "A diagnosis is made by a doctor, and a formulation is made by a coach.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in sex therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Formulation goes beyond a label (diagnosis) to explain the etiology, maintaining factors, and psychological mechanisms that drive the client's specific presentation."

            "question": "The DESIRE framework for sequencing interventions (L2) suggests that 'Education and Normalization' should occur early because:",
            "options": [
                "It reduces shame and lowers autonomic arousal, making the client more receptive to behavioral changes.",
                "It allows the practitioner to avoid talking about difficult emotions.",
                "Clients usually already know the facts, so it's a quick way to build rapport.",
                "It is the only intervention required for most sexual dysfunctions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Education and Normalization act as a 'cognitive lubricant,' reducing the shame that often keeps the nervous system in a state of high arousal or defense."

            "question": "When coordinating care for a client experiencing erectile dysfunction (ED) that may be linked to both performance anxiety and cardiovascular health (L3), what is the practitioner's first priority?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multidisciplinary integration requires ensuring that physiological 'red flags' are addressed by medical professionals before or alongside psychological interventions."

            "question": "A client in the 'Resistance' phase (L4) consistently fails to complete Sensate Focus exercises. How should a Practitioner view this behavior?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign that the client is lazy and unmotivated.",
                "As a clinical data point suggesting the current intervention exceeds the client's current 'Window of Tolerance.'",
                "As a reason to terminate the therapeutic relationship immediately.",
                "As a personal rejection of the practitioner's expertise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In treatment planning, resistance is viewed as a functional protection of the nervous system, signaling that the pace or type of intervention needs adjustment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Culturally responsive planning recognizes that external stressors (discrimination, stigma) directly impact internal sexual self-concept and physiological arousal."

            "options": [
                "To determine which partner started the problem.",
                "To prove to the couple that they are both equally wrong.",
                "To shift the focus from 'who is to blame' to 'how the interactional loop maintains the symptom.'",
                "To ensure the practitioner remains the dominant authority in the room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circular causality moves the plan away from individual pathology toward a systemic understanding of how partners' behaviors trigger and reinforce one another."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintenance is about empowerment and self-efficacy—equipping the client to be their own 'practitioner' when future challenges arise."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In trauma-informed planning, safety and stabilization must precede any physical intervention or deep trauma processing to prevent re-traumatization."

                "Plateaus rarely occur if the correct diagnosis is made at the start.",
                "Approximately 30-40% of plateaus in sexual therapy involve unaddressed medical factors or 'secondary gain' within the relationship system.",
                "Plateaus are a sign that therapy will never work for that client."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests a significant portion of stalled progress is due to 'hidden' factors like medical issues or systemic benefits to keeping the problem (secondary gain)."
