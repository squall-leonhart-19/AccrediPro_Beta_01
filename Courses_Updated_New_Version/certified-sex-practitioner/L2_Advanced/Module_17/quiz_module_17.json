            "question": "When working with a trauma survivor who enters a state of 'hypo-arousal' (numbing or dissociation) during a session, what is the practitioner's immediate priority according to the Window of Tolerance model?",
            "options": [
                "Deepening the emotional processing of the trauma",
                "Utilizing grounding techniques to return the client to the regulated zone",

                "Increasing the intensity of the sensory stimuli to wake the nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal indicates the client has fallen below their Window of Tolerance. The priority is safety and regulation through grounding before any further therapeutic work can occur."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD often involves executive dysfunction where the brain struggles to filter out external or internal distractions, frequently interrupting the 'erotic flow' during intimacy."

                "The act of reading research while a client is speaking",
                "A method of treating trauma and sexual dysfunction in the same hour"
