            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen), which specific inhibitory system is most closely linked to 'performance anxiety' and the fear of sexual failure?",
            "options": [
                "Sexual Excitation System (SES)",
                "Sexual Inhibition System 1 (SIS-1)",
                "Sexual Inhibition System 2 (SIS-2)",
                "The Limbic Reward Pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SIS-2 is specifically associated with the inhibition of sexual response due to the threat of performance failure or social consequences, whereas SIS-1 is related to the threat of physical danger or contagion."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the landmark research by Brotto et al. (2016) regarding Mindfulness-Based Sex Therapy (MBST), what was identified as the primary mechanism for improving sexual desire in women?",
            "options": [
                "Reduction in cortisol levels",
                "Increased interoceptive awareness and reduced 'spectatoring'",
                "Direct stimulation of the prefrontal cortex",
                "Elimination of all relational conflict"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The research demonstrated that MBST works primarily by increasing interoceptive awareness (attending to internal bodily sensations) and decreasing 'spectatoring' (self-judgmental self-observation)."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Longitudinal studies by the Gottman Institute suggest that stable, 'master' couples maintain a specific ratio of positive to negative interactions during conflict. What is this ratio?",
            "options": [
                "1:1",
                "3:1",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Magic Ratio' identified in longitudinal research is 5:1, meaning stable couples have five positive interactions for every one negative interaction during conflict."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Neurobiological evidence regarding sexual shame suggests that chronic exposure to societal 'purity culture' can lead to which physiological state during attempted intimacy?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-activation of the Ventral Vagal complex",
                "Chronic HPA-axis activation resulting in high cortisol and sexual avoidance",

                "Suppression of the Amygdala"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic shame acts as a chronic stressor, activating the HPA axis and elevating cortisol, which physiologically inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system necessary for sexual arousal."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "When reviewing endocrine labs, a practitioner notes high levels of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG). What is the clinical implication for the client's sexual function?",
            "options": [
                "Increased libido due to hormone stabilization",
                "Lower 'free' (bioavailable) testosterone, potentially decreasing desire",
                "Increased sensitivity to estrogen",
                "Rapid recovery during the refractory period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone; therefore, high levels of SHBG mean less 'free' or bioavailable testosterone is available to the tissues, often resulting in lower libido even if total testosterone appears normal."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "According to Porges' Polyvagal Theory, which state is a client experiencing if they report 'feeling nothing' or 'going numb' during sexual contact after a history of trauma?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Mobilization",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "Dorsal Vagal Immobilization (Freeze/Shutdown)",
                "Hyper-arousal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal complex mediates the 'freeze' or 'shutdown' response, which is characterized by dissociation, numbness, and a lack of physiological arousal in response to perceived threat."

                "Medication alone is always superior for long-term satisfaction",
                "Behavioral therapy has no effect on physiological erectile function",
                "Combined therapy (medication + behavioral) yields the highest long-term efficacy and lowest relapse rates",
                "Medication is ineffective for ED with a psychological component"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that while medication addresses the symptom, combined therapy addresses both the physiological mechanics and the underlying anxiety/relational factors, leading to better long-term outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a key trauma-informed principle that involves slowing down the process to ensure the client stays within their Window of Tolerance, avoiding re-traumatization."

                "Prolactin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolactin levels rise significantly following orgasm in males, which suppresses dopamine (the primary driver of sexual desire) and creates the physiological refractory period."
