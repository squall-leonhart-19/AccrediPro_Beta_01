            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universality is the recognition that one is not alone in their suffering, which is a primary psychological benefit of peer support groups for pet loss."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Releasing phase focuses on the 'stuck' points of the loss, allowing participants to process the trauma of the death itself before moving toward integration."

            "question": "A participant in your group is 'monopolizing' the conversation, taking up 20 minutes of a 60-minute session. According to Lesson 3, what is the most effective facilitation technique to use?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Facilitators must manage the 'monopolizer' by validating the emotion ('I can hear how much you miss Max') and then pivoting to the group ('Who else has experienced that same sense of silence in the house?')."

                "To prove to others how much the pet was loved",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Legacy projects help clients move from a 'broken bond' to a 'continuing bond' by creating a physical representation of their ongoing love for the pet."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In virtual pet loss support, seeing faces (Gallery View) allows the facilitator to monitor for safety risks and 'emotional contagion' that may require intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pet Grief Specialists must recognize the 'Scope of Practice' boundaries; persistent suicidal ideation or severe clinical depression requires a referral to a licensed clinician."

            "options": [
                "It is a physical illness spread through group contact",
                "It is the spread of affect/emotion from one member to the group, which can lead to collective overwhelm",
                "It is a marketing term for how groups grow in size",
                "It is the process of members becoming friends outside of group"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional contagion occurs when one member's intense distress 'infects' the room; facilitators must use grounding techniques to ensure the group remains a container, not a vacuum of despair."

                "Closed enrollment (no new members after Week 1 or 2)",
