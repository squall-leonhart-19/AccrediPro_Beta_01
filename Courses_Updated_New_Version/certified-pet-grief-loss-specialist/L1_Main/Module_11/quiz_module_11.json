            "options": [
                "Because it is a form of grief that is socially unacknowledged or invalidated",
                "Because pet owners often refuse to seek professional help",
                "Because the grief period for animals is scientifically shorter than for humans",
                "Because it only applies to exotic or non-traditional pets"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a loss is not openly acknowledged, socially validated, or publicly observed, which is common in pet bereavement."

                "A ritual must involve more than three people to be effective",
                "A ritual is a conscious, intentional act designed to transition from one state to another",
                "A ritual must be expensive or involve professional services",
