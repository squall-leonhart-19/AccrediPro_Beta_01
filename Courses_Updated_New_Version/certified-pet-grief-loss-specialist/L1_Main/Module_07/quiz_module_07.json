            "question": "According to the neurobiological research by Nagasawa et al. (2015), what specific physiological change occurs in humans during mutual gaze with their dogs?",
            "options": [
                "A 300% increase in oxytocin levels",
                "A 50% decrease in heart rate",
                "A doubling of dopamine production",
                "A 40% reduction in cortisol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Nagasawa's landmark study demonstrated that mutual gaze between dogs and owners creates an oxytocin-mediated positive loop, with human oxytocin levels increasing by approximately 300%."

            "question": "Kenneth Doka’s concept of 'Disenfranchised Grief' is best applied to pet loss when which of the following occurs?",
            "options": [
                "The owner experiences more than six months of active mourning",
                "The loss is not socially recognized, validated, or supported by the surrounding community",
                "The pet died due to a preventable accident",
                "The owner decides to adopt a new pet immediately after the loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when the mourner's relationship, the loss, or the mourner themselves are not recognized by society, leading to isolation and 'grief over grief.'"

            "question": "During an 'Environmental Audit' (Lesson 4), what is the primary therapeutic goal of identifying 'sensory landmines'?",
            "options": [
                "To remove all pet-related items from the home immediately",
                "To help the client prepare for and manage the acute physiological triggers of the 'physical void'",
                "To encourage the client to redecorate their living space to forget the pet",
                "To determine which items should be donated to a local shelter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental audits help clients navigate the physical space where the pet's absence is most felt, allowing them to manage sensory triggers like the sound of a collar or the sight of an empty food bowl."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "In the context of euthanasia, the term 'Moral Injury' refers to which psychological phenomenon?",
            "options": [

                "The conflict between the owner's religious beliefs and the act of euthanasia",
                "The distress resulting from an action that transgresses deeply held moral beliefs or expectations",
                "The anger directed at a veterinarian for a perceived lack of empathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Moral injury occurs when a client feels they have violated their own moral code (e.g., 'I was supposed to protect them') by choosing euthanasia, even when it was the most humane option."

            "id": "q7_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Continuing Bonds theory posits that healthy grief involves maintaining a symbolic connection with the deceased rather than severing ties, allowing the pet to remain a part of the owner's internal life."

            "question": "When working with neurodivergent clients (Lesson 7), why might pet loss be particularly destabilizing?",
            "options": [
                "Because pets often serve as a primary 'anchor' for sensory regulation and social safety",
                "Because neurodivergent individuals do not understand the concept of death",
                "Because they are less likely to seek professional counseling",
                "Because they lack the capacity for oxytocin production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "For many neurodivergent individuals, pets provide a predictable, non-judgmental sensory anchor. The loss of this anchor can lead to significant dysregulation and a loss of their primary coping mechanism."

            "question": "A client reports 'hearing' their deceased dog's paws clicking on the hardwood floor two weeks after the loss. As a specialist, how should you interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign of a developing psychotic break requiring immediate referral",
                "As a common 'sensory hallucination' or search behavior typical of acute grief",
                "As evidence that the client is not yet ready for ritualization",
                "As a sign that the client has not properly completed the environmental audit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory hallucinations (hearing, seeing, or feeling the pet) are extremely common in the acute phase of pet loss as the brain continues to 'search' for the missing attachment figure."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Ritual of Transition' as discussed in Lesson 5?",

                "Writing a check to pay for the cremation services"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rituals of transition provide a symbolic framework for the 'liminal space' of grief, helping the owner move from a physical connection to a symbolic one."

            "question": "What does 'Reflective Processing' in Lesson 3 primarily aim to accomplish regarding end-of-life trauma?",

                "Forgetting the traumatic details of the death",
                "Reframing the 'trauma narrative' to integrate the entire life of the pet rather than just the final moments",
                "Encouraging the client to sue for veterinary malpractice",
                "Validating that the trauma was entirely the owner's fault"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective processing helps clients move past 'trauma looping' (focusing only on the death) by integrating the final moments into the broader, positive narrative of the pet's whole life."

                "The ability to live independently",
                "Their religious faith"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For seniors, a pet often provides the primary reason for a daily routine and serves as a bridge for social interaction (e.g., talking to neighbors while walking the dog). Loss of the pet means losing these vital social and functional structures."
