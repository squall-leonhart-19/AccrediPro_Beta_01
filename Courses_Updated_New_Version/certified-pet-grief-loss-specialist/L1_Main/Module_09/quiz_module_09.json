            "question": "Which neurochemical is primarily responsible for the 'secure base' attachment observed between humans and their pets, often reaching levels comparable to parent-infant bonding during eye contact?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Oxytocin", "Serotonin", "Epinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, often called the 'bonding hormone,' is released in both humans and dogs during interaction, facilitating the deep emotional attachment and sense of security central to the human-animal bond."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "A client reports that their social circle dismisses their grief with comments like 'it was just a cat.' This lack of societal recognition for the loss is known as:",
            "options": ["Complicated grief", "Disenfranchised grief", "Anticipatory grief", "Inhibited grief"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a loss is not openly acknowledged, socially validated, or publicly observed, which is a common experience for those grieving the death of a pet."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the context of Narrative Reconstruction (L3), what is the primary purpose of 'restorying' the loss?",
            "options": ["To help the client forget the traumatic details of the death", "To create a fictionalized happy ending to ease the pain", "To integrate the loss into the survivor's overarching life narrative", "To distract the client from the physical absence of the pet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative reconstruction aims to help the griever make sense of the 'broken' story of the loss and integrate it into their life history in a way that provides meaning and continuity."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Why are 'ghosting' phenomena—such as hearing a collar jingle or seeing a pet in their usual spot—considered a normal part of pet bereavement?",
            "options": ["They indicate a temporary psychotic break due to trauma", "They are caused by established neural pathways and sensory habits associated with the pet's presence", "They are a sign that the client is refusing to accept the reality of the loss", "They only occur in cases where the pet died in a violent or sudden manner"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The brain's sensory systems and 'spatial maps' are conditioned to the pet's presence; when the pet is gone, the brain may continue to 'fill in the blanks' based on long-standing habits and neural pathways."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "When developing rituals for closure (L5), what is meant by the 'Double-Edged Sword' of symbolic acts?",
            "options": ["Rituals are too expensive for most grieving families", "Rituals provide necessary structure but can also trigger intense, acute waves of grief", "Rituals are only effective for children and don't help adults", "Rituals replace the need for clinical intervention entirely"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While rituals provide a structured way to express grief and find closure, the act of performing them can also bring the reality of the loss into sharp, painful focus, triggering acute emotional responses."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Which concept involves extracting a 'legacy' from the pet's life to foster post-traumatic growth and provide a sense of purpose?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meaning-making is the process of finding significant value or lessons in the pet's life and death, often leading to legacy projects or personal growth that honors the pet."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "The 'Continuing Bonds' theory (L7) suggests that healthy grieving is characterized by:",
            "options": ["Severing all emotional ties to the deceased to move forward", "Adopting a new pet immediately to fill the emotional vacuum", "Shifting from a physical relationship to an internalized emotional connection", "Maintaining the pet's physical environment exactly as it was forever"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Continuing bonds theory posits that it is healthy to maintain an ongoing, internal relationship with the deceased rather than 'letting go' or seeking total detachment."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key differentiator between 'Burnout' and 'Compassion Fatigue' for the Pet Grief Specialist?",
            "options": ["Burnout is related to the work environment; Compassion Fatigue is related to the absorption of client trauma", "Burnout only happens to new specialists; Compassion Fatigue happens to veterans", "Compassion Fatigue is cured by a vacation; Burnout requires a career change", "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical settings"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Burnout stems from institutional or environmental stressors (long hours, paperwork), while Compassion Fatigue is the 'cost of caring'—the emotional residue of working with those who are suffering."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'The Threshold Effect'—the intense pain felt when walking through the front door where their dog used to greet them. Which L4 intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": ["Advise the client to use the back door for several months", "Suggest placing a symbolic item or a 'transition ritual' at the entry point", "Encourage the client to adopt a new pet to greet them at the door", "Explain that they should ignore the feeling until it eventually fades through habituation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creating a transition ritual or placing a memorial item at the 'threshold' acknowledges the pain of the empty space and provides a constructive way to process the shift in the environment."

            "question": "According to research cited in the module (Nagasawa et al., 2015), oxytocin levels in dog owners can increase by up to what percentage after 30 minutes of eye contact with their pet?",
            "options": ["50%", "100%", "300%", "500%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2015 study found that mutual gazing between dogs and their owners led to a 300% increase in oxytocin levels in the owners, highlighting the biological depth of the human-animal bond."
