            "options": [
                "To help the client forget the pain of the loss as quickly as possible",
                "To transform the narrative of the loss from one of pure trauma to one of enduring significance and purpose",
                "To provide a scientific explanation for the biological causes of the pet's death",
                "To encourage the client to adopt a new pet immediately to fill the void"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meaning-making is about narrative transformation—moving from the 'what' of the loss to the 'so what' of the pet's life and the enduring bond."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 3:1 Ratio is a cognitive tool used to de-center trauma by flooding the neural pathways with positive biographical data to outweigh the traumatic 'snapshot' of the final moments."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
