            "question": "In the context of Narrative Therapy (Lesson 1), what is the primary purpose of 'Externalization' when working with a client experiencing intense 'Pet Owner Guilt'?",
            "options": [
                "To convince the client that they are not responsible for the pet's death",
                "To separate the 'Problem' (Guilt) from the client's identity, viewing it as an external force rather than a character flaw",
                "To encourage the client to blame the veterinary staff instead of themselves",
                "To minimize the emotional impact of the loss through intellectualization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization is a core Narrative Therapy technique that helps clients view their struggles (like guilt) as external entities, allowing them to develop a more objective and self-compassionate relationship with their emotions."

            "question": "According to the 'Peak-End Rule' discussed in Lesson 4, why do many grieving pet owners struggle to remember the years of happy memories with their pet?",
            "options": [
                "The human brain is biologically programmed to forget positive memories during times of stress",
                "The brain prioritizes the most intense moment (Peak) and the final moment (End), which in pet loss are often traumatic",
                "Pet owners typically have poor long-term memory regarding their animals",
                "The 'Peak-End Rule' only applies to physical pain, not emotional grief"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Peak-End Rule is a psychological heuristic where people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and its end, often causing the trauma of the final days to eclipse years of positive experiences."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client is experiencing 'Trauma Loops' where they repeatedly visualize the moment of euthanasia. According to Lesson 3, which neurological state is likely occurring?",
            "options": [
                "Prefrontal Cortex dominance, leading to over-analysis",
                "Hippocampal over-activity, creating too many new memories",
                "An 'Amygdala Hijack' where the brain stays in a state of high alert, preventing the memory from being processed into long-term storage",
                "Vagus Nerve suppression, causing a total lack of emotional response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma loops occur when the amygdala remains hyper-activated, keeping the traumatic memory 'live' and preventing the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex from processing it into a coherent, past-tense narrative."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Moral Injury' is distinguished from 'Standard Guilt' primarily by which of the following factors?",
            "options": [
                "Moral injury is less severe than standard guilt",
                "Moral injury involves a sense of betrayal of one's deeply held core values or 'soul' regarding the care and protection of the pet",
                "Standard guilt only occurs when a mistake was actually made, whereas moral injury is always imagined",
                "Moral injury is a legal term, while guilt is a psychological term"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Moral injury occurs when an individual feels they have violated their own deeply held moral beliefs—such as the duty to protect their pet—leading to a profound sense of soul-wounding that goes beyond simple guilt."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "During a Somatic Reflection session (Lesson 6), a client reports a 'heavy, crushing sensation' in their chest when talking about their pet's last day. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Interoception (sensing internal bodily states)",
                "Proprioception (sensing body position in space)",
                "Exteroception (sensing the external environment)",
                "Dissociation (disconnection from the body)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. In somatic reflection, we help clients identify these internal physical sensations to process the 'body's version' of the grief story."

            "question": "Lesson 7 introduces 'Narrative Anchors.' How do these differ from 'Environmental Triggers'?",
            "options": [
                "Anchors are always negative, while triggers are always positive",
                "Triggers are accidental cues that cause distress; Anchors are intentional, curated cues that ground the client in the 'whole' story of the pet's life",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably",
                "Anchors are only used in clinical settings, while triggers occur in the home"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While triggers are often involuntary and distressing, Narrative Anchors are consciously chosen objects or rituals that help the client reconnect with the full, positive history of their pet rather than just the end."

            "options": [
                "The client no longer feels any sadness when telling the story",
                "The story has a clear temporal order, causal links, and the client has assigned a personal meaning to the events",
                "The client has successfully forgotten the traumatic details of the death",
                "The story is short and avoids all emotional language"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative coherence is achieved when a client can tell the story of their loss with a clear sense of time, cause-and-effect, and most importantly, an integrated meaning that fits into their life story."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client feels intense 'Caretaker Guilt' because they feel they 'gave up' by choosing euthanasia. Which intervention from Lesson 2 helps them process this end-of-life narrative?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Witnessing Stance,' where the specialist helps the client view their actions through the lens of compassion and medical necessity",
                "The 'Distraction Technique,' where the client is told to think about something else",
                "The 'Replacement Strategy,' suggesting the client get a new pet immediately",
                "The 'Avoidance Protocol,' where the specialist skips the details of the death"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Witnessing Stance involves the specialist holding space for the client's story without judgment, helping them reframe their 'betrayal' as an act of final, compassionate stewardship."

            "options": [
                "Narrative reconstruction has no measurable effect on PTSD symptoms",
                "Studies show that structured narrative processing can reduce trauma-related distress by approximately 40-50%",
                "Only 5% of pet owners benefit from narrative therapy",
                "Narrative therapy is only effective if started within 24 hours of the loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research across various trauma contexts, including pet loss, suggests that organizing traumatic memories into a structured narrative significantly reduces PTSD-related symptoms and emotional distress."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 4's 'Life Review,' why is it recommended to focus on 'Ordinary Moments' (e.g., the way a pet slept or a specific daily walk)?",
            "options": [
                "Because extraordinary moments are too painful to remember",
                "To counteract the 'Trauma Overlap' and re-establish the pet's identity as a living being rather than just a 'medical patient'",
                "Because ordinary moments are easier for the specialist to document",
                "To minimize the importance of the pet's death"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on ordinary, daily moments helps break the 'Trauma Overlap'—the tendency for the illness or death to become the pet's entire identity—and restores the full, vibrant history of the relationship."
