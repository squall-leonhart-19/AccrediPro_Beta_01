            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A client is told by a coworker, 'It was just a cat, you can get another one.' This lack of social validation for their loss is a hallmark of which concept?",

            "question": "During the 'Reflective Processing' of a traumatic pet loss, what is the primary goal of deconstructing the narrative?",
            "options": ["To forget the details of the death as quickly as possible", "To move memories from fragmented, intrusive 'hot' spots to a coherent, integrated story", "To assign blame to the veterinarian or responsible party", "To ensure the client never feels sadness when thinking of the pet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective processing helps integrate traumatic, fragmented memories into a coherent narrative, reducing the power of intrusive thoughts and flashbacks."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory hallucinations or 'illusions of presence' are common in pet loss due to the brain's habituation to the pet's physical presence and routine sounds."

            "options": ["Grief is external; Mourning is internal", "Grief is the internal experience; Mourning is the external expression and social ritualization", "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable", "Mourning only occurs if a funeral is held"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grief is the internal emotional state, while mourning is the outward expression or ritualized behavior that helps process that grief."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Continued Bonds Theory suggests that healthily integrating the deceased into one's life through memory and legacy is more effective than 'breaking the bond' or seeking closure through detachment."

            "question": "In managing the 'Physical Void,' why is the 'First 48 Hours' routine adjustment so critical for clients?",
            "options": ["Because the brain's HPA axis is at its lowest activity level", "Because the sudden cessation of caregiving rituals (feeding, walking) creates a 'neurochemical crash'", "Because the client needs to buy a new pet immediately", "Because the client should avoid the house entirely"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The sudden end of caregiving routines causes a sharp drop in dopamine and oxytocin, making the physical absence of the pet feel like a physiological withdrawal."
