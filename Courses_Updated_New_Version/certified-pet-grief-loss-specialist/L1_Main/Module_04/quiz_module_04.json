            "question": "According to the Psychology of Ritual (L1), what is the primary cognitive function of a 'transition ritual' in the context of pet loss?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a distraction from the immediate physical pain of grief",
                "To facilitate the shift of the pet from a 'physical presence' to an 'internalized memory'",
                "To prove to the community that the owner's grief is valid and significant",
                "To ensure the owner reaches the 'Acceptance' stage within 30 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rituals serve as a bridge, helping the brain process the transition from a physical relationship to one based on memory and internal connection, which is vital for long-term healing."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the context of immediate post-loss ceremonies (L2), why is the act of 'washing or grooming' the deceased pet considered a sacred act?",
            "options": [
                "It provides the owner with a sense of agency and 'final caretaking' during a time of helplessness",
                "It is a required hygiene protocol for all home burials",
                "It is the only way to ensure the pet's spirit is released correctly",
                "It shortens the duration of the 'denial' phase of grief"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Grief often involves a feeling of loss of control. Reclaiming the role of 'caretaker' through one final act of grooming provides a sense of agency and honor."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "When designing a personalized memorial service (L3), what is the psychological benefit of incorporating 'sensory anchors' like specific music or scents?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the service more entertaining for guests",
                "It suppresses the emotional response to allow for a more formal ceremony",
                "It bypasses the logical brain to access the limbic system for deeper emotional processing",
                "It is primarily used to cover up unpleasant smells during home services"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory inputs are processed by the limbic system, the seat of emotion and memory, allowing for a more profound and cathartic ritual experience than words alone."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses tangible keepsakes. Which item is specifically recommended for clients experiencing 'searching' behaviors (looking for the pet in the house)?",
            "options": [
                "A digital photo frame with rotating images",
                "A locked wooden urn placed in a closet",
                "A 'comfort item' like a weighted pillow made from the pet's favorite bed",
                "A formal certificate of cremation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Weighted items or textiles that retain the pet's scent provide tactile grounding, which helps soothe the nervous system when a client is reflexively 'searching' for their pet's physical presence."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Regarding digital rituals (L5), what is the primary risk of 'disenfranchised grief' when posting on social media?",
            "options": [
                "The algorithm might stop showing the pet's photos to the owner",
                "Secondary wounding caused by dismissive or 'it was just a dog' comments from the public",
                "Violating the privacy terms of the social media platform",
                "The owner becoming 'addicted' to the likes and comments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because pet loss is often disenfranchised, social media can expose the griever to 'secondary wounding' if their community does not validate the depth of the loss."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "For recurring rituals (L6), how should a specialist advise a client approaching the first 'Gotcha Day' (adoption anniversary) after a loss?",
            "options": [
                "Advise them to ignore the day to avoid triggering a relapse in grief",
                "Suggest they adopt a new pet on that exact day to fill the void",
                "Encourage a 'Proactive Ritual' that honors the pet's life and the joy of their arrival",
                "Tell them that recurring rituals are only for the first year of loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proactive rituals transform a potentially triggering day into a day of meaning-making, focusing on the life lived rather than the death that occurred."

                "Analyzing the biological causes of the pet's death"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children in this age group are concrete thinkers. Physical, creative acts help them process abstract concepts like death and 'forever' in a way they can understand."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Scent is the primary way pets communicate and understand their world. Allowing them to process the scent of the deceased helps them understand the change in the pack dynamic."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Externalized rituals involve taking the love for the pet and 'putting it out' into the world through tangible actions that benefit others or the environment."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client feels guilty about 'moving on' and wants to stop their daily ritual of lighting a candle. What is the specialist's best response?",
            "options": [
                "Tell them they must keep lighting the candle or they will forget the pet",
                "Suggest 'Ritual Evolution'—moving from a daily act to a weekly or milestone-based act",
                "Advise them that they have clearly finished the grieving process",
                "Tell them that rituals are permanent and should never be changed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rituals should evolve as the grief evolves. Moving from a daily ritual to a less frequent one is a healthy sign of integration, not a sign of 'forgetting' or betrayal."
