            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a person's loss is not openly acknowledged, socially validated, or publicly observed, which is common in pet loss where society may view the grief as 'just for an animal.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Restorying aims to integrate the traumatic end-of-life event into a larger, more balanced narrative of the pet's entire life, preventing the trauma from becoming the sole defining feature of the relationship."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
