            "question": "Which neurological structure is primarily responsible for the 'Ghost Habit'—the automatic urge to perform pet-related tasks like checking a water bowl even after the pet is gone?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia governs habit formation and procedural memory; when a pet dies, these neural pathways remain 'wired' for automatic behaviors, creating the jarring 'ghost habit' sensation."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'Shrine Building,' where they refuse to move a single toy or hair from the floor three months later. According to Lesson 3, what is the recommended intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate removal of all items to force acceptance",
                "Encouraging the client to keep the items as-is indefinitely",

                "Hiring a professional organizer to clear the space without the client present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Box and Wait' method allows for incremental desensitization by moving items from the active living space into a box, providing a middle ground between 'erasure' and 'stagnation.'"

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Spatial Grief' is described as which of the following?",

                "The physical sensation of an 'ache' in the specific areas the pet used to occupy",
                "The fear of leaving the house due to social anxiety",
                "The desire to move to a new home to escape memories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spatial grief refers to the somatic and psychological impact of the 'physical void'—the literal empty space in the home where the pet's presence was once constant."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "When managing 'Empty House Syndrome' for solo dwellers (Lesson 5), what is the primary purpose of 'Auditory Fillers'?",

                "To distract the client from their work",
                "To mask the 'deafening silence' that triggers acute loneliness upon entering the home",
                "To train the client to ignore environmental noises",
                "To replace the need for human conversation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Auditory fillers, such as white noise or scheduled podcasts, help mitigate the 'sensory shock' of a quiet home, which can be a major trigger for solo-living grievers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4, why is 'Home Reconfiguration' (moving furniture or changing decor) an effective strategy for integration?",

                "It increases the property value of the home",
                "It provides a physical workout to release endorphins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Changing the visual landscape of the home can interrupt the 'visual loops' where the brain expects to see the pet in a specific chair or corner, facilitating new neural associations."
        },

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'The First 30 Minutes.' Why is this window critical in reconfiguring the daily schedule?",
            "options": [
                "It is the time when cortisol levels are lowest",
                "It is the period most often dominated by 'automatic' pet care routines that now result in a 'void'",
                "It is the best time to check emails",
                "It is the only time of day when grief is not present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The morning routine is often the most heavily 'pet-centric' time of day; reconfiguring this specific window with 'Anchor Rituals' is essential to preventing a daily morning 'grief spike.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scripting allows the griever to acknowledge the loss without being forced into an unwanted, deep conversation, providing a sense of control over public boundaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Comparison Trap' occurs when a griever expects a new pet to 'replace' the unique bond of the previous pet, often leading to resentment or unfair expectations of the new animal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Anchor Ritual keeps the structure of the day intact but modifies the sensory input (new route, audio) to prevent the brain from falling into the 'missing pet' loop."

            "explanation": "Sensory desensitization focuses on the auditory, olfactory, and visual triggers (like the sound of a collar) that cause involuntary emotional flooding."
