                "To help the client forget the traumatic details of the euthanasia",
                "To reduce the cognitive dissonance and intrusive thoughts associated with the loss",
                "To ensure the client can recite the events in chronological order for legal purposes",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative reconstruction aims to organize fragmented traumatic memories into a coherent story, which significantly reduces cognitive dissonance and the frequency of intrusive 'if only' thoughts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Continuing Bonds theory suggests that healthy adaptation to loss involves transforming the relationship into an enduring internal connection rather than severing it."
