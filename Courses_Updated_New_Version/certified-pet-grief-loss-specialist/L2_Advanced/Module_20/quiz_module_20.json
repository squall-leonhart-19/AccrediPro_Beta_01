            "options": [
                "It is too time-consuming for the practitioner",
                "It is prone to confirmation bias and may overlook sub-clinical symptoms",
                "It prevents the practitioner from forming an empathetic bond",
                "It is illegal in most therapeutic jurisdictions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardized tools provide an objective baseline that helps mitigate confirmation bias and ensures that specific dimensions of grief, which might be masked by the client's presentation, are systematically evaluated."

                "The Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale (LAPS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Pet Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ) is modeled after human attachment scales to identify how a client's attachment style (secure, anxious, or avoidant) influences their grieving process."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The PBQ specifically measures three factors: Grief, Social Isolation, and Guilt. While spiritual crisis may occur, it is not a subscale of this specific validated instrument."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fragmentation occurs when the trauma of the loss prevents the brain from processing the event into a linear narrative, leaving the survivor 'stuck' in intrusive sensory memories."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective efficacy is best demonstrated by using the same validated scales (like the PBQ or LAPS) at the start and end of treatment to measure statistically significant changes in symptoms."
