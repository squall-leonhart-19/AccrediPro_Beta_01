            "question": "In the context of 'Sudden Impact' loss (Lesson 1), what is the primary psychological challenge that distinguishes it from terminal illness loss?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of anticipatory grief",
                "The lack of opportunity for 'closure' or final goodbyes",
                "A decrease in the intensity of the bereavement period",
                "The financial burden of long-term veterinary care"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traumatic or accidental loss is characterized by its suddenness, which deprives the owner of the opportunity for anticipatory grief and the chance to say a planned goodbye, often leading to complicated grief."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "Which factor contributes most significantly to the 'social stigma' felt by owners facing Behavioral Euthanasia (Lesson 2)?",
            "options": [
                "The high cost of behavioral modification programs",
                "The age of the animal at the time of the decision",
                "The perception that the owner 'gave up' on a physically healthy animal",
                "The lack of available medications for canine anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Behavioral euthanasia carries a unique stigma because the animal is often physically healthy, leading to external judgment and internal guilt that the owner failed to 'fix' the behavioral issue."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, why is the loss of a 'sole companion' particularly dangerous for senior clients?",
            "options": [
                "Seniors are less likely to seek professional counseling",
                "The pet often served as the primary catalyst for social interaction and daily routine",
                "Senior clients usually have higher levels of financial instability",
                "The physical demands of a new pet are too high for seniors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For many seniors, a sole companion pet is the primary reason for maintaining a schedule and serves as a 'social bridge' to the outside world; losing them can lead to profound isolation."

            "options": [
                "It is too clinical for a child to understand",
                "Children may develop a fear of going to sleep themselves",
                "It implies the pet will eventually wake up",
                "It focuses too much on the medical procedure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developmentally, younger children are literal thinkers. Euphemisms like 'put to sleep' can cause them to associate sleep with death, leading to insomnia or night terrors."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Surviving animals crave stability. Maintaining consistent routines for feeding, walking, and attention helps reduce the stress and anxiety caused by the change in the household hierarchy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "After months or years of intensive caregiving, many owners feel a sense of relief when the burden of care ends at death, which is immediately followed by intense guilt for not 'wanting' the pet to stay longer."
