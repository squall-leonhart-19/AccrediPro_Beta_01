            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'I' in the B.R.I.D.G.E. Framework™ stands for Integration of Narrative, which involves merging the pet's life story and the story of their death into a cohesive, manageable history for the client."

            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Traumatic Loss, what is the primary clinical objective of 'Autonomic Stabilization' before beginning bereavement validation?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to accept the reality of the death",

                "To ensure the client has completed all legal paperwork regarding the pet",
                "To encourage immediate ritual participation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In traumatic loss, validation cannot be processed if the client is in a state of hyper-arousal; stabilization brings them back into the 'window of tolerance' where cognitive processing can occur."

                "It helps the surviving pet track the deceased pet's location in the afterlife",
                "It allows surviving pets to process the scent of 'transition' (death) to reduce searching behaviors",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scent is the primary sensory modality for dogs and cats; allowing them to smell the deceased pet or a blanket used during the transition helps them understand the physical change and reduces 'searching' anxiety."
