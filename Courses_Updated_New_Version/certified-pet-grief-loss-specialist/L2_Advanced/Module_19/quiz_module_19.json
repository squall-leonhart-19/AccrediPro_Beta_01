            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Research into the neurobiology of the human-animal bond indicates that during positive interactions, both humans and dogs experience a significant surge in which hormone, facilitating the 'oxytocin-gaze positive loop'?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Epinephrine",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Nagasawa et al., 2015) demonstrate that mutual gazing between owners and their dogs triggers a reciprocal oxytocin release, mirroring the neurobiological mechanism of the mother-infant bond."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "According to Kenneth Doka's empirical framework on disenfranchised grief, why does pet loss often lead to 'stifled' mourning processes?",
            "options": [
                "Because pet owners lack the capacity for deep emotional attachment.",
                "Because the loss is not socially recognized, validated, or supported by the griever's community.",
                "Because the grieving process for animals is biologically shorter than for humans.",
                "Because there are no legal requirements for pet burial."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a loss cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially supported, which research shows significantly increases the risk of complicated grief."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In comparative studies (Archer, 1997; Gerwolls & Labott, 1994), how did the intensity of grief following a pet's death compare to the loss of a human relative?",
            "options": [
                "Pet loss was consistently rated as significantly less intense than any human loss.",
                "Pet loss was only intense if the owner lived alone.",
                "Grief levels were often comparable in intensity, particularly in dimensions of despair and social isolation.",
                "Human loss was resolved faster than pet loss in 80% of cases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Quantitative research using the Grief Experience Inventory has shown that the psychological impact of pet loss can be just as severe as the loss of a human family member, especially regarding emotional despair."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflective processing through narrative reconstruction helps clients organize traumatic memories into a coherent story, reducing intrusive thoughts and physiological arousal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that rituals provide a structured 'narrative end-point,' helping owners externalize their internal pain and achieve a sense of symbolic closure."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Tedeschi and Calhoun's model of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) identifies five domains. Which domain is most frequently cited in pet loss research when owners transition into animal advocacy or volunteer work?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universality is a core therapeutic factor in group work; for pet owners, hearing others validate the depth of their grief counters the effects of societal disenfranchisement."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meaning-making is the process of integrating the loss into one's self-narrative and finding a way to maintain a symbolic bond with the deceased pet."

            "options": [
                "Focusing 100% of the time on 'loss-oriented' activities (crying, looking at photos)",

                "Suppressing all emotions until one year has passed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model (Stroebe & Schut) emphasizes that healthy grieving involves a dynamic oscillation between processing the loss and attending to life's practical changes."

                "A lack of studies on the loss of common pets like dogs and cats",
                "A lack of longitudinal studies tracking the grief trajectory over several years",
                "Insufficient evidence that people actually love their pets",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While many studies look at the immediate impact of pet loss (0-6 months), there is a significant need for longitudinal research to understand the long-term psychological outcomes and the 'anniversary effect' in pet bereavement."
