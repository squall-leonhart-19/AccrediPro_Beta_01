            "question": "In Lesson 1, the concept of 'Dual Awareness' in EMDR-informed grounding refers to which clinical state?",
            "options": [
                "The client experiencing two different emotions simultaneously.",
                "Maintaining one foot in the present 'safe' environment while acknowledging the traumatic memory.",
                "The practitioner and client sharing the same emotional experience.",
                "Focusing on both the physical and spiritual aspects of the pet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual awareness is a cornerstone of trauma-informed grounding, allowing the client to process traumatic memories without becoming flooded or dissociating by staying anchored in the present moment."

                "Encouraging the client to ignore the sensation until it disappears."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic tracking allows clients to observe physical sensations without judgment, helping to integrate the 'physical void' rather than resisting it, which reduces the distress of phantom sensations."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Advanced Narrative Therapy (Lesson 3) uses 'Externalization' to help clients struggling with guilt. How is this applied in pet loss?",

                "By viewing 'The Guilt' as an external entity trying to obscure the 'Legacy of Love'.",
                "By writing a letter to the pet from the perspective of a stranger.",
                "By moving all the pet's belongings out of the house immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization separates the person from the problem, allowing the client to view guilt as an outside force rather than a core truth of their character or their relationship with the pet."

                "Moral injury is less severe than standard grief.",
                "Moral injury is purely a medical diagnosis that requires hospitalization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Moral injury occurs when a client feels they have violated their own moral code (e.g., the promise to protect the pet), leading to profound shame and spiritual distress."

            "explanation": "Surviving pets often mirror the emotional state of their human caregivers through emotional contagion, which can manifest as physical symptoms of grief."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transpersonal internalization helps clients move toward a 'continuing bond' where the pet's presence is felt internally as a source of comfort and guidance."

            "question": "A client in Lesson 3's case study feels their pet's story 'ended in failure' due to a traumatic emergency room death. What is the 'Re-Authoring' goal?",

                "To convince the client the emergency room visit never happened.",
                "To expand the narrative to include the years of life before the 'final chapter'.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Re-authoring helps the client see that the 'final chapter' (the death) does not define the entire 'book' (the life and bond) of the pet."
