            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Perceive' stage focuses on interoception—the ability to sense the internal state of the body—to identify whether the system is in a ventral, sympathetic, or dorsal state."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the nervous system is responsible for the 'freeze' or 'shutdown' response characterized by bradycardia and hypotension?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC) is the unmyelinated branch of the vagus nerve that mediates immobilization, shutdown, and the freeze response during perceived life threat."

            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Ventral Vagal' baseline but experiences occasional 'glimmers.' In the 'Stabilize' phase, what does a 'glimmer' represent?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is the somatic process of swinging the attention between a 'resource' (safety) and an 'activation' (stress) to help the system integrate small amounts of energy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without a baseline of felt safety (Stabilize), discharging survival energy (Liberate) can overwhelm the system and cause further dysregulation or shutdown."
