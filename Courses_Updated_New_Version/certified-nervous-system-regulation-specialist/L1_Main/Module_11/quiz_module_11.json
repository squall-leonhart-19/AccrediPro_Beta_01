                "To identify the cognitive root of childhood trauma",
                "To complete the sympathetic nervous system's discharge of stored survival energy",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Liberate phase focuses on somatic techniques that allow the body to complete the 'stress response cycle' by discharging stored sympathetic energy (fight/flight) through movement or shaking."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stabilization focuses on anchoring in the Ventral Vagal state, which is reinforced by safe social cues, soft facial expressions, and prosody (melodic tone) in the voice."

            "id": "q11_5",

                "To prove the practitioner's expertise immediately",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Establishing a Ventral Anchor provides a 'safe harbor' for the client, ensuring they have a resource to return to before exploring more challenging triggers or somatic discharges."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners who cannot regulate their own nervous system are at high risk for secondary traumatic stress, where they 'absorb' the dysregulation of their clients."
