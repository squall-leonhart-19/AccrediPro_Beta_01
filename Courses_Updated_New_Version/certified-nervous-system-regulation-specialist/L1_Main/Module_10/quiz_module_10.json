            "question": "According to the evolutionary hierarchy discussed in Lesson 10.1, which neural circuit is the most phylogenetically recent and responsible for social engagement?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC)",
                "The Sympathetic Adrenal Medullary (SAM) Axis",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC)",
                "The Periaqueductal Gray (PAG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the newest evolutionary development in the autonomic nervous system, unique to mammals, and facilitates social bonding, communication, and physiological calm."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, what is the primary objective of the 'Uncover' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To release stored traumatic energy through movement",
                "To identify the specific neuroceptive triggers and 'glimmers' affecting the client",
                "To achieve a state of high-performance flow",
                "To provide clinical diagnosis of autonomic disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Uncover' phase focuses on neuroceptive mapping, helping the client identify the environmental, internal, or relational cues that trigger shifts in their autonomic state."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Lesson 10.3 emphasizes 'Interoceptive Accuracy.' Research indicates that individuals with high interoceptive awareness but low regulatory capacity are most likely to experience:",
            "options": [
                "Enhanced athletic performance",
                "Increased emotional resilience",
                "Heightened anxiety and somatic preoccupation",
                "Spontaneous dorsal vagal shutdown"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While interoception is vital, high sensitivity without the 'Stabilize' skills often leads to being overwhelmed by bodily sensations, manifesting as increased anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "During the 'Liberate' phase (Lesson 10.5), what is the physiological purpose of 'Somatic Discharge'?",
            "options": [
                "To achieve an emotional catharsis through intense crying",
                "To complete the 'thwarted' survival motor patterns trapped in the body",
                "To strengthen the muscular-skeletal system for future threats",
                "To induce a state of hypo-arousal to prevent panic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic discharge (such as trembling or temperature shifts) allows the nervous system to complete the motor patterns of fight or flight that were previously suppressed or frozen."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which mechanism is referred to as the 'Vagal Brake' in Lesson 10.6?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagal Brake refers to the Ventral Vagal Complex's ability to slow the heart rate below its intrinsic pacemaker rhythm, allowing for rapid transitions between calm and mobilization."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 10.7, 'Expanding the Window of Tolerance' is primarily achieved through which physiological process?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing Vagal Tone (HRV)",
                "Maximizing Cortisol production",
                "Prolonged exposure to traumatic triggers",
                "Total avoidance of all sympathetic activation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Expanding the Window of Tolerance is functionally equivalent to improving Vagal Tone, measured by Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which allows the system to handle higher loads of stress without dysregulating."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "A client presents in a 'Dorsal Vagal' state (collapse, numbness, dissociation). According to clinical integration guidelines in Lesson 10.8, what is the most appropriate first step?",
            "options": [
                "Deep, vigorous breathwork to 'shock' the system awake",
                "Gentle sensory grounding and micro-movements to invite safe mobilization",

                "Immediate referral to a psychiatrist for medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is in Dorsal collapse, the goal is 'gentle mobilization.' Moving too fast into high sympathetic activation can cause a re-traumatizing 'bounce' back into shutdown."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "What does 'Neuroceptive Mapping' (Lesson 10.4) reveal about a client's environment?",
            "options": [
                "It identifies only the physical dangers in the room",
                "It categorizes cues into 'Safety' (Glimmers), 'Danger' (Triggers), and 'Life Threat'",
                "It maps the client's genetic predisposition to stress",
                "It determines the client's IQ based on their reaction times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroceptive mapping categorizes environmental and internal cues based on how the subconscious nervous system perceives them: as safe, dangerous, or life-threatening."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "The 'Stabilize' phase (Lesson 10.6) utilizes 'Ventral Vagal Anchors.' Which of the following is an example of a physiological anchor?",
            "options": [
                "Recalling a traumatic memory to 'face it'",
                "Extended exhalations that stimulate the Vagus nerve",
                "Drinking high-caffeine beverages to increase focus",
                "Holding one's breath to increase CO2 levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations (longer than inhalations) stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system via the Vagus nerve, acting as a physiological anchor for the Ventral Vagal state."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "According to the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™ methodology (Lesson 10.2), why must 'Perceive' always come before 'Liberate'?",
            "options": [
                "Because the practitioner needs to bill for the assessment first",
                "Because somatic release without state awareness can lead to accidental re-traumatization",
                "Because 'Liberate' is only for advanced clients",
                "Because 'Perceive' is a purely cognitive exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without the 'Perceive' stage (interoceptive awareness), a client may not recognize when a somatic release is becoming too intense, potentially pushing them out of their window of tolerance and causing re-traumatization."
