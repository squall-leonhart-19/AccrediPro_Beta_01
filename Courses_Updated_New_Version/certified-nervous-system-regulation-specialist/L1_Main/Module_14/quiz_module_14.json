            "question": "Which specific component of the Polyvagal Theory is responsible for the 'Social Engagement System' (SES), regulating the heart, face, and vocal prosody?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC)",
                "The Sympathetic-Adrenal Medullary (SAM) axis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the 'smart' vagus, originating in the Nucleus Ambiguus, and is the physiological foundation of the Social Engagement System."

            "options": [
                "Requires conscious awareness of a threat",
                "Occurs subcortically without conscious awareness",
                "Is only active during Sympathetic arousal",
                "Is a purely cognitive process of risk assessment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is an involuntary, subcortical process that scans the environment and relationships for cues of safety, danger, or life threat without involving the conscious mind."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Feldman’s research found that social synchrony is characterized by the alignment of heart rate variability (HRV) and the reciprocal release of oxytocin."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tronick found that healthy dyads are only 'in sync' about 30% of the time; the resilience of the relationship is built through the process of 'repairing' the frequent ruptures."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The practitioner’s presence is a tool of regulation; by maintaining their own Ventral Vagal state, they provide the cues of safety necessary for the client's neuroception to shift out of defense."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which attachment style is neurologically characterized by 'fright without solution,' where the autonomic nervous system simultaneously activates Sympathetic (fight/flight) and Dorsal (shutdown) states?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment occurs when the caregiver is a source of fear, leading to a biological paradox where the system tries to both approach and flee, resulting in autonomic collapse or fragmentation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural resonance is the process by which individuals in a group influence each other's physiological states through mirror neurons and co-regulatory cues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cranial Nerve V (Trigeminal) and VII (Facial) work together to regulate the middle ear muscles, which filter out low-frequency background noise to focus on human speech."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Avoidant attachment often manifests as a 'functional' Dorsal Vagal state or a 'low-tone' sympathetic state where the individual detaches from relational cues to maintain perceived safety."

            "options": [
                "To tell the client they are making the practitioner anxious",
                "To push through the discomfort to maintain the session's pace",
                "Self-regulation to return to a Ventral Vagal state before continuing",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A practitioner cannot co-regulate a client if they are dysregulated themselves. The 'Use of Self' requires the practitioner to prioritize their own autonomic state to remain a safe anchor."
