            "question": "Which brain region serves as the primary 'hub' for interoceptive awareness, processing internal signals from the heart, gut, and lungs?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Insula",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The insula is the primary cortical site for interoception, integrating physiological signals to create the 'feeling' of the body's internal state."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Neuroception is distinct from perception because it occurs at what level of the nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "The conscious, cognitive level",
                "The muscular, somatic level",
                "The subconscious, pre-cognitive level",
                "The executive functioning level"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroception, a term coined by Dr. Stephen Porges, describes how the nervous system evaluates risk without requiring conscious awareness."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Research on neuroceptive speed suggests that the nervous system can detect a threat cue in approximately how many milliseconds?",
            "options": [
                "20-50 milliseconds",
                "100-200 milliseconds",
                "500-600 milliseconds",
                "Over 1 second"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that the brain processes neuroceptive cues of safety or danger in roughly 100 to 200 milliseconds, far faster than conscious thought."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the context of Relational Neuroception, 'prosody' refers to which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The literal meaning of the words spoken",
                "The physical distance maintained between individuals",

                "The micro-expressions of the lower face"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prosody is the musical quality of the voice. A melodic, varying pitch signals safety (Ventral Vagal), while a monotone or high-pitched voice can signal threat."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client reports that every time they enter a fluorescent-lit office, they feel 'foggy,' 'numb,' and 'disconnected.' This is an example of which autonomic signature?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Activation",
                "Ventral Vagal Engagement",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fogginess, numbness, and disconnection are hallmark physiological markers of the Dorsal Vagal state (immobilization)."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Anatomy of a Trigger' (Lesson 5), what is the primary goal of the 'Uncover' phase for a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately eliminate the trigger",
                "To widen the 'gap' between the cue and the autonomic response",
                "To force the client into a Ventral Vagal state",
                "To ignore the physiological response and focus on logic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By uncovering the specific cues, practitioners help clients create a 'gap' of awareness where they can eventually choose a regulation strategy before the full autonomic response takes over."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which environmental cue is most likely to be neuroceptively processed as a 'predator' sound by the human ear?",
            "options": [
                "Low-frequency rumbling or high-frequency shrieks",
                "Mid-frequency human speech",
                "Rhythmic, melodic music",
                "Consistent white noise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Evolutionarily, low-frequency sounds (like a growl) and high-frequency sounds (like a scream) are processed as danger cues, whereas mid-frequency sounds are associated with social communication."

            "id": "q2_8",

                "Intentional cognitive behavioral exercises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroceptive filters are the 'lenses' through which we view the world, shaped by past experiences that have 'calibrated' the nervous system to expect either safety or threat."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "When using a 'Body Map' tool with a client, the practitioner is primarily attempting to uncover:",

                "The client's cognitive belief system",
                "The somatic location of autonomic energy",

                "The client's muscle mass index"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body mapping is a practitioner tool used to identify where in the body a client feels tension, heat, cold, or numbness during a trigger, helping define their Autonomic Signature."

            "id": "q2_10",

                "Remain in a Ventral Vagal state regardless of triggers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensitivity refers to the intensity of the signal, while accuracy refers to the ability to correctly interpret what that signal means (e.g., mistaking hunger for anxiety)."
