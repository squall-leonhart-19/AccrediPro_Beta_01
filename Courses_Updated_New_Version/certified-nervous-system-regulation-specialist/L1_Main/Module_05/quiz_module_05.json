            "question": "In the context of the 'Expand' phase, how does allostasis differ from homeostasis?",
            "options": [
                "Homeostasis is the process of maintaining stability through change, while allostasis is the return to a fixed set point.",
                "Allostasis is the process of maintaining stability through change, allowing the system to adapt to anticipated demands.",
                "Homeostasis refers only to the nervous system, while allostasis refers to endocrine function.",
                "Allostasis is a state of chronic stress that leads to system failure, whereas homeostasis is always healthy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While homeostasis aims for a fixed equilibrium (set point), allostasis is 'stability through change,' involving the active process of adaptation to environmental demands and the anticipation of future needs."

            "question": "Which neurotrophic factor is often referred to as 'Miracle-Gro for the brain' due to its role in supporting the survival of existing neurons and encouraging the growth of new ones during the expansion phase?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "GABA",
                "BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)",
                "Acetylcholine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) is a key protein that supports neuroplasticity by promoting the growth, maturation, and maintenance of neurons, essential for rewiring the nervous system."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'low vagal tone.' According to the concept of the Vagal Brake, what is occurring physiologically when they transition from a state of rest to sudden movement?",
            "options": [
                "The dorsal vagal complex becomes overactive, causing immediate fainting.",
                "The vagal brake (ventral vagal influence) is released, allowing the sinoatrial node to increase heart rate rapidly.",
                "The sympathetic nervous system is inhibited by the vagus nerve, preventing any increase in heart rate.",
                "The heart rate remains constant due to high levels of parasympathetic saturation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Vagal Brake' refers to the ventral vagal system's ability to slow the heart rate. When we need to mobilize, the brake is released, allowing the heart rate to rise rapidly without requiring a massive sympathetic surge."

            "question": "When working within the 'Stretch Zone' to expand the Window of Tolerance, which technique involves 'dipping' into a challenging sensation for a short period and then returning to a resource or state of safety?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of experiencing small, manageable 'drops' of challenging material or sensations to build capacity without overwhelming the system or triggering a 'snap' out of the window of tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Play is a 'Ventral Vagal + Sympathetic' hybrid state. The Ventral Vagal system provides a container of safety that allows for high-arousal mobilization (Sympathetic) without it devolving into aggression or fear."

            "options": [
                "Eliminate; it refers to removing negative thoughts immediately.",
                "Enrich; it involves staying with a positive experience for 10-30 seconds to strengthen the neural firing.",
                "Evaluate; it involves logically analyzing why a positive experience occurred.",
                "Escalate; it involves increasing the heart rate to maximize dopamine release."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Enriching involves staying with the positive experience, feeling it in the body, and intensifying it. This duration is necessary to transition the experience from short-term memory (firing) to long-term neural structure (wiring)."

                "The point where no stress is present, allowing for maximum recovery.",
                "The point where stress is so high it causes permanent damage (distress).",
                "The 'Goldilocks' zone where a low dose of a stressor (like cold or exercise) triggers an over-compensation and increased resilience.",
                "The state of chronic sympathetic activation that leads to burnout."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormesis is the phenomenon where a low dose of a stressor is beneficial (inducing adaptation and resilience), while a high dose is toxic. The 'Hormetic Zone' is that beneficial window of challenge."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course suggests that Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a reliable proxy for 'Vagal Tone.' Which HRV metric is most commonly used to assess the activity of the parasympathetic 'vagal brake'?",
            "options": [
                "Mean Heart Rate",

                "Cortisol-to-DHEA ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the primary time-domain measure used to estimate vagally-mediated changes in heart rate variability, reflecting the nervous system's ability to self-regulate."

            "question": "Client 'Sarah' experiences a 'snap' into shutdown (Dorsal Vagal) whenever she tries to engage in high-intensity interval training (HIIT). How should a specialist apply the 'Expand' principles here?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage her to 'push through' the shutdown to build mental toughness.",
                "Identify her current threshold and use titration—performing very short bursts of activity followed by ventral vagal recovery.",
                "Switch entirely to restorative yoga and avoid all forms of mobilization.",
                "Prescribe high-dose caffeine to override the dorsal vagal response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To expand the window of tolerance, we use titration. By doing very short, manageable bursts of mobilization followed by intentional 'landing' in safety, we slowly build the system's capacity to handle high arousal without snapping."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which concept describes the nervous system's ability to not just recover from stress, but to actually become stronger and more functional as a result of managed challenges?",
