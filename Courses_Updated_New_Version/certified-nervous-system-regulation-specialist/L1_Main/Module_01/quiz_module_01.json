            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which term, coined by Dr. Stephen Porges, describes the subconscious process by which the nervous system scans for cues of safety, danger, and life-threat without involving the conscious mind?",
            "options": ["Proprioception", "Neuroception", "Interoception", "Exteroception"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the autonomic nervous system's 'surveillance system' that operates below conscious awareness to detect environmental cues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a heart rate of 72 BPM, high heart rate variability (HRV), and the ability to maintain eye contact and prosody in their speech. Which state is most likely dominant?",
            "options": ["Sympathetic Activation", "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown", "Ventral Vagal Safety", "Functional Freeze"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is characterized by physiological stability, social engagement cues (eye contact/prosody), and higher HRV."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In the hierarchy of autonomic responses, which system is evolutionarily the oldest and serves as the 'last resort' for survival?",
            "options": ["The Sympathetic Nervous System", "The Ventral Vagal Complex", "The Myelinated Vagus", "The Dorsal Vagal Complex"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal Complex is the most primitive part of the system, dating back to early vertebrates, used for immobilization and energy conservation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "During Sympathetic activation, which physiological change occurs to facilitate mobilization?",
            "options": ["Increased digestive enzyme production", "Peripheral vasoconstriction and increased heart rate", "Decreased respiratory rate", "Activation of the 'vagal brake'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sympathetic activation increases heart rate and diverts blood flow away from the periphery and digestion toward the large muscles for movement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for processing interoceptive data and is often referred to as the 'heart of the body-brain connection'?",
            "options": ["The Prefrontal Cortex", "The Amygdala", "The Insular Cortex (Insula)", "The Hippocampus"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex integrates internal sensory information (interoception) to create a map of the body's internal state."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When performing the 'Body Scan Protocol' for autonomic awareness, what is the primary objective for the client?",
            "options": ["To judge and fix uncomfortable sensations immediately", "To achieve a state of total relaxation", "To observe and label sensations without immediate interpretation", "To visualize a 'safe place' to escape the body"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal of the Body Scan in the 'Perceive' module is non-judgmental awareness and the identification of physiological data points."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client says, 'I feel like a failure because my chest is tight.' According to Lesson 7, which part of this statement represents the 'Story'?",
            "options": ["The chest tightness", "The feeling of being a failure", "The physical sensation", "The autonomic data"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Story' is the cognitive narrative or interpretation ('I am a failure') applied to the physical 'Sensation' ('chest is tight')."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "What is the clinical purpose of 'Baseline Mapping' in the Perceive phase?",
            "options": ["To diagnose a specific DSM-5 mental health disorder", "To create a personalized profile of how a client's specific nervous system expresses each state", "To force the client into a Ventral Vagal state through willpower", "To compare the client's results to a universal 'normal' average"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Baseline mapping is essential because autonomic expressions are individual; one person's sympathetic state may look like 'cleaning' while another's looks like 'rage'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client in a session appears 'spaced out,' has a slumped posture, reports feeling 'numb,' and has a noticeably slow pulse. Which state are they demonstrating?",
            "options": ["Sympathetic Flight", "Ventral Vagal Connection", "Dorsal Vagal Immobilization", "Sympathetic Fight"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Numbness, dissociation ('spaced out'), and bradycardia (slow pulse) are hallmark indicators of the Dorsal Vagal state."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of an 'Active' interoceptive cue?",
            "options": ["Thinking about a to-do list", "Noticing the texture of the chair against your back", "Feeling the rhythm of your heartbeat while sitting still", "Hearing a loud noise in the hallway"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception refers to internal sensing (heartbeat, breath, hunger), whereas external textures or sounds are exteroceptive cues."
