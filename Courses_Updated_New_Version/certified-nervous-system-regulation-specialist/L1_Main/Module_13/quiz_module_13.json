            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex (specifically the posterior and mid-insula) is the primary site for processing interoceptive data from the body via the Lamina I pathway."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of Neuroception, as defined by Dr. Stephen Porges, how does the nervous system detect threat compared to 'perception'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is a subconscious system for detecting safety, danger, and life-threat that occurs without the need for conscious awareness or cognitive appraisal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Titration involves breaking down intense somatic energy or traumatic memory into small, manageable 'drops' to ensure the client stays within their window of tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal system acts as a 'vagal brake' that slows the heart and allows for social connection, communication, and physiological homeostasis."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, a high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a clinical marker for:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates that the nervous system is responsive and can transition smoothly between states of arousal and rest, reflecting robust vagal tone."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Protocol (Lesson 6), what does the 'S' stand for and what is its primary focus?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' stands for Somatics, where the practitioner tracks the client's non-verbal cues, breath patterns, and physiological shifts to assess their autonomic state."

                "Two nervous systems will always move toward the highest state of arousal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological resonance occurs when the coach's calm, regulated state is detected by the client's neuroception, helping to stabilize the client's physiology."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurogenic tremors are a natural mechanism for the body to discharge excess survival energy and complete the sympathetic motor sequence."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client who experiences 'functional freeze'—moving through life but feeling 'dead inside' or disconnected—is primarily operating from which autonomic state?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
