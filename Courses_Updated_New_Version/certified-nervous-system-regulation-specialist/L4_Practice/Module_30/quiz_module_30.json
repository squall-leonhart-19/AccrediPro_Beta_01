            "question": "A client reveals during a session that they are currently experiencing active suicidal ideation with a specific plan. According to the NSRS™ Scope of Practice (L1), what is the practitioner's immediate responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Attempt to regulate the client's dorsal vagal state using titration techniques.",
                "Immediately refer to emergency services or a qualified mental health professional as this falls outside the NSRS™ scope.",
                "Increase the frequency of coaching sessions to provide more coregulation.",
                "Use the 'Perceive' phase techniques to help the client reframe their thoughts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NSRS™ practitioners are coaches, not therapists. Active suicidal ideation or clinical pathology requires an immediate referral to licensed mental health professionals or emergency services."

            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Niche Mastery), what is the primary neurobiological reason for choosing a 'Coregulatory Audience'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to charge higher prices due to specialization.",
                "It increases the coach's pattern recognition, reducing the cognitive load and 'neuro-complexity' of sessions.",
                "It makes marketing easier because Facebook algorithms prefer narrow niches.",
                "It prevents the coach from ever experiencing secondary traumatic stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specializing in a specific audience allows the coach's nervous system to develop high-level pattern recognition, which reduces the energetic drain of constant novelty and high-stakes coregulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "12 weeks (approx. 90 days) aligns with neuroplasticity research regarding the stabilization of new neural pathways and the 'pruning' of old, maladaptive stress responses."

            "question": "When applying 'Value-Based Pricing' (L4), how should a practitioner calculate the cost of their 12-week program?",
            "options": [
                "By calculating their hourly rate and multiplying it by the number of sessions provided.",
                "By matching the average price of other life coaches in their local geographic area.",
                "By assessing the 'Cost of Chronic Dysregulation' (e.g., lost productivity, medical bills, relationship strain) for the client.",
                "By adding a 20% markup to their monthly business operating expenses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the Return on Investment (ROI) of regulation. The price reflects the value of the transformation (e.g., saving a marriage or career) rather than the hours spent in sessions."

            "options": [
                "Avoids mentioning the client's problems entirely to keep them in a positive state.",
                "Uses 'false scarcity' and 'countdown timers' to trigger a sympathetic drive to buy.",
                "Focuses on creating a neuroception of safety and agency, inviting the client into a regulated state during the sales process.",
                "Relies exclusively on scientific jargon to prove the practitioner's authority."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Traditional marketing often triggers a 'threat response' to drive sales. Ventral-Vagal marketing prioritizes the client's nervous system safety, using transparency and invitation rather than pressure."

                "A specific marketing metric used to track website visitors.",
                "The final stage of the 12-week program where the client perceives their own growth."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Perceive' phase of business systems ensures that every touchpoint (emails, forms, welcome kits) signals safety and organization, beginning the coregulation process before the first meeting."

            "question": "What is a primary 'Social Engagement System' benefit of utilizing Group Containers (L7) for regulation work?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to work fewer hours for the same amount of money.",
                "It provides 'witnessing,' where clients see their own struggles reflected in others, reducing shame and activating Ventral Vagal pathways.",
                "It creates a competitive environment that encourages clients to regulate faster.",
                "It eliminates the need for the practitioner to provide any coregulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group containers leverage the Social Engagement System. Witnessing others' transformations and realizing one is 'not alone' is a powerful regulator that cannot be replicated in 1-on-1 settings."

            "id": "q30_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is a key differentiator between 'Burnout' and 'Secondary Traumatic Stress' (STS)?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is purely physical, while STS is purely psychological.",
                "Burnout is related to workload and environment; STS is the 'cost of caring' and mimics PTSD symptoms from absorbing client trauma.",
                "Burnout only happens to new practitioners; STS only happens to veterans.",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same physiological state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout is often systemic (too many hours, poor pay). STS is specifically the result of coregulating with traumatized nervous systems, leading to symptoms like intrusive thoughts or hypervigilance in the practitioner."

        {
            "id": "q30_9",
            "question": "A practitioner notices they are 'taking the client home with them'—thinking about a client's trauma during dinner and feeling hyper-aroused. This is a sign of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Difficulty 'disconnecting' and experiencing physiological arousal related to a client's story is a hallmark sign of compromised boundaries and the early stages of secondary trauma."

                "10 minutes of personal regulation for every 10 hours of coaching.",
                "Practitioners should only regulate on weekends to maintain professional distance.",
                "A 1:4 ratio (15 minutes of active 'discharge' or regulation for every 60-minute session).",
                "Practitioners do not need extra regulation if they are already 'Ventral-Vagal dominant.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainability requires active 'hygiene' for the nervous system. A common professional standard is allowing 15 minutes of transition/regulation time (discharge) for every hour of high-stakes coregulation."
