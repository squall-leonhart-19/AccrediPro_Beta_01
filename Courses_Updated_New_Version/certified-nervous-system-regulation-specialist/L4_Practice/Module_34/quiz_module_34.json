            "question": "According to Social Baseline Theory discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary neurobiological 'economy' benefit of collective co-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the metabolic cost of individual self-regulation.",
                "The brain perceives social proximity as a bioenergetic resource, lowering the metabolic cost of maintaining homeostasis.",
                "It eliminates the need for the amygdala to scan for threats entirely.",
                "It shifts the group into a permanent state of dorsal vagal immobilization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Baseline Theory posits that the human brain expects access to social relationships to mitigate risk and diminish the level of individual effort needed to regulate the nervous system."

            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™ (Lesson 2), what does the 'U' represent, and why is it critical for curriculum design?",

                "Unfreezing; the process of breaking down old somatic patterns through high-intensity stress.",
                "Undercurrent Tracking; monitoring the unspoken physiological state of the group before introducing new content.",
                "Up-regulation; focusing solely on increasing sympathetic tone for peak performance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Undercurrent Tracking is the practice of reading the 'collective nervous system' to ensure the group is ready for the next level of depth or intensity in the curriculum."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because of neuroceptive contagion, a facilitator acting as a calm, regulated Ventral anchor is the most effective way to signal safety to the group's collective nervous system."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic Liberation refers to the completion of previously 'stuck' or thwarted survival responses (fight/flight) within the safety of the group container."

                "Participants will become bored with the material.",
                "The group may experience 'Somatic Flooding' where the intensity exceeds their current window of tolerance.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Premature expansion occurs when depth or intensity is introduced before the 'Stabilization' phase is complete, leading to dysregulation or flooding rather than growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A rigid, authoritarian 'expert' stance triggers neuroceptive cues of threat/dominance, which can move participants out of their Ventral Vagal 'Social Engagement' system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is essential in group work; providing small, manageable amounts of support helps the participant move out of Freeze without triggering a secondary 'flooding' response."
