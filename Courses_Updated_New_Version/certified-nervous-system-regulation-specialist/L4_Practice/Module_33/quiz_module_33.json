            "question": "A client begins to recount a detailed narrative of childhood sexual abuse during a Vagal toning session. According to the Professional Scope of Practice (L1), what is the most appropriate response?",
            "options": [
                "Listen actively and provide trauma-processing techniques to help them resolve the memory.",
                "Gently redirect the client to their current physiological sensations and provide a referral to a licensed psychotherapist.",
                "Ask the client to pause while you take notes for a diagnostic assessment.",
                "Encourage the client to 'discharge' the energy by screaming or shaking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nervous System Regulation Specialists focus on physiological state-shifting and 'bottom-up' regulation. Processing deep trauma narratives (top-down) is the domain of licensed psychotherapy and falls outside the specialist's scope."

                "The legal requirement to end a session after 60 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic informed consent requires that clients understand they have total autonomy over their body and can withdraw consent for any intervention (especially touch) instantly, regardless of prior agreements."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biometric and physiological data are considered sensitive health information. Compliance requires encryption and the separation of Personal Identifying Information (PII) from raw health data."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FTC and FDA prohibit non-medical professionals from making 'disease claims.' Claiming a product or service 'cures' a diagnosed clinical condition like Depression or PTSD is a major compliance violation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active suicidal ideation with a plan is a crisis that supersedes standard regulation work. Specialists must follow mandatory reporting and crisis protocols to ensure client safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because Vagal stimulation can trigger a state of submissive compliance (fawning), specialists must be hyper-aware of non-verbal cues and use active check-ins to ensure the client isn't just 'going along' while in a state of dorsal shut-down."

            "id": "q33_8",
