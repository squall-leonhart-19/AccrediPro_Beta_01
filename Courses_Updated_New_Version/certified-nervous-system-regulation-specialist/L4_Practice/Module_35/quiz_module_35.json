            "id": "q35_1",
            "question": "When transitioning from 1:1 work to Group Regulation Models (L1), what is the primary neurobiological shift the practitioner must facilitate?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from individual co-regulation to facilitating collective vagal resonance.",
                "Eliminating the need for safety cues to increase group efficiency.",
                "Focusing exclusively on the practitioner's own state without regard for the group.",
                "Replacing all human interaction with pre-recorded audio files."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In group models, the practitioner shifts from being the sole source of co-regulation to facilitating 'collective resonance,' where the group members' nervous systems begin to support and stabilize one another."

            "id": "q35_2",
            "question": "In the context of High-Ticket Immersives and Retreats (L2), why is 'Titration' critical for attendee safety?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures the attendees are pushed into a state of sympathetic flooding for maximum growth.",
                "It allows for the gradual introduction of physiological stressors to prevent Dorsal Vagal shutdown.",
                "It refers to the chemical balance of the water provided at the retreat.",
                "It is a marketing term used to describe the price increase of the event."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves slowing down the processing of traumatic or high-intensity material so the nervous system can integrate the experience without being overwhelmed into a shutdown state."

            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "According to Digital Product Architecture for Vagal Health (L3), what is 'Nervous System Informed UX'?",
            "options": [
                "Using bright, flashing lights to keep the user's attention high.",
                "Creating complex navigation to challenge the user's cognitive functions.",
                "Designing interfaces that minimize cognitive load and prevent sympathetic 'tech-apnea.'",
                "Requiring users to complete tasks under a strict time limit."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nervous System Informed UX focuses on reducing friction and cognitive load, which prevents the user from entering a stress response (or 'tech-apnea') while interacting with digital tools."

            "id": "q35_4",
            "question": "In Corporate Nervous System Consulting (L4), how is 'Value on Investment' (VOI) distinguished from traditional ROI?",
            "options": [
                "VOI measures the direct cash profit from a single workshop.",
                "VOI focuses on qualitative and long-term metrics like employee psychological safety, retention, and reduced presenteeism.",
                "VOI is only used for non-profit organizations.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in regulation science."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While ROI looks at direct financial returns, VOI in a corporate setting looks at the broader impact on organizational health, such as culture, retention, and the reduction of 'presenteeism' (being at work but not productive due to stress)."

            "id": "q35_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, 'Shared Safety' refers to the creation of a team culture where co-regulation is a standard practice, allowing for higher collective performance."

            "id": "q35_6",
            "question": "Ethical Marketing for Specialists (L6) suggests that 'Pain-Point Agitation' is counterproductive because it:",
            "options": [
                "Triggers the prospect's amygdala, potentially leading to a 'threat-based' purchase or avoidance.",
                "Makes the product look too expensive.",
                "Is too difficult for most practitioners to write.",
                "Increases the prefrontal cortex activity, making the prospect too logical."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Agitating pain points triggers a survival response in the amygdala. For a regulation specialist, this is unethical and counter-productive, as it moves the client away from the Ventral Vagal state needed for true healing."

        {
            "id": "q35_7",
            "question": "For the Scaled Practitioner (L7), what is the 'Window of Tolerance' regarding 1:1 client hours before operational efficiency typically declines?",
            "options": [
                "5-10 hours per week",
                "15-20 hours per week",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Most regulation specialists find that exceeding 20-25 hours of direct 1:1 clinical work per week leads to vicarious trauma and burnout, necessitating a shift to scaled models or automated operations."

                "Using only 19th-century psychological theories."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Legacy building involves moving beyond individual sessions to influence the field itself through data, proprietary frameworks (like P.U.L.S.E.™), and advancing the science of regulation."

            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "A practitioner notices that as their group program grows to 100+ members, the 'felt sense' of safety is decreasing. What is the best scaling solution?",
            "options": [
                "Cancel the program and return to 1:1 sessions.",
                "Implement a 'Pod' structure with trained facilitators to maintain micro-communities of co-regulation.",
                "Stop allowing members to speak during sessions.",
                "Increase the price to reduce the number of members."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain safety at scale, practitioners use 'Pods' or small groups led by trained facilitators, ensuring every member still experiences the benefits of close co-regulation."

                "5-10%",
                "15-20%",

                "0%; productivity is unrelated to safety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including Google’s Project Aristotle, show that psychological safety is the #1 predictor of team success, often resulting in productivity and innovation increases of 50% or more compared to high-stress environments."
