            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of severe Major Depressive Disorder and asks for a nervous system protocol to replace their medication. What is the most ethical response for a Regulation Specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest a high-intensity sympathetic activation protocol to counter the depression.",
                "Advise the client to taper off medication while starting the regulation work.",
                "Clarify that regulation work is a complement to, not a replacement for, clinical psychiatric care and stay within scope.",
                "Diagnose the client's state as 'Chronic Dorsal Vagal' and treat the depression directly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regulation Specialists must stay within their scope of practice, which involves supporting autonomic health rather than diagnosing or treating clinical mental health disorders or managing pharmaceutical protocols."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "In somatic and autonomic work, why is 'Informed Consent' considered a dynamic rather than a one-time process?",
            "options": [
                "Because clients often forget what they signed at the beginning of the session.",
                "Because the nervous system's neuroception of safety can change in real-time during somatic interventions.",
                "Because legal regulations require a new signature every 15 minutes.",
                "Because practitioners need to protect themselves from malpractice lawsuits."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autonomic states shift during sessions. An intervention that felt safe at the start may trigger a threat response later, requiring the practitioner to check in and renew consent dynamically."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal-informed ethics, what is the 'Biological Imperative' of the practitioner in the session?",
            "options": [
                "To remain completely neutral and stoic regardless of the client's state.",
                "To use their own regulated Ventral Vagal state as a 'beacon' for the client's co-regulation.",
                "To dominate the space to ensure the client feels 'protected'.",
                "To ensure the client reaches a state of high sympathetic arousal in every session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The practitioner’s state is the primary intervention. Ethically, the practitioner must maintain a regulated Ventral Vagal presence to facilitate the client's neuroception of safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "An ethical practitioner observes a client beginning to 'flood' (overwhelming emotional/autonomic discharge). What is the ethical priority in titration?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to 'push through' to achieve a cathartic release.",
                "Continuing the protocol as planned to maintain consistency.",
                "Immediately pausing and using grounding techniques to bring the client back to their window of tolerance.",
                "Asking the client to analyze why they are feeling overwhelmed while they are still in the state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical pacing requires titration—breaking down experiences into manageable pieces. If a client is flooding, the practitioner must prioritize regulation over 'catharsis' to avoid re-traumatization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "How does 'Cultural Humility' apply to autonomic diversity in regulation work?",
            "options": [
                "By assuming that all human nervous systems respond to the same 'safety' cues identically.",
                "By recognizing that systemic oppression and historical trauma can create a baseline of 'functional freeze' or hypervigilance as a survival strategy.",
                "By teaching clients that their cultural background is irrelevant to their Vagus nerve function.",
                "By prioritizing Western models of 'calm' as the only valid goal for regulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility involves acknowledging that what 'safety' looks like varies. For many, hypervigilance is a protective, adaptive response to systemic environments, not just a biological 'malfunction'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "When working with proximity and somatic boundaries, what is the 'Ethical Buffer Zone'?",
            "options": [
                "A physical distance of exactly six feet maintained at all times.",
                "The distance at which a client's nervous system begins to signal a neuroception of threat or intrusion.",
                "The legal boundary between a practitioner's office and the waiting room.",
                "A psychological barrier where the practitioner ignores the client's body language."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ethical buffer zone is the relational space where the practitioner respects the client's autonomic boundaries, adjusting proximity based on the client's non-verbal cues and neuroception."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "What is a unique ethical challenge of 'Digital Regulation' (working over Zoom or video calls)?",
            "options": [
                "The inability to use any regulation techniques effectively.",
                "The 'disembodiment' effect and the loss of subtle micro-expressions and co-regulatory resonance.",
                "The fact that digital work is generally considered more effective than in-person work.",
                "There are no ethical challenges specific to digital work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital work can dampen the cues of safety (prosody, micro-expressions) and makes it harder for the practitioner to intervene if a client goes into a severe dissociative or dorsal state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Why is practitioner self-care categorized as an 'Ethical Imperative' rather than just a personal choice?",
            "options": [
                "Because practitioners get paid more if they are well-rested.",
                "Because a dysregulated practitioner cannot provide the co-regulatory cues necessary for client safety, potentially causing harm.",
                "Because the certification requires 50 hours of self-care per year.",
                "Because it is a legal requirement in most states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In regulation work, the practitioner's nervous system is the tool. A 'burnt out' or dysregulated practitioner transmits cues of threat or instability, which is an ethical failure in a co-regulatory relationship."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client shares a history of trauma that falls outside of your training as a Regulation Specialist. What is the ethical 'Warm Handoff' procedure?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop working with the client and tell them you can't help.",
                "Continue the regulation work but try to act as their therapist as well.",
                "Acknowledge the limits of your scope and provide a referral to a trauma-informed therapist while offering to collaborate on the regulation aspect.",
                "Ignore the trauma and focus only on the breathing exercises."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An ethical 'warm handoff' involves acknowledging scope limits while ensuring the client isn't abandoned, typically by referring to a qualified clinician while maintaining the regulation-specific support."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Autonomic Consent' during a session?",
            "options": [
                "The client signing a paper form before the session begins.",
                "The practitioner interpreting the client's physiological cues (like bracing or breath-holding) as a 'No,' even if the client says 'Yes'.",
                "The practitioner forcing a technique because they know it will help the client eventually.",
                "Asking the client's permission only once at the beginning of the year."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autonomic consent involves the practitioner being attuned to the client's body. If the body shows signs of 'bracing' or 'withdrawal,' the practitioner should pause and check in, as the nervous system is communicating a lack of safety."
