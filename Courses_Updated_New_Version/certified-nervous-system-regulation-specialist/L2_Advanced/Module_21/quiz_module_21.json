            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Treatment Planning,' why must the Stabilization phase precede the Liberation phase?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client has enough cognitive understanding of their trauma",
                "To build sufficient autonomic capacity to process 'stuck' energy without re-traumatization",
                "To complete all necessary insurance and professional documentation first",
                "To ensure the client can achieve a state of permanent relaxation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization builds the 'vessel' (autonomic capacity) necessary to hold the high-intensity energy released during the Liberation phase, preventing the system from flooding or dissociating."

            "question": "During the 'Perceive' phase of Advanced Baseline Mapping, which physiological marker is considered the most reliable indicator of 'Vagal Brake' efficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Resting Heart Rate (RHR)",
                "Blood Pressure variability",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Respiratory Rate at rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV is the gold standard for measuring the efficiency of the myelinated ventral vagal brake and the system's ability to transition between states of mobilization and social engagement."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "An 'Environmental Audit' in the Uncover Phase primarily seeks to identify:",
            "options": [
                "The client's childhood relationship with their parents",
                "External 'Cues of Danger' (mis-tuned neuroception) within the client's daily surroundings",
                "The specific nutritional deficiencies causing nervous system dysregulation",
                "The client's career goals and financial stability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental audits focus on the 'Uncover' phase to identify external triggers and 'cues of danger' that keep the client's neuroception in a state of high alert."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When designing a 'Somatic Sequence' for a client in a chronic Dorsal Vagal (shutdown) state, what is the recommended starting point?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training to shock the system",
                "Deep cognitive processing of the original trauma",
                "Micro-movements and 'passive mobilization' to gently signal safety to the brainstem",
                "Complete sensory deprivation to rest the system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Dorsal states, the system requires very small, gentle 'micro-inputs' or passive mobilization to avoid triggering a sympathetic spike that could lead back into shutdown."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "In Stabilization Protocols, what is the primary function of an 'Autonomic Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from feeling any physical pain",
                "To provide a reliable, internal 'home base' of safety the client can return to when dysregulated",
                "To force the client to stay in a sympathetic state for longer periods",
                "To replace the need for professional therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Autonomic Anchor is a specific somatic resource (a sensation, breath, or visualization) that the client can use to return to a state of regulated safety."

            "options": [
                "Only 10% of clients will successfully expand their window",
                "Clients should only spend 10% of their day in a regulated state",
                "Incremental challenges to the nervous system should only exceed current capacity by roughly 10% to ensure integration",
                "The practitioner should take a 10% commission on all treatment plans"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 10% rule is a dosing logic principle that suggests autonomic challenges should be incremental (roughly 10% beyond current capacity) to facilitate growth without causing a system crash."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "A practitioner guides a client to notice a tight sensation in their chest, then shift focus to the feeling of their feet on the floor, alternating between the two. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Titration",

                "Cognitive Reframing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is the process of swinging the focus between a point of activation (the chest) and a point of resource/safety (the feet) to help the system process stress."

            "id": "q21_8",

                "Breaking down a traumatic memory or sensation into the smallest, most manageable 'drops' of experience",
                "The process of increasing the dosage of herbal supplements",
                "Measuring the exact amount of sweat produced during a sympathetic spike",
                "The speed at which a client speaks during a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Titration comes from chemistry; in somatic work, it refers to slowing down and breaking experiences into tiny 'drops' so the nervous system can digest them without becoming overwhelmed."

            "options": [
                "The client's literal words and stories",
                "The practitioner's personal feelings about the client",
                "Observed shifts in skin color, breath rate, muscle tone, and prosody",
                "The client's attendance record and payment history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional documentation for regulation specialists must include objective autonomic markers like changes in prosody, respiratory patterns, and vasomotor responses (skin color/temperature)."

            "options": [
                "Aggressive exercise followed by cold plunges",
                "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address her thoughts first",
                "Titrated mobilization (gentle movement) followed by anchoring in Ventral Vagal safety",
                "Immediate deep tissue massage to release all muscle tension at once"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional Freeze requires 'thawing' the system through very small, titrated movements (mobilization) while simultaneously providing strong anchors of safety to prevent a full sympathetic panic attack."
