            "question": "A high-level executive presents with 'unexplained' exhaustion despite high productivity. They describe feeling like they are 'operating on autopilot' and feel disconnected from their family. Which state of the nervous system most likely characterizes this 'Functional Freeze'?",
            "options": [
                "Acute Sympathetic Arousal",
                "High-Tone Dorsal Vagal (Functional Freeze)",
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "Low-Tone Sympathetic Dominance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional freeze is a high-tone dorsal vagal state where the individual remains productive and 'functional' in high-performance environments while being physiologically dissociated and emotionally numb."

        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the case study of first responders (Lesson 2), what is the primary physiological challenge when transitioning from 'on-call' to 'off-duty' status?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate transition into Dorsal Vagal collapse",
                "Inability to down-regulate from Sympathetic Dominance due to chronic hyper-vigilance",
                "Excessive Ventral Vagal activation leading to social fatigue",
                "Rapid depletion of cortisol leading to immediate sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "First responders often experience 'sympathetic dominance,' where the nervous system remains stuck in a state of hyper-vigilance, making it difficult to access the 'rest and digest' state even when safe."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "Which behavior is most indicative of a 'Fawn' response in a client navigating relational trauma?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive confrontation when boundaries are crossed",
                "Complete withdrawal and silence during conflict",
                "Hyper-attunement to the practitioner's needs and reflexive 'people-pleasing' to ensure safety",
                "Physical shaking and trembling during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response is a survival strategy involving the abdication of personal boundaries and hyper-attunement to others' needs to prevent conflict or harm."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "When tailoring the P.U.L.S.E. Framework for neurodivergent clients (Lesson 4), what is the first priority in the 'P' (Presence/Preparation) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging deep eye contact to build rapport",
                "Reducing sensory triggers and establishing environmental predictability",

                "Using complex metaphors to explain nervous system states"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For neurodivergent clients, sensory processing is foundational. Reducing triggers and ensuring environmental safety is the critical first step in the P.U.L.S.E. framework."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A client with chronic illness reports 'bracing' their body whenever they enter a medical office, leading to a flare-up of symptoms. This 'Somatic Bracing' is a hallmark of:",
            "options": [
                "Malingering or attention-seeking behavior",
                "A purely muscular issue unrelated to the nervous system",
                "Anticipatory medical trauma and autonomic 'guarding' for protection",
                "Ventral Vagal over-activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic bracing is a protective autonomic response where the body 'guards' against perceived threat, common in those with histories of medical trauma or chronic illness."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses Post-Partum Dysregulation. Research indicates that maternal vagal tone is a significant predictor of:",
            "options": [
                "The infant's ability to self-regulate and develop healthy co-regulation patterns",
                "The speed of physical recovery from labor only",
                "The infant's birth weight",
                "The mother's preference for breastfeeding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Maternal vagal tone is critical for co-regulation; a mother's ability to access a Ventral Vagal state directly influences the infant's developing nervous system regulation."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In cases of Developmental Trauma and Disorganized Attachment (Lesson 7), the client often experiences a 'fear without solution' because:",
            "options": [
                "They have no memory of the trauma",
                "The caregiver is simultaneously the source of fear and the only source of safety",
                "The sympathetic nervous system has completely shut down",
                "They lack the cognitive ability to process emotions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment arises when the person the child turns to for safety is also the person causing the fear, creating an unsolvable biological paradox."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When addressing Collective Trauma (Lesson 8), which intervention is most effective for community-level regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Individual-only isolation therapy",
                "Shared somatic rituals and the creation of safe, 'witnessed' community spaces",
                "Ignoring the cultural context to focus on 'pure' biology",
                "Prescribing pharmacological interventions to the entire group"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collective trauma requires collective solutions; shared rituals and communal witnessing help move a community from collective dorsal vagal (numbness) back into social engagement."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client who is a 'fawner' (Lesson 3) often struggles with 'Interoceptive Blindness.' This means they:",
            "options": [
                "Cannot see objects in their peripheral vision",
                "Are unable to feel their own internal bodily sensations because they are focused on others",
                "Have a high tolerance for spicy foods",
                "Are hyper-aware of their own heart rate at all times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive blindness in fawning occurs because the individual’s 'neuroception' is directed outward to scan for threats in others, leading to a disconnection from their own internal state."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key differentiator between 'Burnout' and 'Functional Freeze' as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is always more severe than Functional Freeze",
                "Functional Freeze involves high productivity despite internal collapse; Burnout usually involves a total inability to perform",
                "Burnout is a Ventral Vagal state, while Freeze is Sympathetic",
                "There is no difference; the terms are synonymous"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout often leads to a cessation of work, Functional Freeze is characterized by the ability to keep 'performing' and 'doing' while being physiologically and emotionally checked out."
