            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "During an acute crisis, the 'Top-Down' regulatory capacity of the brain is often compromised. Which neurobiological phenomenon describes the functional disconnection of the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) during high-arousal states?",
            "options": [
                "Neuroplastic pruning",
                "Transient Hypofrontality",
                "Amygdala Hypertrophy",
                "Vagal Brake Activation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transient Hypofrontality occurs when the Prefrontal Cortex 'goes offline' during a crisis, shifting control to the limbic system and brainstem for survival, which limits the client's ability to use logic or cognitive coping strategies."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Rapid Assessment framework used for triage, what does the 'U' represent?",
            "options": [
                "Unconscious Bias",
                "Underlying Medical Conditions",
                "Urgency of Intervention",
                "Understanding the Narrative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the P.U.L.S.E. framework (Presence, Urgency, Level of Arousal, Safety, Environment), 'Urgency' determines if the client requires immediate emergency medical/psychiatric intervention or if somatic stabilization can proceed."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) is distinguished from standard PTSD by the presence of 'Disturbances in Self-Organization' (DSO). Which of the following is a core component of DSO?",
            "options": [
                "Flashbacks to a single event",
                "Affect dysregulation and persistent negative self-concept",
                "Auditory hallucinations",
                "Avoidance of specific external reminders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "C-PTSD includes the three core PTSD symptoms plus DSO symptoms: affect dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal disturbances, typically resulting from prolonged, repeated trauma."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "According to the Theory of Structural Dissociation, 'Secondary Dissociation' is characterized by which internal configuration?",
            "options": [
                "One Apparently Normal Part (ANP) and one Emotional Part (EP)",
                "Multiple Apparently Normal Parts (ANPs) and multiple Emotional Parts (EPs)",
                "One Apparently Normal Part (ANP) and two or more Emotional Parts (EPs)",
                "The complete absence of an Apparently Normal Part (ANP)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary dissociation involves one ANP (handling daily life) and multiple EPs (carrying different traumatic memories or defensive responses), often seen in C-PTSD and OSDD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A client in a high-arousal sympathetic state presents with rapid breathing, dilated pupils, and motor restlessness. Which somatic de-escalation technique is most appropriate for discharging this 'trapped' energy?",
            "options": [
                "Deep guided meditation and stillness",
                "Wall pushes or isometric resistance",
                "Recounting the details of the traumatic event",
                "Lying down in a darkened room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For high-arousal sympathetic states, isometric resistance (like wall pushes) allows the system to complete the 'fight' circuit and discharge motor energy safely without increasing global arousal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "Research into somatic comorbidities shows that chronic activation of the Dorsal Vagal complex is frequently associated with which medical condition?",
            "options": [
                "Acute Hypertension",
                "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) with constipation dominance",

                "Tachycardia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal complex regulates sub-diaphragmatic organs; chronic 'freeze' or shutdown states are highly correlated with digestive issues like IBS and gastroparesis."

        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "When working with complex cases, what is the 'Red Line' in a practitioner's scope of practice regarding risk management?",

                "Working with a client who experiences occasional dissociation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active suicidal ideation with plan and intent is a clinical emergency that exceeds the scope of a somatic practitioner and requires immediate referral to emergency services or a crisis team."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "The 'Practitioner’s System' requires sustainability. What is the primary difference between 'Burnout' and 'Vicarious Trauma'?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is sudden; Vicarious Trauma is gradual",
                "Burnout is related to workplace volume/stress; Vicarious Trauma is a shift in the practitioner’s world view due to client trauma",
                "There is no difference; they are the same concept",
                "Burnout only affects medical doctors; Vicarious Trauma only affects therapists"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout is generally related to workload and environment, while Vicarious Trauma specifically refers to the transformation in the practitioner's inner experience resulting from empathetic engagement with trauma survivors."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client suddenly 'spaces out,' becomes unresponsive to their name, and their skin becomes pale and cool. What is the most likely state and the appropriate somatic response?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-arousal; use vigorous movement",
                "Hypo-arousal (Dorsal Vagal Shutdown); use gentle sensory orienting like smelling a strong scent or touching a textured object",
                "Social Engagement; encourage more talking",
                "Sympathetic Flight; encourage the client to run in place"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client is showing signs of Dorsal Vagal shutdown (dissociation). Gentle, non-invasive sensory orienting helps bring the system back into the Window of Tolerance without over-stimulating it."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "Statistics from the CDC-Kaiser ACE Study indicate that individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher are approximately how much more likely to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than those with a score of 0?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 times",
                "2 times",
                "3.9 times",
                "10 times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ACE study found that high levels of childhood adversity (ACE 4+) correlated with a 390% (3.9x) increase in the risk of COPD, illustrating the profound link between nervous system trauma and physical health."
