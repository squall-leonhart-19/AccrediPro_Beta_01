            "question": "In the context of NSR supervision, what is the primary distinction between 'Administrative Supervision' and 'Clinical Mentorship'?",
            "options": [
                "Administrative focuses on billing, while mentorship focuses exclusively on the practitioner's personal trauma history.",
                "Administrative focuses on organizational compliance, while mentorship focuses on the refinement of somatic interventions and practitioner presence.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms are used interchangeably in the AccrediPro framework.",
                "Administrative supervision is mandatory for licensure, whereas mentorship is only for business development."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Administrative supervision deals with logistics and compliance, whereas Clinical Mentorship in NSR focuses on the 'art and science' of somatic work, including intervention precision and the practitioner's self-regulation."

            "question": "During a P.U.L.S.E. Audit™, the 'S' stands for 'Somatic Sequencing.' What is the supervisor evaluating during this phase of the audit?",
            "options": [
                "The supervisor's own heart rate variability during the session.",
                "The practitioner's ability to guide the client through a logical progression of physiological states without premature catharsis.",
                "The chronological order of the client's developmental trauma history.",
                "The specific sequence of billing codes used for insurance reimbursement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Sequencing evaluates whether the practitioner is moving the client through the 'Liberate' and 'Integrate' phases in a way that respects the nervous system's capacity, avoiding 'flooding' or 'bypassing.'"

        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "A supervisor notices they are feeling a distinct sense of 'heaviness' and 'immobility' in their own legs while listening to a mentee describe a client stuck in a functional freeze. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "A boundary violation.",
                "Vicarious traumatization.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Countertransference is the supervisor's bodily response to the practitioner's narrative or the 'field' created between the practitioner and client, often mirroring the client's physiological state."

        {
            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Parallel Process' concept discussed in Lesson 3, if a practitioner is feeling 'rushed' and 'anxious' to fix a client, how is this most likely to manifest in the supervision session?",
            "options": [
                "The client will suddenly recover without intervention.",
                "The supervisor will feel a reciprocal urge to provide 'quick fixes' and rapid-fire advice to the practitioner.",
                "The practitioner will become hyper-regulated and calm.",
                "The supervision session will naturally slow down to a meditative pace."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel process suggests that the dynamics between the client and practitioner are often recreated between the practitioner and supervisor. A rushed practitioner often triggers a 'rushed' supervisor."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "When mentoring a practitioner through the 'Liberate' phase (Lesson 4), what is the 'Gold Standard' for somatic precision regarding titration?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to discharge as much energy as possible in the first session.",
                "Ensuring the practitioner can identify the 'micro-moment' of sympathetic activation before it crosses the threshold into high-tone dorsal collapse.",
                "Moving directly into cognitive reframing to bypass the body's bracing patterns.",
                "Focusing exclusively on positive resources and avoiding all traumatic material."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Precision in the Liberate phase requires the practitioner to catch subtle physiological shifts (micro-moments) to ensure the 'discharge' is titrated and doesn't overwhelm the system."

            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "In Group Supervision Models, what is the primary benefit of 'Collective Regulation'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the supervisor to take a break while the group talks.",
                "It reduces the financial cost of supervision for the participants.",
                "It creates a 'larger container' that can hold higher-intensity traumatic material through the co-regulation of multiple regulated nervous systems.",
                "It ensures that everyone in the group has the exact same opinion on a case."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collective regulation leverages the group's combined 'Window of Tolerance' to process difficult cases that might feel overwhelming to a single practitioner in isolation."

            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Scope of Practice.' When should a supervisor transition from 'mentoring' to 'recommending therapy' for a mentee?",
            "options": [
                "Whenever the mentee disagrees with the supervisor's clinical approach.",
                "When the mentee's personal trauma history is consistently being triggered, preventing them from maintaining a 'Regulated Presence' (The P in P.U.L.S.E.).",
                "Only if the mentee explicitly asks for a therapist recommendation.",
                "After the mentee has completed 100 hours of supervision."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervision is not therapy. If a practitioner's own 'unhealed' nervous system patterns consistently interfere with their clinical efficacy, the supervisor must ethically direct them to personal therapeutic support."

            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "What characterizes the 'Expand' phase for a mentee (Lesson 7) in the journey toward mastery?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner stops using all NSR protocols and creates their own.",
                "The practitioner moves from 'procedural fluency' to 'intuitive integration,' where they can adapt interventions in real-time based on subtle field shifts.",
                "The practitioner focuses solely on increasing their client volume to maximize revenue.",
                "The practitioner begins to ignore the client's physiological cues in favor of psychological theory."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Expand' phase is about moving beyond rigid adherence to steps and into a state of 'flow' and 'mastery' where the work becomes an intuitive, embodied response to the client's needs."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that practitioners who received regular somatic-focused supervision showed a ____% increase in client retention compared to those without supervision.",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "22%",
                "34%",
                "58%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistent, high-quality supervision is strongly correlated with higher client retention (34%) because the practitioner remains regulated and prevents the 'burnout' that leads to premature termination."

            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the most critical ethical consideration when building a 'Business of Mentorship'?",
            "options": [
                "Charging the highest possible market rate to establish authority.",
                "Ensuring that the 'Power Differential' is acknowledged and that the mentor does not exploit the mentee's professional vulnerability.",
                "Only mentoring practitioners who work in the same geographic area.",
                "Requiring mentees to sign a non-compete agreement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leadership in the field requires a high degree of ethical integrity, specifically managing the power dynamic inherent in the mentor-mentee relationship to ensure it remains a space of growth rather than exploitation."
