            "question": "In Advanced Somatic Tracking, what is the primary purpose of 'Dual Awareness'?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from painful memories by focusing on external objects.",
                "To maintain simultaneous awareness of internal somatic sensations and the safety of the current environment.",
                "To force the client to choose between feeling their body and seeing the room.",
                "To induce a trance-like state where the client forgets their physical surroundings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual Awareness allows the client to process internal sensations while staying tethered to the 'here and now' safety of the environment, preventing flooding or dissociation."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "When working with Complex Trauma (C-PTSD), why is 'Micro-Titration' preferred over standard titration?",
            "options": [
                "Because C-PTSD clients have a much wider Window of Tolerance.",
                "It allows the practitioner to complete the session faster.",
                "C-PTSD nervous systems often have a 'hair-trigger' response where even small amounts of activation can lead to total flooding.",
                "Micro-titration is only used for physical injuries, not emotional trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-titration breaks down traumatic activation into the smallest possible 'bits' to ensure the nervous system can integrate the experience without being overwhelmed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes a 'Sub-Threshold Trigger' in Neuroceptive Mapping?",
            "options": [
                "A conscious thought that causes immediate panic.",
                "A subtle environmental or internal cue that triggers a shift in the autonomic state before the client is consciously aware of it.",
                "A major life event like a car accident or job loss.",
                "A trigger that is so loud it causes physical pain in the ears."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sub-threshold triggers operate at the level of neuroception—the 'below-conscious' scanning for safety and danger—affecting the state before the mind labels the feeling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Autonomic Contagion,' how does a practitioner use their own nervous system as an intervention?",
            "options": [
                "By matching the client's high-arousal state to show empathy.",
                "By remaining in a state of Dorsal Vagal shutdown to appear calm.",
                "By maintaining a regulated Ventral Vagal state to offer a 'biological anchor' for the client's system to mirror.",
                "By ignoring their own physiological responses to focus entirely on the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Through co-regulation, the practitioner's regulated Ventral Vagal state can help 'soothe' the client's dysregulated system via the Social Engagement System."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "When integrating Polyvagal Theory with Internal Family Systems (IFS), which 'part' is most commonly associated with a reactive Dorsal Vagal (shutdown) response?",
            "options": [
                "The Manager",
                "The Firefighter",
                "The Self",
                "The Exiled Child"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Firefighters often use 'extreme' measures like dissociation, numbing, or shutdown (Dorsal Vagal) to douse the 'flames' of intense emotional pain from Exiles."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "High-Performance Vagal Tone is not just about relaxation; it is specifically measured by:",
            "options": [
                "The ability to stay in a calm state regardless of the situation.",
                "The speed and efficiency with which the 'Vagal Brake' can be re-engaged after a sympathetic challenge.",
                "Having the lowest possible resting heart rate.",
                "The total absence of any sympathetic nervous system activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True vagal tone is reflected in 'autonomic flexibility'—the ability to move into high energy and return to a calm state quickly and smoothly."

        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "In Somatic Ethics, why is the 'Power Dynamic' more pronounced than in traditional talk therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Because somatic practitioners have more medical training.",
                "Because working with the body and touch (if applicable) can trigger deep-seated primal vulnerabilities and transference.",
                "Because clients are usually required to lie down during sessions.",
                "There is no difference in power dynamics between somatic and talk therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The physiological nature of somatic work can bypass cognitive defenses, making the client feel more vulnerable and increasing the practitioner's ethical responsibility."

        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Clinical Case Formulation, what does the 'E' stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Elimination of all stress",
                "Emergency Intervention",
                "Expansion of the Window of Tolerance",
                "Externalization of Trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The final stage of the P.U.L.S.E. protocol (Presence, Underpinning, Leveling, Stabilization, Expansion) focuses on proactively expanding the client's capacity for joy, intimacy, and resilience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'functional disconnection'—they report feeling 'fine' and 'numb,' but their heart rate is 110 bpm and their breathing is shallow. According to Module 24, this is likely:",
            "options": [
                "A pure Ventral Vagal state.",
                "A 'High-Tone Dorsal' or 'Freeze' state where sympathetic arousal is trapped under a layer of shutdown.",
                "A sign that the client is lying about their feelings.",
                "A healthy state of athletic readiness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Freeze is a 'mixed state' where high sympathetic activation (tachycardia) is present, but the system has 'slammed on the brakes' with Dorsal Vagal shutdown, leading to numbness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "According to the research cited in Lesson 6, what percentage of 'Ventral Vagal' capacity is typically built during proactive expansion versus reactive crisis management?",
            "options": [
                "10% proactive / 90% reactive",
                "50% proactive / 50% reactive",
                "80% proactive / 20% reactive",
                "95% proactive / 5% reactive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners focus on 'Expansion' (proactive work) because approximately 80% of long-term neural plasticity occurs when the system is in a regulated, safe state rather than in acute crisis."
