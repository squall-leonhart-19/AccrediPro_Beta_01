            "question": "A 6-year-old Labrador Retriever presents with chronic vomiting, diarrhea, and significant weight loss, diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) refractory to initial treatments. Which advanced nutritional strategy is most likely to be recommended to manage this case, considering a goal of reducing inflammation and promoting gut healing?",
            "options": [
                "A high-fiber, low-fat diet to promote satiety and gut motility.",
                "A novel protein or hydrolyzed protein diet with highly digestible carbohydrates and moderate fat.",
                "A grain-free diet rich in legumes and root vegetables.",
                "A raw, high-fat diet to provide dense energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Novel or hydrolyzed protein diets minimize antigenic stimulation, which is crucial in IBD. Highly digestible ingredients reduce the workload on the compromised GI tract, while moderate fat provides energy without exacerbating steatorrhea common in malabsorption. This approach aligns with evidence-based strategies for managing chronic enteropathies."

            "question": "A client with a dog diagnosed with both early-stage Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is seeking dietary advice. Which challenge is most prominent when attempting to formulate a single diet to manage both conditions, and what is a common compromise?",
            "options": [
                "CKD requires controlled, high-quality protein, while IBD often benefits from novel or hydrolyzed protein, making protein source selection difficult.",
                "CKD requires phosphorus restriction, while IBD requires high fiber, which can be difficult to combine.",
                "CKD diets are typically high fat, while IBD diets need to be low fat.",
                "CKD diets focus on acidifying urine, while IBD diets focus on alkalizing it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The primary challenge is balancing the need for controlled, high-quality protein in CKD (to manage azotemia) with the need for novel or hydrolyzed protein sources in IBD (to reduce antigenic stimulation). A common compromise involves selecting a novel or hydrolyzed protein source that is also highly digestible and then carefully controlling its overall quantity to meet CKD requirements without inducing protein deficiency."
