            "question": "A client presents with a 7-year-old Labrador Retriever who is 15% overweight and has mild arthritis. Which of the following represents a SMART objective for this dog's nutrition program?",

            "question": "During the 'Launch & Learn' (L) stage, initial monitoring reveals a dog exhibiting mild digestive upset (soft stools) after transitioning to a new diet. What is the most appropriate immediate action?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately revert to the old diet entirely.",
                "Increase the new diet portion to help the dog adjust faster.",
                "Slow down the transition process, reducing the amount of new food and increasing the old food ratio, while observing for improvement.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digestive upset during a diet transition often indicates the change was too rapid. Slowing down the transition allows the dog's digestive system to adapt gradually, minimizing discomfort and promoting successful acceptance of the new diet."

            "question": "After 8 weeks, a program designed for weight loss shows the dog has only lost 2% of its body weight, falling short of the 8% target. The client reports strict adherence. What is the most likely area for program optimization?",
            "options": [
                "The client is secretly feeding treats despite reporting strict adherence.",
                "The initial caloric calculation was too high, or the dog's metabolic rate is lower than estimated; a re-evaluation of energy needs is required.",
                "The dog needs a different brand of food.",
                "The program needs to incorporate more complex carbohydrates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If adherence is strict but results are insufficient, the most common issue is an inaccurate energy intake assessment. Re-evaluating the dog's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and activity level to adjust caloric targets is critical for effective weight loss."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term program management involves shifting from a weight-loss phase to a maintenance phase, which may require different caloric and nutrient profiles. Ongoing monitoring and proactive adjustments ensure the dog's needs are met as they age or their lifestyle changes, preventing plateaus or regressions."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "For a dog with a pre-existing kidney condition, a high-protein diet can be detrimental. The immediate priority is to ensure veterinary attention to assess the kidney function, and then collaborate with the vet to design a renally appropriate diet, emphasizing the importance of not making significant dietary changes without professional guidance for dogs with medical conditions."

This emphasizes the critical interplay between which two stages of the F.U.E.L. Framework™?",
