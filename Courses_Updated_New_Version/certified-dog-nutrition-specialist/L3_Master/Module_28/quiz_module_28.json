            "question": "In a dog presenting with acute severe anorexia due to trauma, what is the primary benefit of initiating early enteral nutrition (EEN) within 24-48 hours, assuming gut integrity?",
            "options": [
                "To completely reverse existing malnutrition rapidly.",
                "To maintain gut barrier function and prevent bacterial translocation.",
                "To stimulate the dog's natural appetite through food smells.",
                "To reduce the need for intravenous fluid therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early enteral nutrition (EEN) is crucial for maintaining gut barrier function, preventing bacterial translocation, and preserving gut health, even if full caloric needs are not met initially. It helps mitigate the risks associated with prolonged gut disuse."

            "question": "A severely malnourished dog is started on nutritional support. Which electrolyte is most critical to monitor closely during the initial 72 hours to prevent or manage refeeding syndrome?",
            "options": [
                "Sodium",
                "Calcium",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypophosphatemia is a hallmark of refeeding syndrome due to the rapid intracellular shift of phosphorus as cells begin to metabolize carbohydrates. Close monitoring and supplementation of phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium are essential."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "For a dog diagnosed with chronic enteropathy suspected to be food-responsive, what is the recommended initial dietary trial approach?",
            "options": [
                "A raw food diet to maximize nutrient bioavailability.",
                "A high-fiber diet to promote gut motility.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Novel protein or hydrolyzed protein diets are considered the gold standard for diagnostic dietary trials in suspected food-responsive enteropathy, as they minimize exposure to common antigenic proteins."

            "options": [
                "To suppress all immune activity through nutrient deprivation.",
                "To provide nutrients that support a pro-inflammatory response.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In immune-mediated conditions, nutritional interventions aim to modulate the immune system, reduce systemic inflammation, and support overall health without broadly suppressing immune function."

            "question": "A 5-year-old intact male German Shepherd is admitted with severe acute pancreatitis, presenting with intractable vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and an inability to tolerate any oral or nasogastric tube feeding attempts for 48 hours. What would be the most appropriate initial nutritional support strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Continue attempts at nasogastric tube feeding with highly diluted liquid diet.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the intractable vomiting and inability to tolerate enteral routes for an extended period (48 hours), total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is indicated to provide essential nutrients and prevent further catabolism while the GI tract rests and recovers."
