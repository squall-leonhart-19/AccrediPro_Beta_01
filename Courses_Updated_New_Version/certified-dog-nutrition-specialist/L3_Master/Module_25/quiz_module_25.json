            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SBI model structures feedback by first describing the Situation, then the specific Behavior observed, and finally the Impact of that behavior. Option C clearly articulates the consequence or effect of the mentee's behavior on the client, fitting the 'Impact' component."
