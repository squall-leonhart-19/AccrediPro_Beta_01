            "question": "A 7-year-old Labrador presents with chronic diarrhea. Recent lab work shows elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), low albumin, and mild anemia. Based on these markers, which nutritional strategy is most immediately indicated for consideration?",
            "options": [
                "High-fiber, weight-management diet",
                "Highly digestible, moderate-fat, protein-sparing diet",
                "Low-protein, phosphorus-restricted diet",
                "High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated CRP indicates inflammation, low albumin suggests protein loss or poor synthesis, and anemia often accompanies chronic inflammation. A highly digestible, moderate-fat, protein-sparing diet supports gut healing, reduces inflammation, and provides essential amino acids without excess burden, aligning with management for inflammatory conditions and protein-losing enteropathies."

            "question": "For a canine client diagnosed with early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) who is still eating well, what is a primary nutritional modification to consider, as supported by evidence from studies like the one showing a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">2.5x increase in median survival time</span> with appropriate dietary management?",
            "options": [
                "Significantly increasing dietary protein to support muscle mass",
                "Restricting phosphorus intake and providing adequate, high-quality protein",
                "Maximizing sodium intake to encourage water consumption",
                "Emphasizing high-fat, low-carbohydrate ingredients for energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In early-stage CKD, phosphorus restriction is paramount to slow disease progression and manage secondary renal hyperparathyroidism. Providing adequate, high-quality protein is crucial to prevent muscle wasting without overwhelming the compromised kidneys, a strategy proven to significantly extend lifespan in CKD patients."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "When advising a client on sourcing ingredients for a home-prepared therapeutic diet, particularly for an immunocompromised dog, which recommendation is paramount for ensuring quality and minimizing pathogen risk?",
            "options": [
                "Prioritizing local, raw-fed sources without specific certifications.",
                "Selecting human-grade, USDA-inspected meats and ensuring proper food safety protocols are followed during preparation.",
                "Relying solely on freeze-dried or dehydrated raw products to avoid fresh meat handling.",
                "Insisting on grain-free, wild-caught ingredients exclusively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For immunocompromised dogs, minimizing pathogen risk is critical. Human-grade, USDA-inspected meats offer a higher standard of quality control compared to uncertified sources. Crucially, strict adherence to proper food safety protocols (e.g., handling, storage, cooking if applicable) during preparation is non-negotiable to prevent bacterial contamination."

            "question": "A client expresses strong resistance to changing their dog's long-standing kibble diet, stating, \"My last vet said this kibble was fine, and my dog loves it.\" Applying principles of motivational interviewing, what is the most appropriate initial response?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately present research studies debunking the kibble's quality.",
                "Acknowledge their concern and explore their understanding of the current diet's impact and their dog's health goals.",
                "Insist that the current diet is detrimental and must be changed for the dog's well-being.",
                "Suggest they find a different nutritionist if they are unwilling to commit."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motivational interviewing emphasizes empathy, active listening, and 'rolling with resistance.' Acknowledging the client's perspective while gently exploring their understanding and goals helps build rapport and allows them to articulate their own reasons for change, rather than feeling lectured or pressured."

            "question": "After implementing a new novel protein diet for a dog with suspected food sensitivities, the client reports persistent itching and mild gastrointestinal upset after two weeks. What is the most logical next step in troubleshooting this dietary plan?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately introduce a different novel protein without further assessment.",
                "Increase the portion size to ensure adequate nutrient intake.",
                "Re-evaluate the diet for hidden ingredients, cross-contamination, or consider environmental factors before making another change.",
                "Recommend adding a high-fiber supplement to address the GI upset."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Before making another dietary change, it's crucial to thoroughly investigate all potential variables. This includes checking for hidden ingredients in treats or supplements, ensuring no cross-contamination, and considering non-dietary environmental triggers (e.g., allergens, stress) that could be causing the symptoms. This systematic approach prevents unnecessary dietary shifts."

            "question": "A 5-year-old intact female Golden Retriever presents with sudden onset lethargy, polyuria/polydipsia, and recent weight loss despite a good appetite. Bloodwork shows elevated glucose and fructosamine. While these point strongly to diabetes, what critical nutritional differential should also be considered in the initial assessment before finalizing a dietary plan?",
            "options": [
                "Food allergy causing secondary endocrine disruption.",
                "Pancreatitis, which can mimic some diabetic symptoms and require different fat management.",
                "Hypothyroidism, as it can cause lethargy and weight gain (though not in this case).",
                "Chronic enteropathy, leading to malabsorption and weight loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the bloodwork strongly suggests diabetes, pancreatitis is a crucial differential to consider. Pancreatitis can cause similar non-specific symptoms like lethargy and appetite changes, and severe or chronic pancreatitis can lead to secondary diabetes (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). The nutritional management for pancreatitis (e.g., very low-fat diet) differs significantly from initial diabetes management, making accurate differentiation vital."

            "question": "A client's dog, who was previously thriving on a raw, home-prepared diet for IBD, suddenly develops loose stools and decreased appetite after a stressful boarding experience. All ingredients remain the same. What is the most judicious adaptive management approach?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately switch to a prescription hydrolyzed protein diet.",
                "Revert to a bland, cooked diet temporarily while addressing stress and reintroducing the raw diet slowly once symptoms resolve.",
                "Increase the fiber content of the raw diet to firm up stools.",
                "Discontinue all supplements and monitor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress can significantly impact gut health, especially in dogs with underlying conditions like IBD. A temporary switch to a bland, cooked diet provides gut rest and is easier to digest during a period of stress-induced gastrointestinal upset. Once symptoms resolve and stress is managed, the original raw diet can be slowly reintroduced, allowing the gut to re-adapt."
