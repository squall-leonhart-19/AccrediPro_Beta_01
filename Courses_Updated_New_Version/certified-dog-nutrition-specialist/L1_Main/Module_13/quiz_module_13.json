            "options": [
                "Exercise",
                "Energy",
                "Evaluation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The F.U.E.L. Framework™ stands for Foundation, Understanding, Evaluation, and Lifestyle, where 'Evaluation' involves systematically assessing the dog's current nutritional status, dietary intake, and overall health parameters."

            "question": "Which of the following organs is primarily responsible for producing the majority of digestive enzymes that break down macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) in the small intestine?",
            "options": [
                "Liver",
                "Spleen",
                "Pancreas",
                "Gallbladder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The pancreas produces crucial digestive enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and proteases, which are secreted into the small intestine to break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, respectively. The liver produces bile, which aids fat digestion, but not the enzymes themselves."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A growing puppy requires a higher percentage of protein in its diet compared to an adult maintenance dog. This is primarily due to the puppy's increased need for:",
            "options": [
                "Essential fatty acids for brain development",
                "Non-essential amino acids for energy",
                "Essential amino acids for tissue growth and repair",
                "Complex carbohydrates for sustained energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Growing puppies have a significantly higher demand for essential amino acids to support rapid tissue development, muscle growth, and organ formation. High-quality protein providing these essential amino acids is critical for their optimal development, as highlighted in protein requirement studies for growing canines (e.g., National Research Council, 2006)."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Which of the following statements about Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically EPA and DHA, is most accurate regarding canine health?",
            "options": [
                "They are primarily synthesized by dogs from linoleic acid.",
                "They are primarily found in plant-based oils like corn oil.",
                "They play a crucial role in reducing inflammation and supporting cognitive function.",
                "They are significant sources of immediate energy for high-intensity activities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids primarily found in marine sources (e.g., fish oil). Dogs have limited ability to convert ALA (from plant sources) into EPA/DHA. These fatty acids are potent anti-inflammatory agents and critical for brain, retinal, and joint health, as supported by numerous veterinary studies (e.g., Bauer, 2011)."

            "question": "A client's dog experiences frequent constipation and struggles with weight management. Based on this, which type of dietary component would a Certified Dog Nutrition Specialist™ most likely recommend increasing, and why?",
            "options": [
                "Simple carbohydrates for quick energy",
                "Insoluble fiber to promote gut motility",
                "Soluble fiber for nutrient absorption",
                "High glycemic index carbohydrates for satiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool, stimulating intestinal contractions and promoting faster transit time, which can alleviate constipation. It also contributes to satiety without adding significant calories, aiding in weight management. Soluble fiber can also help, but insoluble fiber is typically more effective for motility issues."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "A dog presenting with night blindness, poor coat quality, and recurrent infections might be deficient in which fat-soluble vitamin?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin K",
                "Vitamin D",
                "Vitamin A",
                "Vitamin E"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin A (retinol) is crucial for vision (especially in low light conditions), immune function, and the maintenance of healthy skin and mucous membranes. Deficiency can manifest as xerophthalmia (dry eyes), night blindness, compromised immunity, and dermatological issues (Hand et al., 2010)."

            "question": "The proper balance of Calcium (Ca) and Phosphorus (P) is critical for skeletal health in dogs, especially large and giant breeds during growth. An imbalance, particularly an excess of phosphorus relative to calcium, can lead to:",
            "options": [
                "Hypercalcemia",
                "Renal failure",

                "Iron-deficiency anemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An imbalanced Ca:P ratio, especially an excessive intake of phosphorus compared to calcium (e.g., Ca:P ratio below 1:1), can lead to increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. This hormone then causes calcium to be leached from bones to maintain blood calcium homeostasis, resulting in secondary nutritional hyperparathyroidism and weakened bones (Hazewinkel et al., 1985)."

                "30-40 ml"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A general guideline for daily water intake for healthy adult dogs is approximately 30-40 ml per kilogram (or 1 ounce per pound) of body weight. This can vary significantly based on activity level, environmental temperature, diet (dry vs. wet food), and health status (National Research Council, 2006)."

            "question": "Which part of the canine digestive tract is primarily responsible for the absorption of most digested nutrients, including amino acids, simple sugars, and fatty acids?",
            "options": [
                "Stomach",
                "Large intestine",
                "Small intestine",
                "Esophagus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The small intestine, with its extensive surface area provided by villi and microvilli, is the primary site for the enzymatic digestion and absorption of the majority of macronutrients and many micronutrients into the bloodstream or lymphatic system."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "During the 'Foundation Assessment' (F) of the F.U.E.L. Framework™, a Certified Dog Nutrition Specialist™ observes a dog with tacky gums, sunken eyes, and reduced skin turgor (skin tenting). These signs are most indicative of:",
            "options": [
                "Protein deficiency",
                "Vitamin D toxicity",
                "Dehydration",
                "Mineral imbalance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tacky (dry and sticky) gums, sunken eyes, and reduced skin turgor (where pinched skin remains tented for an extended period) are classic clinical signs of dehydration in dogs. Assessing hydration status is a critical component of the initial 'Foundation' stage of nutritional evaluation."
