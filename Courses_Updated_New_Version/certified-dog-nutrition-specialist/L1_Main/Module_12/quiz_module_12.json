            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary role of a Certified Dog Nutrition Specialist™ (CDNS) according to Module 12, Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose and treat canine medical conditions using prescription diets.",
                "To provide evidence-based nutritional guidance, develop tailored feeding plans, and educate clients on optimal canine health.",
                "To exclusively formulate raw food diets for all dogs, regardless of health status.",
                "To recommend and sell specific commercial dog food brands to clients for a commission."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes that a CDNS provides evidence-based nutritional guidance, develops tailored feeding plans, and educates clients, working within their scope and not diagnosing or prescribing."

            "question": "In canine digestive physiology, where does the majority of nutrient absorption, particularly for macronutrients like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, primarily occur?",
            "options": [
                "The stomach",
                "The large intestine",
                "The small intestine",
                "The esophagus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 details that while digestion begins in the stomach, the vast majority of nutrient absorption takes place in the small intestine, which is specifically adapted with villi and microvilli for this purpose."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "During the F.U.E.L. Framework™ Foundation Assessment (Part 1), a client reports feeding their 3-year-old Labrador Retriever 'about two scoops' of kibble twice a day, plus 'a few treats.' What is the most critical next step for the CDNS to obtain accurate dietary information?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately recommend a different kibble brand for better nutrition.",
                "Advise the client to switch to a raw diet for better health.",
                "Request a detailed food log for at least 3-5 days, specifying exact measurements, brands, and all additional items.",
                "Conclude that the dog is likely overfed and recommend reducing the 'scoop' size."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 stresses the importance of precise dietary history. Vague terms like 'about two scoops' are insufficient. A detailed food log with exact measurements and specifics is crucial for accurate assessment of caloric intake and nutrient balance."

            "question": "A 10-year-old neutered Golden Retriever presents with mild arthritis and a noticeable decrease in activity level compared to its younger years. According to the F.U.E.L. Framework™ Foundation Assessment (Part 2), which nutritional consideration becomes more prominent for this dog?",
            "options": [
                "An increased need for high-glycemic carbohydrates for quick energy.",
                "A potential need for fewer calories, increased joint-supportive nutrients (e.g., Omega-3s, glucosamine), and highly digestible protein.",
                "A recommendation to significantly increase fat intake to maintain body weight.",
                "A focus on rapid growth and development, similar to a puppy's needs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 highlights that older dogs, especially those with reduced activity and arthritis, typically require fewer calories to prevent weight gain, while benefiting from nutrients that support joint health and highly digestible proteins to maintain muscle mass."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Which of the following protein sources would generally be considered to have the highest Biological Value (BV) for dogs, indicating a superior amino acid profile and digestibility?",
            "options": [
                "Corn gluten meal",
                "Gelatin",
                "Whole egg",
                "Pea protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 discusses protein quality and Biological Value. Whole egg is often considered the gold standard with a BV of 100, meaning it provides an ideal balance of essential amino acids that are highly digestible and usable by the canine body. Corn gluten meal, gelatin, and pea protein have lower BVs due to incomplete amino acid profiles or lower digestibility."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A dog's diet is heavily reliant on corn oil and sunflower oil, with minimal intake of fish oil or flaxseed. This dietary fat profile is most likely to result in an imbalance of which essential fatty acids?",
            "options": [
                "Too much Omega-3 relative to Omega-6.",
                "An ideal Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio.",
                "Too much Omega-6 relative to Omega-3.",
                "A deficiency in saturated fats."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 explains that corn and sunflower oils are rich in Omega-6 fatty acids. Without sufficient sources of Omega-3s (like fish oil or flaxseed), the diet will likely have an excessively high Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio, which can promote inflammation if not balanced."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which type of fiber is known for its ability to absorb water, form a gel-like substance, and ferment in the large intestine, contributing to beneficial gut bacteria and potentially regulating blood glucose?",
            "options": [
                "Insoluble fiber",
                "Lignin",
                "Soluble fiber",
                "Cellulose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 differentiates fiber types. Soluble fiber (e.g., from oats, psyllium) absorbs water, forms a gel, is fermentable by gut bacteria, and can help modulate blood glucose and cholesterol. Insoluble fiber (e.g., cellulose, lignin) adds bulk to stool and promotes regularity but does not form a gel or ferment extensively."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "A dog consuming an inappropriately high amount of liver on a regular basis is at risk for toxicity from which fat-soluble vitamin?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin K",
                "Vitamin D",
                "Vitamin A",
                "Vitamin E"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 covers fat-soluble vitamins. Liver is exceptionally rich in Vitamin A. While essential, excessive intake of Vitamin A can lead to hypervitaminosis A, characterized by bone abnormalities and other issues, due to its ability to accumulate in the body."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Beyond nutrient absorption, what critical role does the canine gut microbiome play in overall health, as highlighted in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "It primarily serves to neutralize stomach acid.",
                "It is essential for generating body heat in cold environments.",
                "It significantly influences immune system development and function, and can produce certain vitamins.",
                "Its main function is to store excess calories as fat."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 emphasizes that the gut microbiome is not just about digestion; it plays a profound role in modulating the immune system, protecting against pathogens, and synthesizing certain vitamins (like B vitamins and Vitamin K)."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A highly active working dog, such as an agility competitor, requires a diet that supports sustained energy and recovery. Compared to a sedentary house pet, which macronutrient adjustment is typically most crucial for this type of dog?",
            "options": [
                "A significantly lower protein intake to reduce kidney strain.",
                "A higher proportion of easily digestible complex carbohydrates and healthy fats for sustained energy and increased caloric density.",
                "An exclusive diet of simple sugars for immediate energy boosts.",
                "A reduction in all macronutrients to prevent weight gain due to high activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lessons 5, 6, and 7 discuss macronutrient roles. Highly active working dogs require increased caloric density, often achieved through higher levels of healthy fats for sustained energy, and easily digestible complex carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores. While protein needs are also higher for muscle repair, the most significant proportional increase often comes from fats and complex carbs for energy."
