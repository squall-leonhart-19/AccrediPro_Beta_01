                "28-30 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A gradual transition over 7-10 days allows the dog's digestive system to adapt to new ingredients and nutrient profiles, significantly reducing the risk of gastrointestinal upset. This phased approach is a cornerstone of successful dietary changes."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "When establishing monitoring protocols for a dog on a new diet, which of the following metrics is considered the most objective indicator of the dog's overall nutritional status and energy balance?",
            "options": [
                "Owner-reported energy levels",
                "Stool consistency using a standardized scale",
                "Body Condition Score (BCS)",
                "Frequency of barking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While owner-reported energy levels and stool consistency are valuable, the Body Condition Score (BCS) provides an objective, standardized assessment of fat reserves and muscle mass, directly reflecting energy balance and overall nutritional status. This is a critical metric for data-driven adjustments."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client reports their dog developed mild, transient soft stools within the first three days of a dietary transition. What is the most appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately revert to the old diet entirely.",
                "Introduce a novel protein source.",
                "Slow down the transition rate further, potentially increasing the old food proportion.",
                "Administer an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication without veterinary consultation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mild, transient soft stools during the initial transition often indicate the digestive system needs more time to adapt. Slowing down the transition, such as extending the current ratio for a few more days, is the safest and most effective first step before considering more drastic changes."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "After two weeks on a new diet, a dog's food diary shows consistent intake, but its Body Condition Score (BCS) has decreased from an ideal 5/9 to 4/9, and daily activity levels remain high. Based on this data, what is the most data-driven adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "Switch to a completely different protein source.",
                "Increase the total caloric intake, likely by increasing portion size or caloric density.",
                "Introduce a probiotic supplement.",
                "Reduce the dog's daily exercise duration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A drop in BCS despite consistent intake and high activity strongly suggests insufficient caloric intake for the dog's energy expenditure. Increasing calories directly addresses this imbalance, ensuring the dog's energy needs are met."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client's 3-year-old Labrador, historically a BCS 6/9, has been on a new weight management diet for 4 weeks. Monitoring logs show a consistent 1.5% body weight loss per week, and the dog's energy levels are good. The current target is BCS 5/9. What is the most appropriate action?",
            "options": [
                "Increase caloric intake immediately, as 1.5% loss is too rapid.",
                "Maintain the current diet and portion, as the weight loss is within a healthy, sustainable range.",
                "Switch to a higher-protein, lower-fat diet.",
                "Refer to a veterinary nutritionist due to the rapid weight loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A safe and sustainable weight loss rate for dogs is generally 1-2% of body weight per week. A 1.5% loss is ideal and indicates the current plan is effective for weight management without being too aggressive, allowing for continued progress towards the target BCS."
