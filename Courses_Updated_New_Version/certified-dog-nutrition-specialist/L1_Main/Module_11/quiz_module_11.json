            "question": "In advanced nutritional assessment (L1), what is the primary advantage of conducting a comprehensive, multi-day dietary history and food diary over a single 24-hour recall?",
            "options": [
                "It is faster and less intrusive for the client.",
                "It provides a more accurate representation of typical intake patterns and potential chronic imbalances.",
                "It is the only method suitable for assessing commercial kibble diets.",
                "It directly measures nutrient absorption efficiency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive, multi-day dietary history and food diary offers a more accurate insight into a dog's typical eating habits, allowing for the identification of subtle nutritional inconsistencies, chronic deficiencies, or excesses that a single 24-hour recall might miss. This is crucial for advanced assessment and long-term dietary planning."

            "question": "According to AccrediPro guidelines on Macronutrient Mastery (L2), for an adult dog performing moderate daily activity, what is the recommended minimum digestible crude protein percentage (on a dry matter basis) from high-quality sources to maintain optimal muscle mass and metabolic function?",
            "options": [
                "18-20%",
                "22-25%",
                "28-32%",
                "35-40%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While minimum AAFCO guidelines for adult maintenance are lower (18% crude protein on a DM basis), AccrediPro's advanced recommendations for optimal health and muscle maintenance in moderately active adult dogs suggest a higher range of 28-32% digestible crude protein from high-quality sources. This supports lean body mass and various metabolic processes more effectively."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Muscle meats are rich in phosphorus but low in calcium. To achieve the ideal calcium-to-phosphorus ratio (typically 1.1:1 to 1.4:1), the inclusion of edible bone (e.g., ground bone, bone meal) or a balanced calcium supplement is essential in home-prepared and raw diets. Organ meats provide other micronutrients but are not primary calcium sources."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A 6-year-old intact male Bulldog presents with recurrent skin infections, pruritus, and ear infections. After ruling out parasitic causes, the veterinarian suspects a food allergy. Based on advanced diagnostics (L1) and nutritional strategies (L6), what would be the most appropriate initial dietary recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "A high-fiber, low-fat diet to improve gut health.",
                "A grain-free diet focusing on common proteins like chicken and beef.",
                "A strict elimination diet using a novel protein source (e.g., kangaroo, alligator) or a hydrolyzed protein diet for 8-12 weeks.",
                "Supplementation with probiotics and digestive enzymes while maintaining the current diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For suspected food allergies, a strict elimination diet is the gold standard diagnostic and therapeutic tool. This involves feeding a diet with a novel protein source that the dog has never been exposed to (e.g., kangaroo, alligator) or a hydrolyzed protein diet where proteins are broken down to a size too small to trigger an immune response, for a minimum of 8-12 weeks."
