            "question": "A key characteristic of the canine stomach, indicative of its carnivorous ancestry, is its highly acidic environment. What is the approximate pH range typically observed in a healthy dog's stomach during digestion?",
            "options": [
                "5.0 - 6.0",
                "3.5 - 4.5",

                "6.5 - 7.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy dog's stomach typically maintains a highly acidic pH range of 1.5-2.5. This extreme acidity is crucial for denaturing proteins, activating digestive enzymes like pepsin, and providing a powerful defense against ingested pathogens, reflecting their carnivorous heritage."

            "question": "Which of the following is considered an essential amino acid for dogs, meaning it cannot be synthesized by the body in sufficient quantities and must be supplied through the diet?",
            "options": [
                "Alanine",
                "Glycine",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs), particularly omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, are crucial for maintaining skin barrier integrity, coat luster, and modulating inflammatory responses. Deficiencies often manifest as dermatological issues like dry skin, dull coat, and increased susceptibility to infections."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool and helps to regulate bowel movements by increasing fecal volume and accelerating the transit time of ingesta through the digestive tract, making it highly effective for managing constipation."

            "question": "A quick and practical method for a dog owner to assess their dog's hydration status at home is the skin turgor test. How is this test typically performed and interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Gently pinching the skin over the shoulder blades; if it springs back immediately, the dog is well-hydrated.",
                "Checking the gum color; if it's pale, the dog is well-hydrated.",
                "Measuring urine output; consistently high volume always indicates dehydration.",
                "Observing thirst; if the dog is drinking frequently, it is always well-hydrated."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The skin turgor test involves gently pinching the skin over the shoulder blades or neck. In a well-hydrated dog, the skin should snap back quickly and smoothly. A delayed return or 'tenting' indicates dehydration. Other options are either incorrect or not direct indicators of hydration status."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "When formulating a diet for a highly active working dog requiring sustained energy release, which macronutrient should typically provide the most concentrated source of energy to support their demanding lifestyle?",
            "options": [
                "Protein",
                "Carbohydrates",
                "Fats",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fats are the most energy-dense macronutrient, providing approximately 9 kcal/gram, which is more than double that of proteins and carbohydrates (3.5-4 kcal/gram). For highly active working dogs, fats are crucial for sustained energy, endurance, and preventing rapid energy depletion."
