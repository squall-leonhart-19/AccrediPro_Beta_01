            "options": [
                "Diagnosing a specific medical condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease.",
                "Developing an individualized dietary plan based on a dog's life stage and activity level.",

                "Recommending evidence-based supplements to address general nutritional gaps."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Certified Dog Nutrition Specialist™ provides nutritional guidance and support but does not diagnose medical conditions. Diagnosis is the exclusive domain of a licensed veterinarian. The specialist's role involves creating dietary plans, educating clients, and recommending appropriate supplements within their scope."

            "question": "Which of the following is one of the *ten* essential amino acids that dogs must obtain directly from their diet?",
            "options": [
                "Alanine",
                "Glycine",
                "Lysine",
                "Proline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dogs require ten essential amino acids that their bodies cannot synthesize adequately and must be supplied through their diet. Lysine is one of these essential amino acids, crucial for protein synthesis, enzyme function, and immune health. Alanine, Glycine, and Proline are non-essential amino acids for dogs."

            "question": "A client presents with a dog exhibiting symptoms of dry, flaky skin, a dull coat, and poor wound healing. Based on these signs, a deficiency in which essential fatty acid is most likely contributing to the condition?",
            "options": [
                "Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)",
                "Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA)",
                "Linoleic Acid (LA)",
                "Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Linoleic Acid (LA) is a primary omega-6 essential fatty acid critical for maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier, coat health, and normal epidermal function. Deficiency often manifests as dry, flaky skin, a dull coat, and increased susceptibility to skin infections, as well as impaired wound healing."

                "It provides a balanced blend of both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber.",
                "It is rich in essential omega-3 fatty acids for anti-inflammatory support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beet pulp is a common ingredient in dog foods, valued primarily for its fiber content. It provides a beneficial blend of both soluble fiber (which supports gut microbiome health) and insoluble fiber (which aids in stool formation and regularity), contributing to overall digestive health."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin A is crucial for vision, particularly night vision, as well as for maintaining healthy epithelial tissues, proper immune function, and reproductive health. Deficiencies can lead to xerophthalmia, night blindness, reproductive problems, and increased susceptibility to infections."

            "question": "For optimal bone development and to prevent skeletal abnormalities in growing puppies, what is the generally recommended Calcium:Phosphorus (Ca:P) ratio in their diet?",
            "options": [
                "0.5:1 to 1:1",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ideal Calcium:Phosphorus (Ca:P) ratio for growing puppies is generally accepted to be between 1:1 and 2:1, with many experts recommending an optimal range of 1.2:1 to 1.4:1. Ratios outside this range, especially excessive calcium, can lead to serious skeletal developmental issues."

            "question": "A 30 kg adult dog, consuming a diet of 75% dry kibble and 25% wet food, is moderately active. Approximately how much water should this dog be consuming daily, including water from food, under normal environmental conditions?",
            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The general guideline for daily water intake for adult dogs is 50-70 ml per kg of body weight. For a 30 kg dog, this equates to 30 kg * 50 ml/kg = 1500 ml (1.5 liters) to 30 kg * 70 ml/kg = 2100 ml (2.1 liters). This range includes water obtained from food sources."

            "question": "Excessive dietary intake of which trace mineral is known to interfere with copper absorption and can lead to a secondary copper deficiency in dogs?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Iron",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High levels of dietary zinc are known to antagonize copper absorption in the intestines. This competitive interaction means that excessive zinc intake can lead to a secondary copper deficiency, impacting various copper-dependent enzymes and functions in the body."
