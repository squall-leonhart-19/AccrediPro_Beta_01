            "question": "When conducting an advanced dietary history for a client, which detail is MOST critical for identifying potential food sensitivities or allergies in a dog?",
            "options": [
                "The specific order and timing of all food introductions, including treats and supplements, over the dog's lifetime.",
                "The brand and flavor of their current primary kibble.",
                "The dog's preferred feeding location and bowl type.",
                "The owner's budget for premium dog foods."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A detailed, chronological dietary history allows for the identification of potential allergens or sensitivities by correlating the introduction of specific ingredients with the onset of clinical signs. This is more insightful than just knowing the current diet."

            "question": "A 7-year-old Labrador Retriever presents with chronic weight loss, diarrhea, and peripheral edema. Routine blood work reveals significantly low serum albumin (e.g., <2.0 g/dL). Based on these findings, what is the MOST immediate nutritional concern?",
            "options": [
                "Potential protein-losing enteropathy or severe protein malnutrition.",
                "Excessive dietary sodium intake contributing to fluid retention.",
                "Inadequate dietary fiber leading to poor gut motility.",
                "High blood glucose indicating undiagnosed diabetes mellitus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Low serum albumin, especially in conjunction with chronic GI signs and edema, is a strong indicator of protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) or severe protein malnutrition. Albumin is a key plasma protein, and its loss often points to significant gut or liver issues affecting protein metabolism."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A common nutritional predisposition in large and giant breed puppies, such as Great Danes or German Shepherds, relates to their rapid growth rate. What specific nutrient requires careful management to prevent developmental orthopedic diseases like osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD)?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive calcium intake.",
                "Excessively high protein levels.",
                "Inadequate omega-3 fatty acids.",
                "Deficient vitamin C."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Excessive calcium intake in large and giant breed puppies can disrupt bone mineralization and increase the risk of developmental orthopedic diseases like OCD. While protein and fat are important, calcium is particularly critical for skeletal development in these breeds, with optimal intake typically around 1.0-1.5% DM."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Compared to an adult dog of the same anticipated adult weight, a growing puppy's daily energy requirement (DER) is typically:",
            "options": [
                "2-3 times higher per unit of body weight to support rapid growth and development.",
                "Significantly lower due to their smaller body size.",
                "Only slightly higher, primarily for activity.",
                "Identical, as metabolism stabilizes early in life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Growing puppies have significantly higher metabolic rates and energy demands compared to adult dogs of equivalent body weight. This is due to the energy required for tissue synthesis, rapid growth, and higher activity levels, often necessitating 2-3 times the energy per kilogram of body weight."

            "question": "A 4-year-old Border Collie competes in advanced agility for 10-15 hours per week. To optimize performance and recovery, what is the MOST appropriate nutritional strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a diet with increased fat content (e.g., 20-30% DM) for sustained energy, along with adequate protein and hydration.",
                "Maintain a standard adult maintenance diet with occasional high-fat treats.",
                "Increase dietary protein significantly to 40% DM and reduce carbohydrates.",
                "Feed a diet primarily composed of raw meat and bones to mimic ancestral feeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Highly active and performance dogs benefit from increased dietary fat for sustained energy, as fat provides more than twice the energy per gram compared to carbohydrates or protein. Adequate high-quality protein supports muscle repair and maintenance, and consistent hydration is crucial."

            "question": "Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass, is a significant concern in senior dogs. What is a key nutritional strategy to help mitigate sarcopenia and support lean body mass in aging canines?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a diet with increased high-quality protein (e.g., 25-30% DM) to support muscle protein synthesis.",
                "Significantly reduce overall caloric intake to prevent obesity.",
                "Increase dietary fiber to promote satiety.",
                "Supplement with high doses of Vitamin D and calcium."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "To combat sarcopenia, senior dogs benefit from diets with higher levels of highly digestible, high-quality protein (e.g., 25-30% DM). This helps stimulate muscle protein synthesis and preserve lean body mass, which is crucial for mobility and overall health in aging dogs."

            "question": "A client's dog has acute onset vomiting and mild diarrhea, but is otherwise bright and alert. After a brief fasting period (e.g., 12-24 hours), what is the MOST appropriate initial dietary recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Offer small, frequent meals of a bland, easily digestible, low-fat diet (e.g., boiled chicken and rice).",
                "Immediately transition to a high-fiber, low-fat diet.",
                "Administer over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication with their regular kibble.",
                "Feed a large meal of their regular commercial kibble to encourage gut motility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "For acute, uncomplicated gastrointestinal upset, the recommended approach after a short fast is to reintroduce food gradually. Small, frequent meals of a bland, easily digestible, and low-fat diet minimize gastric irritation and aid in gut recovery. High-fiber or regular kibble can exacerbate symptoms."

            "question": "A 9-year-old Dachshund suffers from chronic idiopathic constipation. Which dietary modification is typically recommended to manage this condition?",
            "options": [
                "A diet significantly enriched with insoluble fiber (e.g., psyllium husk, pumpkin) and adequate hydration.",
                "A very low-fiber, highly digestible diet to reduce stool bulk.",
                "A grain-free diet to eliminate potential allergens.",
                "A high-fat diet to lubricate the intestines."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic constipation often responds well to increased dietary fiber, particularly insoluble fiber, which adds bulk to the stool and stimulates colonic motility. Adequate hydration is also crucial. Options like very low-fiber or high-fat diets are generally counterproductive for constipation."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client reports their 5-year-old Pug has been scratching excessively, experiencing recurrent ear infections, and occasionally soft stools. During the dietary history, you learn the dog is fed a chicken-based kibble, receives chicken jerky treats daily, and has a history of responding positively to antihistamines. What is the MOST likely primary nutritional consideration to investigate?",
            "options": [
                "A potential adverse food reaction, likely to chicken.",
                "Hypothyroidism requiring iodine supplementation.",
                "Excessive omega-6 fatty acids in the diet.",
                "Undiagnosed inflammatory bowel disease."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The combination of dermatological signs (scratching, ear infections), gastrointestinal signs (soft stools), and consistent exposure to a single protein source (chicken) strongly suggests a potential adverse food reaction (AFR) or food allergy. A positive response to antihistamines further supports an allergic component, making a food trial with a novel protein or hydrolyzed diet the next logical step."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A 12-year-old Golden Retriever, previously healthy, has recently been diagnosed with early-stage renal insufficiency and also experiences mild, intermittent constipation. Which nutritional adjustment should be prioritized to address both conditions effectively?",
            "options": [
                "A diet with restricted phosphorus and controlled, high-quality protein, along with increased soluble and insoluble fiber.",
                "A high-protein, high-phosphorus diet to support muscle mass and energy.",
                "A grain-free diet to reduce inflammation in the kidneys.",
                "A very low-fat diet to prevent pancreatitis, regardless of kidney function."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "For early-stage renal insufficiency, phosphorus restriction and controlled, high-quality protein are crucial to slow disease progression. For constipation, increased dietary fiber (both soluble and insoluble) is beneficial. This option correctly balances both needs, prioritizing renal health while managing GI comfort. High protein/phosphorus would be detrimental to kidneys, and a low-fat diet isn't specifically indicated without pancreatitis."
