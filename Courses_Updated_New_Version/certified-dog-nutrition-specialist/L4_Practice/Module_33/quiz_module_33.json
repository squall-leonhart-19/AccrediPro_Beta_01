            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "A client asks a CDNS for advice on managing their dog's severe arthritis, suggesting a specific diet they found online that claims to 'reverse joint damage.' The CDNS should:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A CDNS should critically evaluate all dietary claims. While nutrition can support joint health, claiming to 'reverse joint damage' is likely unsubstantiated.

This can include organs like liver, kidneys, lungs, and spleen, as well as bones and blood. While often misunderstood, these can be highly nutritious components of a pet's diet."
