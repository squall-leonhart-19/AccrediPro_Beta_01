            "question": "A client insists on feeding their dog a grain-free diet despite no diagnosed sensitivity, citing social media trends. Which communication strategy best aligns with advanced nutrition counseling principles to address this, as discussed in Module 17 L1?",
            "options": [
                "Directly state that grain-free diets are harmful and provide scientific papers without further discussion.",
                "Acknowledge their concern, explore their motivations, and gently introduce evidence-based information about the role of grains in canine nutrition.",
                "Tell them you cannot work with them if they ignore evidence and insist on their chosen diet.",
                "Suggest they try a different brand of grain-free food known for better quality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Option B utilizes principles of motivational interviewing and empathetic communication, which are crucial for building trust and guiding clients towards evidence-based decisions without causing resistance. Directly confronting or dismissing their beliefs (A, C) is counterproductive, and simply suggesting another brand (D) doesn't address the underlying misinformation."

            "question": "A client is considering a raw food diet for their young puppy based on anecdotal claims of superior health. As discussed in Module 17 L3, what is the most critical nutritional concern you should discuss with them regarding raw feeding for growing puppies?",
            "options": [
                "The high cost associated with sourcing quality, balanced raw ingredients.",
                "The potential for bacterial contamination (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E. coli*) and the associated zoonotic risk to humans.",
                "The significant difficulty in achieving and maintaining a balanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio crucial for proper skeletal development.",
                "The increased risk of obesity due to the generally higher fat content in many raw diets."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While bacterial contamination (Option B) is a significant safety concern for raw feeding, the *most critical nutritional concern* for a growing puppy on a raw diet is often the precise balance of minerals, especially calcium and phosphorus (Option C). Imbalances can lead to severe and irreversible orthopedic developmental issues, making careful formulation paramount for puppies."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A 5-year-old Labrador presents with chronic pruritus, recurrent ear infections, and gastrointestinal upset. After ruling out parasites and environmental allergies, a food elimination diet is recommended. According to Module 17 L4, what is the standard duration for an elimination diet trial to accurately assess food sensitivities?",
            "options": [
                "2-4 weeks",
                "4-6 weeks",
                "8-12 weeks",
                "1-2 weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An effective food elimination diet trial typically requires 8-12 weeks (Option C) to allow for complete turnover of enterocytes (gut cells) and skin cells. This extended period ensures that all potential allergens are cleared from the system, enabling a true and accurate assessment of the dog's response to the novel diet."

            "question": "An 11-year-old Beagle, 'Buddy,' has recently been diagnosed with early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is also showing signs of sarcopenia. Based on the principles of Module 17 L6, which dietary modification is most appropriate for Buddy?",
            "options": [
                "Significantly increase protein intake to aggressively combat sarcopenia.",
                "Feed a diet with restricted phosphorus and controlled, high-quality protein to support both conditions.",
                "Switch to a low-fat, high-fiber senior diet without specific renal considerations.",
                "Introduce a completely novel protein source to prevent further allergies, irrespective of kidney function."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For dogs with early-stage CKD and sarcopenia, the most appropriate dietary approach (Option B) involves phosphorus restriction to slow kidney disease progression, combined with controlled, high-quality protein to mitigate sarcopenia without overworking the kidneys. Significantly increasing protein (A) can be detrimental to kidney function, while options C and D do not specifically address the critical balance required for CKD and sarcopenia."

            "question": "'Dash,' a 3-year-old Border Collie, competes in agility trials. His owner wants to optimize his nutrition for peak performance, as discussed in Module 17 L5. When advising on pre-event feeding, what is the most important recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Feed a large, high-fat meal immediately before the event for sustained energy.",
                "Provide a small, easily digestible meal rich in complex carbohydrates 3-4 hours prior to the event.",
                "Restrict water intake for 2 hours before competing to prevent bloating and discomfort.",
                "Offer a high-protein supplement right before competing to boost muscle strength and recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For optimal performance, a small, easily digestible meal rich in complex carbohydrates (Option B) given 3-4 hours before an event provides sustained energy without causing gastrointestinal upset or impacting performance. Large, high-fat meals or supplements immediately before can cause digestive issues, and restricting water (C) is detrimental to hydration and performance."

            "question": "Sarah has three dogs: a senior Pug with arthritis, an adult working-line German Shepherd, and a growing puppy. They all eat in the same room. According to Module 17 L2, what is the most effective strategy to ensure each dog receives their appropriate diet and prevent food guarding or overconsumption?",
            "options": [
                "Free-feed a single, all-life-stages kibble throughout the day.",
                "Feed all dogs together from separate bowls but supervise closely during meal times.",
                "Feed each dog separately in their own designated, secure area (e.g., crates, different rooms) at specific, consistent times.",
                "Allow the senior Pug to eat first, then the German Shepherd, then the puppy, in a hierarchical order."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Feeding each dog separately in a secure area (Option C) is the most effective strategy for multi-dog households with varying dietary needs. This prevents food guarding, ensures each dog consumes only their prescribed diet, and allows for accurate monitoring of intake, which is crucial for managing diverse health and life stage requirements."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client reports their dog, 'Luna,' exhibits increased anxiety and reactivity, particularly after switching to a new, cheaper commercial kibble. While a veterinary behaviorist is involved, based on Module 17 L7, what nutritional factor is most likely to contribute to such behavioral changes, and how might it be addressed?",
            "options": [
                "High carbohydrate content; switch to a grain-free diet.",
                "Deficiency in essential fatty acids (e.g., Omega-3s); consider supplementation or a higher-quality diet with adequate levels.",
                "Excessive protein intake; reduce protein percentage in the diet.",
                "Lack of artificial colors; add food coloring to stimulate appetite and improve mood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) play a crucial role in brain health, neurotransmitter function, and reducing inflammation, all of which can impact anxiety and reactivity (Option B). A cheaper kibble might have lower quality or quantity of these essential nutrients. Options A, C, and D are less directly supported as primary causes of acute anxiety/reactivity changes linked to a diet switch."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client is struggling financially but wants to provide optimal nutrition for their dog, who has mild skin sensitivities. They are currently feeding a very inexpensive, generic brand. Drawing from Module 17 L8, what is the most practical and impactful recommendation you can offer?",
            "options": [
                "Advise them to switch to a prescription hydrolyzed protein diet, regardless of the significant cost.",
                "Suggest incorporating small amounts of high-quality, single-ingredient human foods (e.g., cooked chicken, plain rice) to boost nutrient density and manage sensitivities without breaking the bank.",
                "Recommend a complete home-cooked diet, as it is always cheaper than commercial food.",
                "Tell them to buy the largest bag of the cheapest food available to save money, as all kibbles are essentially the same."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Option B offers a practical, budget-friendly way to improve the nutritional quality and palatability of the dog's diet, potentially alleviating mild sensitivities without the significant expense of a prescription diet or the complexity and potential imbalance of a full home-cooked diet. Options A and C are often unrealistic financially or nutritionally complex, and D is detrimental to health."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client is determined to feed their adult dog a homemade vegan diet. Beyond ensuring complete protein sources, what is a critical micronutrient often deficient or poorly bioavailable in poorly formulated vegan diets for dogs, requiring careful supplementation, as highlighted in Module 17 L3?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Dietary Fiber",
                "Taurine",
                "Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Taurine (Option C) is an essential amino acid that is often deficient or poorly bioavailable in poorly formulated vegan diets for dogs. While dogs can synthesize some taurine, a plant-based diet can lead to insufficient levels, which has been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in some breeds. Careful supplementation is crucial."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "For a dog diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), beyond using a novel or hydrolyzed protein diet, what additional nutritional strategy, discussed in Module 17 L4, is often beneficial for managing inflammation and supporting gut health?",
            "options": [
                "Significantly increasing insoluble fiber to bulk up stool and speed transit time.",
                "Incorporating prebiotics and probiotics to modulate the gut microbiome and improve gut barrier function.",
                "Feeding a diet very high in fat to provide concentrated energy for weight gain.",
                "Restricting all carbohydrates to starve gut bacteria and reduce fermentation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modulating the gut microbiome through the strategic inclusion of prebiotics (fermentable fibers) and probiotics (beneficial bacteria) (Option B) is a key adjunctive strategy in managing IBD. This approach helps to reduce inflammation, improve gut barrier integrity, and foster a healthy microbial balance, complementing the use of novel or hydrolyzed protein diets."
