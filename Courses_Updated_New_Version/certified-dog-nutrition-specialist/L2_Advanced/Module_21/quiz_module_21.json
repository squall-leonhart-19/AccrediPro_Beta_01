            "question": "A client's dog, Luna, has a BCS of 7/9 and mild osteoarthritis. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate SMART nutritional goal for Luna?",
            "options": [
                "Reduce Luna's weight.",
                "Achieve a BCS of 5/9 within 4 months by reducing caloric intake by 20% and increasing controlled exercise.",
                "Feed Luna less food and give her joint supplements.",
                "Improve Luna's mobility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A SMART goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Option B clearly defines the target BCS, timeframe, and specific actions (caloric reduction, exercise) to achieve it, making it an actionable and monitorable goal, as discussed in L1."

            "question": "When evaluating a commercial dog food for a healthy adult dog, which AAFCO statement indicates the highest level of nutritional adequacy and testing, as per L2 guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "\"Formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for Adult Maintenance.\"",
                "\"Provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages.\"",
                "\"Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that [Product Name] provides complete and balanced nutrition for Adult Maintenance.\"",
                "\"Made with real chicken and vegetables.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AAFCO feeding trials are considered the 'gold standard' for substantiating nutritional adequacy, as they involve actual feeding of the product to animals and monitoring their health outcomes, rather than just meeting nutrient profiles through calculation, which is a key topic in L2."

            "question": "A 5-year-old neutered male Labrador (30kg, BCS 5/9, moderately active) needs a new diet. His RER is approximately 1000 kcal/day. What is a reasonable starting point for his Maintenance Energy Requirement (MER) coefficient for a moderately active, neutered adult dog, as outlined in L3?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 x RER",
                "1.2 x RER",
                "1.6 x RER",
                "2.0 x RER"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a neutered adult dog, common MER coefficients range from 1.4 to 1.6. For a moderately active dog, a coefficient of <span class=\"stat-highlight\">1.6 times the RER</span> is often a suitable starting point to estimate daily caloric needs, aligning with the principles of optimizing feeding regimens in L3."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "For a 10kg dog (BCS 7/9) with an ideal body weight of 8kg, an appropriate initial caloric intake for weight loss is typically <span class=\"stat-highlight\">20-40% below the MER for its ideal body weight</span>. If the MER for an 8kg ideal weight dog is approximately 400 kcal/day, what is a suitable initial caloric target for weight loss, according to L4?",
            "options": [
                "400 kcal/day",
                "320 kcal/day",

                "500 kcal/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To initiate weight loss, a caloric deficit is required. Targeting 80% of the MER for the ideal body weight (400 kcal/day * 0.80 = 320 kcal/day) creates a 20% deficit, which is a common and safe starting point for weight reduction plans, as detailed in L4 for weight management."

            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial characteristic of a therapeutic diet used for a <span class=\"highlight\">food elimination trial</span> in a dog suspected of having a food allergy, as discussed in L4?",
            "options": [
                "High in fat and fiber to promote satiety.",
                "Contains multiple common protein sources to ensure palatability.",
                "Features a novel or hydrolyzed protein source with a single carbohydrate source.",
                "Is grain-free and raw to reduce inflammatory responses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A food elimination trial requires a diet that minimizes exposure to potential allergens. This is best achieved with a limited ingredient diet featuring a protein source the dog has never encountered before (novel) or one that is broken down into small, non-allergenic peptides (hydrolyzed), combined with a single, less common carbohydrate source. This strategy is critical for diagnosing food allergies, as covered in L4."

            "question": "For a dog diagnosed with <span class=\"highlight\">Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</span> experiencing chronic diarrhea, which dietary characteristic is generally recommended to help manage symptoms, based on L5 guidance?",
            "options": [
                "High-fat, high-fiber content.",
                "Highly digestible, moderate fat, and novel or hydrolyzed protein.",
                "Low protein, phosphorus-restricted diet.",
                "High carbohydrate, low protein diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dogs with IBD often benefit from highly digestible diets to reduce the workload on the inflamed GI tract, moderate fat to avoid exacerbating diarrhea, and novel or hydrolyzed proteins to minimize antigenic stimulation and potential food sensitivities. These are key considerations for GI support, as taught in L5."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "A key nutritional modification for a dog diagnosed with <span class=\"highlight\">early-stage Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</span> is, as highlighted in L5:",
            "options": [
                "Significantly increased protein to support muscle mass.",
                "Restriction of dietary phosphorus.",
                "High sodium content to encourage water intake.",
                "Increased dietary calcium for bone health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dietary phosphorus restriction is a cornerstone of managing CKD, as it helps slow the progression of kidney damage and mitigates secondary renal hyperparathyroidism. Protein restriction is also often implemented, but phosphorus is a primary concern even in early stages, a crucial point in L5's renal support section."

            "question": "A client asks about adding an omega-3 fatty acid supplement to their senior dog's diet for joint health. Based on evidence-based supplementation principles discussed in L6, which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend a high dose of fish oil without considering the dog's current diet.",
                "Advise against supplementation as it's rarely effective.",
                "Suggest a supplement with documented EPA and DHA levels, considering the dog's current dietary intake of omega-3s and potential interactions.",
                "Recommend flaxseed oil as an equivalent plant-based source of omega-3s."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective omega-3 supplementation for joint health requires specific levels of EPA and DHA (found in fish oil), which should be considered in conjunction with the dog's current diet to avoid over-supplementation or nutrient imbalances. Flaxseed oil provides ALA, which has poor conversion to EPA/DHA in dogs. This reflects the strategic supplementation approach covered in L6."

            "question": "During the owner education phase (FUEL - E & L), a client expresses concern about their ability to consistently feed a precisely measured diet. What is the most effective coaching strategy, as per L7?",
            "options": [
                "Insist on strict adherence, emphasizing the importance of the plan.",
                "Provide pre-portioned bags of food for the first week to demonstrate the correct amount and discuss tools like kitchen scales.",
                "Recommend a free-feeding approach to reduce owner burden.",
                "Tell them to just \"eyeball\" the portions if it's too difficult."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective coaching involves empathy, practical solutions, and empowering the owner. Providing tangible aids like pre-portioned food and recommending tools like kitchen scales directly addresses the concern about precision and helps build confidence and compliance, a key aspect of owner education in L7."

            "question": "A dog on a weight loss plan has shown no significant weight change after 6 weeks, despite the owner reporting strict adherence to the diet. The dog's BCS remains 7/9. What is the most appropriate next step, based on L8 principles?",
            "options": [
                "Discontinue the weight loss plan, as it's clearly not working.",
                "Further reduce the caloric intake by an additional 10-15% and schedule a recheck in 3-4 weeks.",
                "Increase the dog's exercise significantly, but keep the diet the same.",
                "Switch to a different brand of \"light\" dog food without further caloric adjustment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a dog is not losing weight despite reported adherence, a common and appropriate next step is to incrementally reduce the caloric intake further, often by <span class=\"stat-highlight\">10-15%</span>, as metabolic rates can vary. Monitoring and re-evaluation are crucial to ensure progress and adjust as needed, which is central to L8's long-term management strategies."
