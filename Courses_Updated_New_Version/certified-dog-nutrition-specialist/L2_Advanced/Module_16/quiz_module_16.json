            "question": "A 9-year-old Labrador presents with both early-stage Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Based on Lesson 1's discussion on navigating complex co-morbidities, which nutritional strategy should be prioritized initially?",
            "options": [
                "Strict protein restriction to manage CKD, even if it exacerbates IBD symptoms.",
                "Focus on a highly digestible, novel protein diet to manage IBD, while moderately adjusting phosphorus for CKD.",
                "High fiber diet to support gut motility, regardless of its impact on renal workload.",
                "Aggressive caloric restriction to prevent weight gain, given the dog's age."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex co-morbidities, prioritizing the most acutely impactful or manageable condition first, while mitigating risks for the other, is key. For CKD and IBD, managing gut inflammation and nutrient absorption (IBD) with a highly digestible, novel protein diet is often the immediate priority, as poor gut health impacts overall nutrient status. Phosphorus restriction for CKD can then be carefully integrated without overly compromising protein intake critical for IBD recovery. Lesson 1 emphasized balancing competing nutritional goals."

            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Autoimmune Diseases, a significant meta-analysis presented (e.g., 'Smith et al., 2022') demonstrated that increasing dietary intake of which specific fatty acids can significantly modulate inflammatory pathways in canine autoimmune conditions like Pemphigus Foliaceus?",
            "options": [
                "Omega-6 fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid)",
                "Short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyrate)",
                "Long-chain Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., EPA and DHA)",
                "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 highlighted the critical role of long-chain Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), in modulating inflammatory responses. These fatty acids compete with Omega-6 pathways, leading to the production of less inflammatory eicosanoids, which is crucial for managing chronic inflammation in autoimmune diseases."

            "question": "A 3-year-old Border Collie competes in advanced agility. Based on Lesson 3's guidelines for Peak Performance, what is the recommended primary energy source and its approximate percentage range for peak performance and recovery in such an athlete during competition season?",
            "options": [
                "Protein, 40-50%",
                "Fats, 50-65%",
                "Carbohydrates, 60-75%",
                "Fiber, 10-15%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 emphasized that for canine athletes, especially those engaged in endurance or high-intensity bursts with recovery, fats are the primary and most efficient energy source. Dogs are highly adapted to utilize fat for energy, sparing glycogen stores. The recommended range for fats typically falls between 50-65% of metabolizable energy for optimal performance and recovery."

            "question": "In Lesson 4, we discussed the 'gut-brain axis' and its influence on canine cognitive and behavioral health. Which dietary component is crucial for supporting a healthy gut microbiome, thereby indirectly benefiting cognitive function and reducing anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "High levels of refined sugars",
                "Excessive animal protein with low digestibility",
                "Fermentable fibers (prebiotics) and probiotics",
                "Artificial colorings and preservatives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 thoroughly explored the intricate gut-brain axis. Fermentable fibers (prebiotics) nourish beneficial gut bacteria, and probiotics directly introduce beneficial microbes. A healthy and diverse gut microbiome produces metabolites (like short-chain fatty acids) that positively influence brain health, neurotransmitter production, and reduce systemic inflammation, all contributing to improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes."

            "question": "A 7-year-old Beagle is diagnosed with refractory obesity, having failed multiple conventional weight loss diets. As discussed in Lesson 5 on Challenging Weight Management, what specialized dietary approach might be considered to improve satiety and maintain muscle mass while reducing caloric intake?",
            "options": [
                "A very low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet.",
                "A high-protein, high-fiber, moderately fat-restricted diet.",
                "A raw, prey-model diet with unrestricted portions.",
                "A diet primarily composed of fruits and vegetables."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 highlighted that for stubborn obesity, a strategy focusing on high protein (to preserve lean muscle mass and enhance satiety) and high fiber (to increase satiety and reduce caloric density) combined with moderate fat restriction is often more effective than simply reducing calories across the board. This approach helps manage hunger and supports metabolic health."

            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Advanced Elimination & Challenge Protocols for food sensitivities and allergies, what is considered the 'gold standard' diagnostic method for identifying specific dietary allergens?",
            "options": [
                "Serum IgE/IgG blood testing for common allergens.",
                "A strict 8-12 week elimination diet followed by a systematic food challenge.",
                "Intradermal skin testing.",
                "Observing the dog's response to over-the-counter 'sensitive stomach' diets."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 emphasized that while other tests can provide clues, the gold standard for diagnosing a true food allergy or sensitivity is a meticulously conducted elimination diet, typically for 8-12 weeks, using a novel or hydrolyzed protein source, followed by a systematic food challenge where individual ingredients are reintroduced to pinpoint the allergen. This method directly correlates dietary intake with clinical signs."

            "question": "In Lesson 8, 'Ethical Dilemmas & Owner Engagement,' a case study highlighted an owner who consistently struggled with compliance due to financial constraints. What was identified as the most ethical and effective strategy for the nutrition professional?",
            "options": [
                "Insisting on the most expensive, ideal diet regardless of owner's financial situation.",
                "Providing a range of nutritionally sound, cost-effective options and educating the owner on the 'why' behind each recommendation, while respecting their limitations.",
                "Dismissing the client due to non-compliance.",
                "Ignoring the financial aspect and focusing only on the scientific ideal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 emphasized that ethical practice involves empathy and practical solutions. When financial constraints are a barrier to compliance, the most effective approach is to offer a spectrum of nutritionally sound, cost-effective options. This includes explaining the rationale for each choice, empowering the owner to make informed decisions within their means, and fostering a collaborative relationship, rather than imposing an unachievable ideal."

            "question": "A 10-year-old German Shepherd is presenting with early signs of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CCDS) and mild osteoarthritis. Based on the principles from Lessons 1 and 4, which nutritional additive would offer benefits for both conditions?",
            "options": [
                "Glucosamine and Chondroitin only.",
                "High levels of Vitamin C.",
                "Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) and antioxidants.",
                "Increased dietary calcium."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lessons 1 (co-morbidities) and 4 (cognitive health) both highlighted the broad benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) and antioxidants. EPA/DHA are potent anti-inflammatories, beneficial for osteoarthritis, and crucial for brain health and cognitive function. Antioxidants combat oxidative stress, which contributes to both cognitive decline and joint degeneration, making them a synergistic choice for both conditions."

            "question": "A working search and rescue dog, weighing 30 kg, has just completed a 12-hour deployment in cold weather. Based on Lesson 3's detailed energy expenditure calculations for canine athletes, what would be an appropriate *estimated* caloric intake range for immediate post-activity recovery and repletion, assuming a typical maintenance MER of 1.8 x RER for an active dog?",
            "options": [
                "800-1000 kcal/day",
                "1200-1500 kcal/day",
                "2500-3500 kcal/day",
                "4000-5000 kcal/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 provided detailed formulas for calculating energy needs for working dogs. A 30 kg dog's RER (Resting Energy Requirement) is approximately 993 kcal/day (70 * 30^0.75). An active dog's MER might be 1.8 x RER, so ~1787 kcal/day for maintenance. For immediate post-activity recovery after a 12-hour cold-weather deployment, energy demands are significantly elevated, often requiring 1.5 to 2 times or more of typical maintenance, especially considering environmental stress. Therefore, 2500-3500 kcal/day represents a more appropriate estimated range for repletion and recovery in this scenario."
