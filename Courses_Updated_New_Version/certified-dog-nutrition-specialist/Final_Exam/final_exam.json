            "question": "A 7-year-old Labrador Retriever presents with a Body Condition Score (BCS) of 8/9 and weighs 95 lbs. The ideal weight for this breed and size is approximately 70 lbs. What is the most appropriate initial caloric reduction strategy to achieve a healthy weight loss of 1-2% of body weight per week?",
            "options": [
                "Reduce current caloric intake by 10-15%",
                "Feed 80% of the calculated Resting Energy Requirement (RER) for the current weight",
                "Feed 60-70% of the calculated RER for the ideal body weight",
                "Reduce current caloric intake by 30-40%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For significant weight loss in an obese dog, feeding 60-70% of the Resting Energy Requirement (RER) calculated for the ideal body weight is generally recommended. This approach ensures a caloric deficit sufficient for safe and effective weight reduction (1-2% of body weight per week) while still providing essential nutrients. Reducing current intake by only 10-15% is often insufficient, and feeding based on current RER would maintain the current weight."

                "Escherichia coli O157:H7"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While all listed bacteria can be concerns, Salmonella spp. is the most frequently identified pathogen in raw pet foods and poses a significant zoonotic risk, meaning it can be transmitted from the dog to humans. This is a primary concern for public health agencies and veterinary organizations when discussing raw feeding."

                "Hydrolyzed protein diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A hydrolyzed protein diet is considered the gold standard for diagnosing and managing food allergies. In these diets, proteins are broken down into very small peptides, making them less likely to trigger an immune response. While novel protein and limited ingredient diets can be effective, hydrolyzed diets offer the highest assurance of allergen avoidance during an elimination trial."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Excessive calcium intake in large breed puppies can lead to skeletal developmental issues, including osteochondrosis, due to its impact on bone remodeling and growth plate maturation. While rapid growth itself can be a factor, it's often exacerbated by overnutrition, particularly excess calcium. Large breed puppy formulas are specifically designed to have controlled calcium levels."

                "10-14 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A gradual transition over 5-7 days is generally recommended to allow the dog's digestive system to adapt to the new food. This typically involves mixing increasing amounts of the new food with decreasing amounts of the old food over several days. For sensitive dogs, a longer transition period (e.g., 10-14 days) may be beneficial."
