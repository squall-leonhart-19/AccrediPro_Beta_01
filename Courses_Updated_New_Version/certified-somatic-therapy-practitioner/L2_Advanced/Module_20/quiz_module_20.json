            "question": "According to the lesson on Somatic Defense (L6), 'Segmental Armoring' in the Thoracic segment (chest and diaphragm) is most frequently associated with which emotional restriction?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Thoracic segment, including the chest and shoulders, often holds defenses related to 'heart-level' emotions, specifically suppressed anger, grief, or the inhibition of 'reaching out' for connection."

            "id": "q20_6",

            "options": [
                "The physical strength of the client",
                "The ability to provide specific, nuanced descriptions of internal sensations",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive Granularity is the capacity to distinguish between subtle sensations (e.g., 'a warm, fluttering lightness' vs. just 'feeling okay'), which indicates improved neurological processing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For dissociated clients, the priority is establishing safety and 'Somatic Resources' to prevent retraumatization before moving into deeper bodywork or emotional processing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For a client in a 'high-tone' sympathetic state, the priority is assessing their Window of Tolerance to ensure interventions are titrated and do not overwhelm the nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic pain is frequently associated with hyper-vigilance (noticing every sensation) but very low scores in 'Body Trusting' (viewing the body as a safe place)."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "In the context of the EMBODY™ protocol, why is 'Tracking Change' (L7) performed every 4-6 sessions rather than every session?",
            "options": [
                "To save time during the consultation",
                "Because somatic shifts require time for neurological integration and 'settling'",
                "Because the scales are too expensive to use weekly",
                "To prevent the client from becoming bored"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurological integration of somatic changes takes time; assessing too frequently may capture 'noise' rather than the meaningful, lasting shifts in the nervous system's baseline."
