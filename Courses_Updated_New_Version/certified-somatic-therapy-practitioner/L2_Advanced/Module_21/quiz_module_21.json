            "question": "During the Advanced Intake (L1), which clinical marker most accurately indicates that a client is ready to move from 'Stabilization' to 'Active Processing'?",
            "options": [
                "The client can describe their trauma narrative in chronological detail.",
                "The client demonstrates a 'Window of Tolerance' that allows for pendulation without dissociative episodes.",
                "The client has completed at least 10 sessions of traditional talk therapy.",
                "The client expresses a strong cognitive desire to 'get over' the trauma quickly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic readiness is determined by the capacity of the nervous system to oscillate between challenge and resource (pendulation) without falling into hypo-arousal (dissociation) or hyper-arousal (flooding)."

            "options": [
                "Movement: The implementation of kinetic exercises.",
                "Mindfulness: The practice of seated meditation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mapping is the critical second step in the E.M.B.O.D.Y. framework, focused on creating a topographical understanding of the client's interoceptive landscape."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Strategic Resourcing' protocol (L3), what is the primary difference between a 'Somatic Resource' and a 'Cognitive Resource'?",
            "options": [
                "Somatic resources are always external, while cognitive resources are internal.",
                "Somatic resources are felt as a physiological shift in the body; cognitive resources are thoughts or beliefs.",
                "Cognitive resources are more effective for trauma than somatic resources.",
                "Somatic resources are only used during the discharge phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A somatic resource must produce a felt sense of safety or ease in the body (e.g., a softening of the shoulders), whereas a cognitive resource is a mental construct (e.g., a positive affirmation)."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When 'Bridging' in an interoceptive plan (L4), the practitioner helps the client connect a 'Sensation' to a 'Meaning.' If a client feels 'tightness in the chest,' which question best facilitates bridging?",
            "options": [
                "How long has your chest been feeling tight?",
                "Can you try to breathe into that tightness to make it go away?",
                "If that tightness had a voice or a specific 'impulse' to move, what would it want to do?",
                "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is that tightness?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bridging moves beyond description into the 'somatic narrative,' asking for the impulse or the 'action tendency' of the sensation to reveal the underlying defense strategy."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A client consistently minimizes their own needs and monitors the practitioner's facial expressions for signs of disapproval. According to Lesson 5, which defense strategy are they likely employing?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response is a relational defense strategy characterized by people-pleasing and the abandonment of self-boundaries to maintain a sense of safety through proximity to others."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "During a 'Discharge' event (L6), a client begins to experience involuntary neurogenic tremors. What is the practitioner's most appropriate action?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately ask the client to stop the movement to prevent re-traumatization.",
                "Encourage the client to 'lean in' and make the tremors as large as possible.",
                "Provide 'titration' by asking the client to slow the movement or pause to check in with their environment.",
                "Ignore the tremors and continue with the planned cognitive exercises."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Discharge must be titrated. Allowing a full, unmanaged autonomic release can overwhelm the nervous system. Pausing or slowing down ensures the release stays within the Window of Tolerance."

            "id": "q21_7",

                "Surrendering to the practitioner's authority.",
                "The physical and energetic meeting of the body with a support surface (like a chair or floor).",
                "Giving up on the therapeutic process when it becomes too difficult.",
                "A state of total muscle flaccidity and collapse."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yielding is an active, conscious relationship with gravity and support. It is the physiological prerequisite for true relaxation and the integration of new neural patterns."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "In 'Case Management and Long-Term Maintenance' (L8), what is the 'Somatic Baseline' used for?",
            "options": [
                "To compare the client's progress against a national average.",
                "To determine how many more sessions the insurance company will pay for.",

                "To diagnose specific DSM-5 mental health disorders."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A somatic baseline is a personalized 'map' of a client's regulated state, allowing them to self-monitor and apply resources before a full dysregulation occurs."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that treatment plans incorporating 'Interoceptive Exposure' result in a _____ higher rate of symptom reduction compared to talk therapy alone for PTSD.",

                "60-75%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that adding interoceptive (body-based) elements significantly enhances the efficacy of trauma treatment, typically showing a 35-42% improvement over traditional cognitive methods."

            "id": "q21_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is about 'generalization'—taking the safety and regulation achieved in the clinic and successfully applying it to real-world stressors and environments."
