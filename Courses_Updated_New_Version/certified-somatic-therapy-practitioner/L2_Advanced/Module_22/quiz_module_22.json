            "options": [
                "A one-time legal document signed at the beginning of the therapeutic relationship.",
                "An ongoing, embodied dialogue where consent is renegotiated in real-time based on the client's interoceptive feedback.",
                "A verbal agreement that covers all future sessions once the initial assessment is complete.",
                "The practitioner’s right to use touch as long as the client doesn't explicitly say 'no'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dynamic Informed Consent is a continuous process that recognizes the client's internal state may change during a session, requiring the practitioner to check in frequently and respect the 'embodied no'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Countertransference occurs when the practitioner experiences physical sensations or symptoms that mirror or respond to the client's internal state or trauma history."

            "options": [
                "Touch is mandatory for somatic processing to be effective.",
                "Touch should only be used if the practitioner feels it will speed up the healing process.",
                "Explicit, verbal consent must be obtained before every instance of touch, even if general consent was previously given.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical somatic practice requires 'explicit' and 'granular' consent for every instance of touch to ensure the client remains in control of their physical boundaries."

                "The practitioner has more academic education than the client.",

                "The client is usually lying down while the practitioner is standing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The power dynamic is inherent because the client focuses inward on vulnerable sensations (interoception) while the practitioner maintains 'exteroceptive' awareness and authority over the process."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the work and experiencing small amounts of 'charge' at a time to prevent the nervous system from becoming overwhelmed or flooded."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural somatics acknowledges that marginalized bodies may have different baseline 'threat' responses due to systemic oppression, and 'safety' is subjective and context-dependent."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Why is practitioner self-care considered an 'Ethical Imperative' in Somatic Therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Because a dysregulated practitioner cannot effectively facilitate the co-regulation necessary for client healing.",
                "Because insurance companies require practitioners to take vacations.",
                "Because it allows the practitioner to charge higher fees for their services.",
                "Because somatic work is not effective if the practitioner is tired."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic work relies on 'co-regulation.' If a practitioner is burnt out or dysregulated, their nervous system may inadvertently signal 'danger' to the client, hindering the therapeutic process."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client begins to stare blankly, stops responding to questions, and their skin becomes pale and cool. This indicates a 'Dorsal Vagal' collapse. What is the ethical priority?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ethical priority during dissociation is to re-establish safety and presence (grounding) within the Window of Tolerance, rather than probing for more trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transference is a natural part of deep somatic work. The practitioner's role is to maintain professional boundaries while using the experience as a tool for the client's self-discovery and healing."
