            "question": "Which brain region is considered the 'hub' of somatic integration, responsible for translating raw interoceptive data into a conscious 'felt sense' of the self?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Insular Cortex (Insula)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex is the primary brain region responsible for interoception and the integration of internal bodily signals into a cohesive emotional and self-referential state."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A client reports that they can feel 'something' in their chest but cannot distinguish whether it is tightness, heat, or a specific emotion. This client demonstrates high interoceptive sensibility but low:",

                "Interoceptive Granularity",
                "Proprioceptive Awareness",

                "Sympathetic Activation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive Granularity refers to the ability to distinguish between different internal sensations and label them with precision, which is a key goal of somatic therapy."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "During a session, a practitioner suddenly feels a constriction in their own throat while the client is discussing a childhood memory. In Somatic Countertransference, this is best described as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Resonance occurs when the practitioner's nervous system mirrors the physiological state of the client, providing valuable implicit information about the client's internal experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implicit (procedural/emotional) memories are stored in the amygdala and basal ganglia, which is why they are experienced as 'felt' bodily sensations rather than linear, verbal narratives."

            "id": "q12_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Character Armor refers to the physical manifestation of psychological defenses, where chronic muscular tension (holding patterns) blocks the flow of biological energy and emotion."

            "question": "In the context of the EMBODY framework, 'Titration' involves which of the following actions?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the processing of trauma and tension so that the nervous system can integrate the experience without becoming overwhelmed or re-traumatized."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is the rhythmic shifting of attention between a 'stress vortex' (tension/trauma) and a 'resource' (safety/ease) to build the nervous system's capacity for self-regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic practitioners do not diagnose mental health disorders or prescribe substances; their role is to facilitate bodily awareness and nervous system regulation."

                "A signed medical release from a psychiatrist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The EMBODY framework prioritizes resourcing and safety first; without a 'biological resource' or felt sense of safety, the nervous system cannot safely discharge stored tension."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Higher interoceptive accuracy is scientifically correlated with better emotional regulation, as the individual can 'read' their internal state and respond to it before it becomes an overwhelming emotional reaction."
