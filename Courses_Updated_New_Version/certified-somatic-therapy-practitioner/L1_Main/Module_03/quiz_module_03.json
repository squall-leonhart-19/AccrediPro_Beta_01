            "question": "Which specific brain region acts as the 'relay station' that integrates interoceptive data with emotional processing to create a conscious 'feeling state'?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AIC is responsible for 'interoceptive integration,' taking raw physiological data and mapping it into the subjective awareness of an emotional state."

            "question": "According to the 'Body Maps of Emotions' research (Nummenmaa et al., 2014), which emotion is characterized by a significant decrease in limb activity (sensation of 'coldness' or 'heaviness') and a concentration of sensation in the chest?",

            "explanation": "Sadness is unique in its 'deactivating' signature in the limbs while maintaining a heavy or constricted sensation in the chest and throat."

                "To deepen the emotional experience through narrative",
                "To provide a defensive 'story' that shields the individual from raw somatic intensity",

                "To increase interoceptive accuracy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A cognitive overlay is a mental narrative ('The Story') that the brain uses to explain away or avoid the direct, often overwhelming, experience of raw somatic sensation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Implicit memory is 'remembered' by the body as a state or a reaction (procedural), rather than a conscious, verbalized memory (declarative)."

            "id": "q3_5",

                "Why do you think that rock is there?",
                "Is that rock related to your mother?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'And what kind of [X] is that [X]?' is a classic Clean Language prompt that encourages the client to explore the metaphor's internal logic without outside suggestion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pelvic floor and lower core are 'root' areas often associated with foundational safety, survival instincts, and the 'startle response' bracing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High granularity allows the brain to make more precise 'predictions,' leading to more efficient nervous system regulation and better health outcomes."

                "The client must sign a new consent form",
                "The practitioner must 'pace' the client by mirroring their current somatic rhythm and language",
                "The client must explain the entire history of their trauma",
                "The practitioner must use a high-intensity stimulus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pacing builds the 'Somatic Bridge' of rapport; you must meet the client where they are (rhythm, tone, breath) before you can successfully lead them to a different state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Isomorphism refers to when the physical manifestation (bracing) structurally mirrors the psychological belief (carrying a burden)."
