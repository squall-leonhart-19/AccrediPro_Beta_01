            "question": "Which specific brain region is primarily responsible for processing interoceptive data and integrating it into a cohesive 'sense of self'?",
            "options": [
                "The Posterior Insular Cortex",
                "The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The posterior insula is the primary receiving area for interoceptive signals from the body, which are then integrated in the anterior insula to create our 'felt sense' of being."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In Eugene Gendlin's 'Felt Sense' framework, how is a felt sense distinguished from a standard emotion?",
            "options": [
                "It is more intense and easier to name immediately",
                "It is a holistic, pre-verbal bodily awareness that is initially fuzzy or vague",
                "It is purely cognitive and lacks physical sensation",
                "It is a localized reflex that does not involve the central nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gendlin defined the felt sense as a 'large, vague' bodily feeling that contains complex meaning before it is translated into specific words or labels."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When developing a 'Somatic Lexicon,' which of the following words is considered a 'descriptive sensation' rather than an 'evaluative' or 'interpretive' label?",
            "options": [
                "Anxious",
                "Trapped",
                "Effervescent",
                "Ignored"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'Effervescent' describes a physical quality of sensation, whereas 'anxious' is an emotion, and 'trapped' or 'ignored' are interpretations of a situation."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "The clinical practice of 'Titration' is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to fully re-experience a traumatic event to achieve catharsis",
                "Shifting focus rapidly between different body parts to distract the client",
                "Breaking down overwhelming sensations into the smallest manageable 'bites' to ensure safety",
                "Using heavy pressure to ground a client who is dissociating"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration comes from chemistry; in somatic work, it means working with the smallest possible 'drop' of activation to prevent the nervous system from becoming overwhelmed."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Research into the Vagus Nerve reveals that approximately what percentage of its fibers are 'afferent' (sensory) fibers traveling from the body to the brain?",
            "options": [
                "80%",
                "20%",
                "50%",
                "5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve is 80% sensory (afferent), meaning the vast majority of the communication is the body 'telling' the brain how it feels, rather than the brain commanding the body."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'nothing' or a 'void' in their chest. According to trauma-informed mapping protocols, how should the practitioner proceed?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client they are doing the exercise wrong and must find a sensation",
                "Validate the 'numbness' as an active biological signal of protection and map its boundaries",
                "Immediately use vigorous movement to 'wake up' the numb area",
                "End the session because the client is not yet ready for somatic work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Numbness is not the absence of sensation; it is a sensation of 'lack' that often indicates a protective freeze or dissociative response that must be mapped with curiosity."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of 'Pendulation' in a somatic session?",
            "options": [
                "To keep the client's eyes moving in a rhythmic pattern",
                "To oscillate between an area of tension and an area of resource/ease to build resilience",
                "To move the body back and forth to induce a trance state",
                "To ensure the practitioner and client are mirroring each other's posture"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation allows the nervous system to experience a 'rhythm' of contraction and expansion, preventing the client from getting stuck in high-activation states."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A 2021 study on Interoceptive Accuracy (IAcc) found that individuals with high levels of 'Interoceptive Sensibility' but low 'Interoceptive Accuracy' are more prone to:",
            "options": [
                "Athletic excellence",
                "Spontaneous healing",
                "Anxiety and somatic symptom disorders",
                "Superior memory recall"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When someone is highly aware of internal signals (sensibility) but cannot accurately interpret them (accuracy), it often leads to increased anxiety and misattribution of bodily signals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "When mapping 'Visceral Topography,' sensations in the 'Enteric Nervous System' (the gut) are most frequently linked to which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Logical reasoning and mathematical processing",
                "Basic motor coordination and balance",
                "Intuition, 'gut feelings,' and the processing of social safety",
                "Visual processing and color recognition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis is a major pathway for the Vagus nerve and is deeply involved in our 'neuroception' of safety or danger in social environments."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "During clinical integration, why is it beneficial to have a client use a 'Body Map' (a physical drawing of their sensations)?",
            "options": [
                "It serves as a legal document for insurance purposes",
                "It externalizes the internal experience, allowing the client to observe their sensations from a 'witness' perspective",
                "It is used to diagnose specific medical conditions like ulcers or fractures",
                "It provides a distraction so the client doesn't have to feel their body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalizing sensations through drawing helps create 'dual awareness,' where the client can both feel the sensation and observe it, reducing the likelihood of becoming overwhelmed."
