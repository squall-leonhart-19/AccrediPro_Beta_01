            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to Wilhelm Reich’s theory of 'Character Armor,' which segment of armoring is most closely associated with the suppression of vocal expression, 'swallowing' anger, and chronic tension in the cervical spine?",
            "options": [
                "The Ocular Segment",
                "The Oral Segment",
                "The Cervical (Neck) Segment",
                "The Thoracic Segment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cervical segment includes the deep muscles of the neck and the tongue; armoring here literally 'holds back' vocalizations and emotions that the individual feels cannot be safely expressed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a persistent forward lean, a chronically clenched jaw (masseter tension), and narrowed eyes during stressful discussions. This somatic presentation is a hallmark of which postural archetype?",
            "options": [
                "The Flight Archetype",
                "The Fight Archetype",
                "The Freeze Archetype",
                "The Fold (Collapse) Archetype"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Fight archetype is characterized by an anterior shift in the center of gravity, jaw clenching, and 'fixed' ocular focus, representing a readiness for mobilization and confrontation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In the spectrum of somatic tension, 'Hypotonicity' is most frequently a physiological indicator of which state within the Polyvagal hierarchy?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal Social Engagement",
                "Sympathetic Hyper-arousal",
                "Dorsal Vagal Hypo-arousal (Collapse)",
                "The Flow State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypotonicity (low muscle tone or 'flaccidity') is the somatic signature of the Dorsal Vagal response, where the body conserves energy through immobilization and 'numbing' rather than active bracing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which respiratory holding pattern is characterized by a 'splitting' of the torso, where the upper chest moves excessively during inhalation while the abdomen remains rigid or pulled inward?",
            "options": [
                "Abdominal Distension",
                "Paradoxical Breathing (Reverse Breathing)",
                "The Eupneic Wave",
                "Coherent Breathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical or 'Reverse' breathing involves the abdomen drawing in on inhalation, often indicating deep diaphragmatic armoring and a lack of somatic integration between the upper and lower body."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "The Social Engagement System (SES), as defined by Stephen Porges, relies heavily on the 'Ventral Vagal Complex.' Which cranial nerve is primarily responsible for facial expression and the 'mask-like' appearance often seen in trauma survivors?",
            "options": [
                "Cranial Nerve VII (Facial Nerve)",
                "Cranial Nerve X (Vagus Nerve - Dorsal Motor Nucleus)",
                "Cranial Nerve I (Olfactory Nerve)",
                "Cranial Nerve II (Optic Nerve)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cranial Nerve VII (the Facial Nerve) controls the muscles of facial expression. When the Social Engagement System is offline, this nerve lacks 'tone,' leading to a flat, unresponsive, or mask-like facial appearance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Somatic patterns and 'Character Armor' are primarily stored in which type of memory system, explaining why they are often resistant to purely cognitive 'talk therapy'?",
            "options": [
                "Semantic Memory",
                "Implicit/Procedural Memory",
                "Episodic Memory",
                "Declarative Memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implicit or Procedural memory stores 'how-to' information and motor patterns. Because somatic bracing is a learned motor habit, it exists below the level of conscious narrative memory."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "During an observation session, you notice a client’s leg begins to jiggle rhythmically whenever they mention their childhood home. This repetitive, involuntary movement is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "A conscious choice to self-soothe",
                "A cognitive bypass",
                "A somatic trauma loop or 'discharge' attempt",
                "A lack of client motivation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Repetitive micro-movements or 'loops' often represent incomplete motor impulses from the past (Fight/Flight) that are being triggered by the current context or memory."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "The 'Practitioner’s Eye' utilizes a technique called 'Soft Gaze.' What is the primary clinical purpose of this technique?",
            "options": [
                "To intimidate the client into revealing more information",
                "To focus intensely on a single muscle group for diagnosis",
                "To perceive global patterns of movement and subtle micro-expressions across the whole body",
                "To avoid making eye contact with the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A soft gaze allows the practitioner to take in the client's entire somatic field, making it easier to notice peripheral movements, respiratory shifts, and the relationship between different body segments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'thoracic armoring' (a rigid, puffed-out chest) and a chronic inability to fully exhale. According to somatic theory, this pattern is often a defense against:",
            "options": [
                "Feelings of grief, longing, or vulnerability",
                "Excessive physical exercise",
                "High levels of intellectual stimulation",
                "A healthy Social Engagement System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The chest/thoracic segment is the seat of the heart and lungs; armoring here often serves to protect the individual from 'heartbreak,' grief, or the vulnerability associated with deep emotional longing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key differentiator between 'Hypertonicity' and 'Functional Strength'?",
            "options": [
                "Hypertonicity is always stronger than functional strength",
                "Functional strength allows for fluid relaxation; hypertonicity is a 'fixed' state of contraction regardless of the task",
                "Hypertonicity is only found in athletes",
                "There is no difference between the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional strength is adaptive—muscles engage when needed and relax when not. Hypertonicity is a chronic 'on' switch, where the muscle maintains tension even at rest, leading to fatigue and reduced range of motion."
