            "question": "In the context of the Architecture of Somatic Resilience (L1), how is 'Biological Capacity' fundamentally defined?",
            "options": [
                "The mental willpower to ignore physical pain during a stress response",
                "The physiological threshold of the nervous system to process and discharge arousal without becoming dysregulated",
                "The ability to maintain a heart rate below 60 BPM regardless of external stressors",
                "The total volume of oxygen the lungs can hold during deep diaphragmatic breathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological capacity refers to the nervous system's ability to contain and process high-intensity energy (arousal) and return to homeostasis without falling into chronic hyper-arousal or hypo-arousal."

            "question": "According to the principles of Neuroception (L2), which part of the brain is primarily responsible for the subconscious detection of safety and danger cues?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Somatosensory Cortex",
                "The Subcortical structures (including the Amygdala and Brainstem)",
                "The Hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is a subcortical process that happens below conscious awareness, primarily involving the brainstem and limbic structures to assess environmental safety."

            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses Sensory Discrimination. What is the clinical significance of a client developing 'High Granularity' in their somatic mapping?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the client to distinguish subtle nuances between sensations, such as 'pulsing' versus 'throbbing,' which facilitates more precise processing",
                "It ensures the client can ignore physical sensations in favor of cognitive storytelling",
                "It reduces the client's ability to feel pain by numbing the nerve endings",
                "It increases the likelihood of the client becoming overwhelmed by too much detail"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High granularity in sensory discrimination allows for better 'mapping' of the internal state, which is essential for titration and prevents the 'all-or-nothing' response of a dysregulated system."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "The 'Somatic Bridge' (L4) is designed to link sensation to narrative. Which of the following best describes the 'Bottom-Up' approach in this process?",
            "options": [
                "Analyzing childhood memories to explain why the back feels tight",
                "Using logic and reasoning to convince the body it is safe",
                "Starting with the raw physiological sensation and allowing the meaning or 'story' to emerge from the body's felt sense",
                "Following a scripted cognitive behavioral therapy protocol to change physical habits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing starts with sensory input (the body) and moves toward the higher brain centers (meaning/narrative), rather than imposing a story onto the body."

            "question": "In Structural Observation (L5), what does 'Postural Bracing' typically signify in a trauma-informed context?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of physical exercise and poor muscular development",
                "A conscious choice to appear more intimidating to others",
                "An unconscious 'armoring' or muscular holding pattern designed to protect the organism from perceived threat",
                "A genetic predisposition to scoliosis or skeletal misalignment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postural bracing is an involuntary somatic defense mechanism where the body 'armors' itself against perceived danger, often reflecting unresolved stress cycles."

            "question": "During a 'Controlled Discharge' (L6), a client begins to experience mild shivering and heat. What is the most appropriate practitioner response?",
            "options": [
                "Stop the session immediately as the client is having a seizure",
                "Encourage the client to suppress the shaking to maintain emotional control",
                "Provide a blanket and ask the client to ignore the sensation",
                "Validate the response as a natural completion of a stress cycle and encourage the client to 'stay with' the sensation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Shivering, trembling, and heat are classic signs of the nervous system discharging stored sympathetic energy; the practitioner should support this completion through titration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Integration relies on neuroplasticity, where consistent somatic practice strengthens new neural pathways, eventually making the 'regulated' state the new default baseline."

            "question": "In the EMBODY Roadmap (L8), what is the primary goal of the 'M' (Mapping) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To create a literal map of the client's neighborhood to find safety",
                "To identify the specific location, quality, and intensity of sensations within the body",
                "To map out the client's family tree to find genetic trauma",
                "To schedule all future therapy sessions for the next six months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mapping in the EMBODY roadmap refers to the process of internal sensory tracking, helping the client identify where and how they feel sensations in the body."

            "options": [
                "Cognitive dissonance regarding the therapist's credentials",
                "A neuroception of danger triggered by environmental cues (lack of exits/visibility)",
                "A lack of motivation to heal",
                "The client being intentionally difficult"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception evaluates environmental cues (like lack of light or exits) independently of the person's conscious thoughts or the therapist's behavior."

            "question": "When applying the EMBODY Roadmap, why is 'Titration' considered a critical safety skill?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures the practitioner is paid in small increments",
                "It allows the client to process trauma in small, manageable 'bytes' to prevent overwhelming the nervous system",
                "It speeds up the healing process by forcing the client to face their biggest fears first",
                "It is a requirement for insurance billing purposes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the work and breaking it into small pieces, ensuring the client stays within their Window of Tolerance and avoids re-traumatization."
