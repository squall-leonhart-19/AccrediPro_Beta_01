            "question": "In the context of Somatic Therapy, how does 'Yielding' fundamentally differ from 'Collapsing'?",
            "options": [
                "Yielding involves a passive loss of muscle tone, while collapsing is an active choice.",
                "Yielding is an active, conscious meeting of the support surface with tone, whereas collapsing is a passive surrender to gravity without internal presence.",
                "Collapsing is a parasympathetic state, while yielding is a sympathetic state.",
                "There is no physiological difference; they are different terms for relaxation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yielding is a 'dynamic meeting' of the earth or support with conscious presence and underlying muscle tone, whereas collapsing represents a lack of presence and a total loss of structural integrity."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of neuroplasticity discussed in Lesson 2, what is the primary role of 'Myelin' in somatic rewiring?",
            "options": [
                "To trigger the 'fight or flight' response during trauma release.",
                "To decrease the speed of electrical impulses to allow for deeper relaxation.",
                "To insulate axons and increase the speed and efficiency of neural transmissions for newly learned somatic patterns.",
                "To dissolve old memories stored in the fascia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Myelin acts as insulation for neural pathways; as we repeat new somatic patterns, myelination increases the efficiency and 'permanence' of those pathways."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'floaty' or 'unmoored' after a deep emotional release. Which somatic system should the practitioner engage to help them 'Yield to Gravity'?",
            "options": [
                "The Digestive system",
                "The Vestibular and Proprioceptive systems",
                "The Endocrine system",
                "The Lymphatic system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vestibular system (balance) and proprioceptive system (body position) are the primary systems involved in orienting the body to gravity and the earth's surface."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 describes the 'Void' or 'Liminal Space' as a critical phase of integration. What is the practitioner's primary role during this phase?",
            "options": [
                "To fill the silence with guided imagery to prevent the client from feeling bored.",
                "To immediately move into cognitive processing and talk therapy.",
                "To hold a 'containment' space, allowing the client to exist in stillness without the pressure to produce a result.",
                "To end the session early as the work is technically finished."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Void' is the fertile ground where the nervous system reorganizes. The practitioner must provide a safe container for this stillness to allow the shift to take hold."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Somatic Anchor' used to finalize a shift in the body's state?",
            "options": [
                "A specific micro-movement or gesture that embodies the new sensation.",
                "Ignoring the physical sensation and focusing only on the story.",
                "Increasing the heart rate through vigorous exercise immediately after.",
                "Leaving the room as soon as the client stops crying."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Micro-movements, specific gestures, or 'voicing' the sensation act as anchors that signal to the brain that the new state is safe and recognized."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Why is the 48-hour window post-session considered critical in the EMBODY cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client is most likely to experience a 'healing crisis' during this time.",
                "It is the period of heightened neuroplasticity where the brain is most receptive to 'locking in' new neural connections.",
                "It is the time required for the fascia to completely dehydrate.",
                "The practitioner needs this time to write their clinical notes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 48-hour window is a period of high neuroplasticity where the nervous system is actively integrating the changes made during the session."

                "Reduced Bone Density",
                "Increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Decreased White Blood Cell count",
                "Higher Blood Glucose levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Higher HRV is a scientifically recognized indicator of a flexible, resilient autonomic nervous system and better emotional regulation."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "In the EMBODY framework, what does 'Closing the Loop' signify?",
            "options": [
                "Ending the relationship with the client permanently.",
                "Returning to the initial 'Establish Safety' phase to verify the shift.",
                "Ensuring the 'discharge' of energy is followed by a conscious 'yield' and 'integration' so the cycle is complete.",
                "Charging the client for the next module."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Closing the loop ensures that the energy mobilized during the session is not left 'hanging' but is integrated back into the client's baseline functioning."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client experiences a significant release of chronic shoulder tension. To ensure this isn't just a temporary 'relaxation,' which 'Anchoring the Shift' technique should be applied?",
            "options": [
                "Ask the client to describe the 'texture' and 'color' of the new openness and find a small movement that expresses it.",
                "Tell the client to try not to think about their shoulders for a week.",
                "Suggest they take a sedative to keep the muscles loose.",
                "Immediately perform deep tissue massage on the area."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Engaging interoceptive descriptions (texture/color) and expressing it through movement helps the brain map the new sensation, making it more permanent."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is a 'Secondary Gain' in the context of integration failure?",
            "options": [
                "A financial refund given to the client.",
                "An unconscious benefit the client receives from maintaining their old, dysregulated pattern.",
                "The extra energy a client feels after a session.",
                "The practitioner's fee for a successful session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the hidden benefits (like attention or protection from responsibility) that a client might unconsciously cling to, which can prevent full integration of a somatic shift."
