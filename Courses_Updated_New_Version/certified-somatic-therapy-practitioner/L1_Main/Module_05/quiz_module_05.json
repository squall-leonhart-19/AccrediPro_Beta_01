            "question": "In the context of the Physiology of Completion, what is the primary biological purpose of 'discharge' after a high-arousal event?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the sympathetic tone to prepare for future threats",
                "To release the accumulated survival energy and return the nervous system to homeostasis",
                "To suppress the memory of the event within the hippocampus",
                "To shift the client immediately into a dorsal vagal shutdown state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Discharge is the biological process of releasing bound survival energy (sympathetic charge) that was mobilized for fight or flight but not fully utilized, allowing the system to return to a regulated state."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which term describes the process of slowing down the release of traumatic energy by breaking it into small, manageable 'doses'?",
            "options": [
                "Pendulation",
                "Catharsis",
                "Titration",
                "Vocalization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is the somatic practice of slowing down the processing of trauma and discharge into the smallest possible increments to prevent overwhelming the nervous system."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "During neurogenic tremors, which muscle group is most frequently identified as the primary initiator of the 'mammalian shake-off' response?",
            "options": [
                "The Psoas Major",
                "The Sternocleidomastoid",
                "The Latissimus Dorsi",
                "The Gastrocnemius"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The psoas muscle is the primary 'fight or flight' muscle that connects the upper and lower body; neurogenic tremors often begin or are centered here as the body releases deep-seated tension."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "A practitioner encourages a client to make a low-frequency 'Voo' sound. How does this specifically assist in discharge via the Vagus nerve?",
            "options": [
                "It activates the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate",
                "It creates a vibration that stimulates the auricular branch of the vagus nerve only",
                "It stimulates the pharyngeal and laryngeal branches, promoting a ventral vagal shift and calming the viscera",
                "It forces the client to hold their breath, increasing CO2 levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency vocalizations vibrate the chest and throat, stimulating the laryngeal and pharyngeal branches of the vagus nerve, which helps regulate the heart and digestive system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "If a client exhibits a 'stalled motor impulse' related to a flight response, which somatic intervention is most appropriate to facilitate completion?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to sit perfectly still and meditate",
                "Slow, resisted pushing of the feet against a wall or the floor to simulate running",
                "Rapid hyperventilation to increase energy",
                "Deep tissue massage of the shoulders to force relaxation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Completing a stalled flight impulse involves slow, mindful movements that mimic the original intended action (like running or pushing away) to signal to the brain that the 'escape' is complete."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'marker' of successful somatic discharge during a session?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in muscle rigidity",
                "Borborygmus (stomach growling or digestive gurgling)",
                "The client becoming non-verbal and glassy-eyed",
                "A significant drop in skin temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Borborygmus is a classic sign of the parasympathetic nervous system 'coming back online' as blood flow returns to the digestive organs after a sympathetic discharge."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In the practice of Pendulation, the practitioner helps the client move their attention between:",
            "options": [
                "The past trauma and a future anxiety",
                "The left brain and the right brain",
                "A place of 'resource' (comfort/safety) and a place of 'activation' (tension/constriction)",
                "Intense exercise and complete sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is the rhythmic shifting of awareness between a resource (where the body feels okay) and the traumatic activation, ensuring the client doesn't get 'stuck' in the trauma vortex."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Why is 'catharsis' (intense, uncontrolled emotional purging) often discouraged in modern Somatic Therapy compared to 'titrated discharge'?",
            "options": [
                "Catharsis is too quiet and doesn't provide enough feedback",
                "Catharsis can lead to re-traumatization by overwhelming the nervous system's capacity to integrate",
                "Catharsis is only effective for physical injuries, not emotional ones",
                "Catharsis takes too long to achieve in a standard 50-minute session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While catharsis may feel like a release, if it is too intense, the nervous system cannot integrate the experience, which can reinforce the trauma loop rather than resolve it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "During a session, a client begins to shake uncontrollably. They report feeling 'scared and out of control.' What is the best course of action for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage them to shake harder to 'get it all out'",
                "Tell them to stop immediately and leave the room",
                "Guide them to open their eyes, name three objects in the room, and slow the movement down (titrate)",
                "Ignore the emotional report and focus only on the physical movement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a discharge becomes overwhelming, the practitioner must help the client 'contain' the energy by grounding them in the present moment (orienting) to stay within their window of tolerance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which physiological phenomenon explains why a client might experience a 'spontaneous deep breath' or 'sigh' after a period of somatic tracking?",
            "options": [
                "The Bohr Effect",
                "The Respiratory Reset (signaling the completion of a sympathetic cycle)",
                "Oxygen toxicity",
                "Diaphragmatic paralysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A spontaneous deep breath or sigh is a key indicator that the nervous system has shifted from a state of bracing or restriction into a state of release and parasympathetic dominance."
