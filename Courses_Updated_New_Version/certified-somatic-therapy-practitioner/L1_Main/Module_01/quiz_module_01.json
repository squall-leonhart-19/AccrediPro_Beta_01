            "question": "Which branch of the Autonomic Nervous System is primarily responsible for the 'Social Engagement System' and the feeling of physiological safety?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex",

                "The Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (part of the Parasympathetic nervous system) facilitates social engagement, calmness, and the 'rest and digest' state necessary for somatic processing."

            "options": [
                "The conscious evaluation of environmental risks using the prefrontal cortex",
                "The subconscious detection of safety, danger, and life-threat by the nervous system",
                "The cognitive ability to mirror another person's emotional state",
                "The physical sensation of muscles contracting during a startle response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is an involuntary, below-conscious-awareness scanning process where the body identifies cues of safety or threat."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a client who begins to feel overwhelmed by a memory. The practitioner asks the client to 'describe just the very edge of that sensation.' This is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of breaking down traumatic charge or intense sensations into small, manageable 'bites' to prevent flooding the nervous system."

            "question": "In the context of Co-regulation, what is the 'Practitioner’s Presence' primarily intended to achieve?",
            "options": [
                "To provide the client with logical solutions to their somatic discomfort",
                "To act as an external nervous system that models stability and safety for the client",
                "To ensure the client remains in a state of high sympathetic arousal for maximum processing",
                "To direct the client's movements through specific yoga-based postures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation involves the practitioner maintaining a regulated state (Ventral Vagal) to help the client's nervous system find its way back to safety through resonance."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which specific action is a core component of 'Orientation' to the external environment?",
            "options": [
                "Closing the eyes and focusing exclusively on internal heart rate",
                "Allowing the eyes to scan the room and notice objects that feel neutral or pleasant",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orientation involves connecting with the environment through the senses (usually sight) to signal to the brain that the current moment is safe."

            "question": "According to the 'Therapeutic Container' framework, why is 'Informed Consent' considered a somatic safety tool?",
            "options": [
                "It is purely a legal requirement with no physiological impact",
                "It establishes cognitive dominance over the body's impulses",
                "It provides the client with agency and predictability, reducing the threat response",
                "It speeds up the session so more work can be done in less time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Predictability and choice (agency) are fundamental to neuroception of safety; knowing what will happen reduces the 'alarm' response of the nervous system."

            "question": "How does 'Centering' differ from 'Grounding' in somatic practice?",
            "options": [
                "Grounding is about the midline; Centering is about the feet",
                "Grounding focuses on the connection to the earth/support; Centering focuses on the internal midline and core",
                "Centering is only used for athletes; Grounding is only used for trauma survivors",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in all clinical literature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding emphasizes the downward connection to support (gravity/earth), while Centering emphasizes the internal vertical axis and core stability."

            "options": [
                "Numbness, cold skin, and a 'spaced out' look in the eyes",
                "Increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and dilated pupils",
                "A significant drop in blood pressure and fainting",
                "A state of deep relaxation and spontaneous yawning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal is associated with the Sympathetic 'fight or flight' response, characterized by increased physiological activation."

                "The client's history of surgical procedures only",
                "The specific traumatic events that the client must relive to heal",
                "Internal and external resources that the client can use to stabilize their nervous system",
                "The practitioner's financial goals for the duration of the treatment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Safety Blueprint identifies 'glimmers' or resources (like a pet, a specific place, or a breathing pattern) that help the client return to a state of safety."

            "id": "q1_10",

            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the client and tell them they are being too intense",
                "Ignore the sensation and push through to maintain the session's momentum",
                "Subtly use a grounding or centering technique to self-regulate their own nervous system",
                "Ask the client to take over the role of the practitioner for a moment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To facilitate co-regulation, the practitioner must first be regulated. Self-regulation allows the practitioner to remain a 'safe container' for the client's experience."
