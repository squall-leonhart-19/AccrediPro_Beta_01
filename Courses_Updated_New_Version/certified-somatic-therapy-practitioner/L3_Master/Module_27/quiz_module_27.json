            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Central sensitization is a condition of the nervous system that is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic pain, where the system is stuck in a 'wind-up' state of high reactivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In neuro-affirming somatic practice, stimming (self-stimulatory behavior) is recognized as a functional way for the nervous system to self-regulate, process sensory data, or express emotion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Urge Surfing is a somatic-mindfulness technique where the individual observes the rise, peak, and fall of physical cravings without judgment or impulsive action."

            "explanation": "Group resonance occurs when the collective 'social engagement system' of the group creates a shared field that supports deeper regulation and healing than individual work alone."
