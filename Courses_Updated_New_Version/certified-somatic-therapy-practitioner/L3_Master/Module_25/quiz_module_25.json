            "question": "In Somatic Supervision, what is the primary function of the supervisor's 'Interoceptive Tracking' during a session with a supervisee?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the supervisor's own unresolved childhood traumas.",
                "To use their own bodily sensations as a 'tuning fork' to detect the supervisee's somatic countertransference.",
                "To ensure the supervisor remains in a state of high sympathetic arousal to stay alert.",
                "To mirror the supervisee's posture exactly to create rapport through mimicry."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Expert somatic supervision utilizes the supervisor's interoception as a diagnostic tool; sensations in the supervisor's body often provide data about the 'third field' created by the supervisee and their client."

        {
            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "Which phenomenon occurs when the supervisee unconsciously recreates the client's nervous system state (e.g., bracing or dissociation) during the supervision session?",

                "Cognitive Dissonance",
                "Projective Identification",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel Process is a hallmark of somatic supervision where the dynamics of the therapist-client relationship are mirrored in the supervisor-supervisee relationship."

        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "When applying the EMBODY Method™ to practitioner development, what does the 'O' (Observation) specifically require of the supervisee?",
            "options": [
                "Observing the client's verbal narrative for inconsistencies.",
                "Observing the supervisor's facial expressions for approval.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the EMBODY Method™, Observation refers to the cultivation of the 'Internal Witness,' allowing the practitioner to track their own nervous system states while simultaneously holding space for the client."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, why is the 'Gatekeeping' role of a supervisor considered a significant power dynamic in somatic training?",
            "options": [
                "Because supervisors are responsible for the financial success of the supervisee.",
                "Because the supervisor has the ethical authority to determine if a supervisee is somatically regulated enough to be certified.",
                "Because supervisors must control the physical movements of the supervisee during sessions.",
                "Because the supervisor owns the intellectual property of the supervisee's case notes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gatekeeping involves the ethical responsibility to ensure that practitioners possess the necessary somatic self-regulation and clinical competence to practice safely, creating an inherent power imbalance."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "A supervisee presents a case where they felt 'frozen' during a client's trauma disclosure. Using Trauma-Informed Feedback (L6), how should the supervisor respond?",
            "options": [
                "By critiquing the supervisee's lack of professional distance.",
                "By ignoring the 'freeze' and focusing only on the client's narrative.",
                "By first co-regulating with the supervisee to bring them out of the dorsal vagal state before analyzing the clinical error.",
                "By suggesting the supervisee switch to a different modality that doesn't involve trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-repatterning in feedback requires that the supervisee be in a state of 'Social Engagement' (Ventral Vagal) to integrate learning; feedback given while a supervisee is in 'freeze' will not be processed effectively."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Concordant countertransference occurs when the practitioner (or supervisor) feels the internal state or emotions that the client (or supervisee) is experiencing."

            "options": [
                "The group acts as a collective nervous system that can co-regulate a presenter who is sharing a difficult case.",
                "The group members compete to see who has the best somatic intervention.",
                "The group is used to shame practitioners who make mistakes in front of peers.",
                "The group focuses exclusively on networking and business referrals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Group supervision utilizes the 'Social Engagement System' (Ventral Vagal) of multiple people to provide a wider window of tolerance for the person presenting a challenging case."

            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "What is a key indicator that a practitioner needs 'Somatic Mentoring' rather than just 'Clinical Supervision'?",
            "options": [
                "They need help with billing and insurance codes.",
                "They are struggling to embody the therapeutic presence and require help with their own nervous system integration.",
                "They have too many clients and need a waitlist strategy.",
                "They want to learn how to prescribe psychiatric medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While supervision often focuses on case management and ethics, somatic mentoring focuses heavily on the 'person of the therapist' and their ability to embody the work."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, 'Sustainable Mentoring Practice,' what is defined as the 'Secondary Traumatic Stress' risk for supervisors?",
            "options": [
                "The risk of physical injury during somatic movement.",
                "The risk of absorbing the cumulative trauma of both the supervisee and the supervisee's clients.",
                "The risk of the supervisor becoming too famous and losing privacy.",
                "The risk of the supervisor forgetting their clinical training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervisors are at risk for vicarious trauma because they are somatically tracking the 'trauma load' of multiple layers: the client, the supervisee, and the supervisor's own response."

            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "Which ethical boundary is most critical in Somatic Supervision due to the nature of the work?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the supervisee pays for sessions in cash only.",
                "Maintaining the distinction between 'Supervision' (clinical focus) and 'Therapy' (personal healing focus) while working with the body.",
                "Requiring the supervisee to use the same brand of yoga mat as the supervisor.",
                "Prohibiting the supervisee from reading any books not written by the supervisor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because somatic work involves the body, the line between 'professional supervision' and 'personal therapy' can become blurred. It is an ethical requirement to maintain this boundary while still acknowledging the supervisee's somatic experience."
