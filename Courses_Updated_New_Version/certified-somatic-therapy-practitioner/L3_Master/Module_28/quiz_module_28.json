            "question": "During an acute crisis, what is the primary objective of 'Somatic Stabilization' before any trauma processing can begin?",
            "options": [
                "To uncover the root cause of the current emotional trigger",
                "To widen the Window of Tolerance and establish physiological safety",
                "To encourage the client to fully express their anger through movement",
                "To bypass the body and focus on cognitive reframing techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In acute crisis, the priority is stabilization. This involves down-regulating the nervous system to bring the client back into their Window of Tolerance and establishing a felt sense of safety in the present moment."

            "question": "Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) is distinguished from standard PTSD primarily by which of the following characteristics?",
            "options": [
                "It only occurs after a single, high-impact car accident",
                "It involves lower levels of dissociation than standard PTSD",
                "It results from prolonged, repeated trauma, often within an interpersonal context",
                "It does not involve any somatic or physiological symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "C-PTSD (Complex PTSD) is typically the result of chronic, long-term exposure to trauma (often developmental or relational) and includes disturbances in self-organization and affect regulation."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'functional freeze,' reporting a sense of being 'behind a glass wall' and unable to feel their limbs. Which somatic intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Intense cardiovascular exercise to 'wake up' the system",
                "Deep tissue massage to force sensation into the limbs",
                "Micro-movements and gentle 'orienting' to external environmental cues",
                "Asking the client to recall the specific trauma that caused the numbness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is dissociated or in functional freeze, high-intensity interventions can be overwhelming. Micro-movements and external orienting help slowly bring the client back into their body without triggering further shutdown."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "In the context of suicidal ideation, how does a Somatic Practitioner view the 'urge to die' from a physiological perspective?",
            "options": [
                "As a purely cognitive error that requires logical correction",
                "As a biological drive for 'completion' of an unbearable state of arousal or shutdown",
                "As a manipulative tactic used by the client to gain attention",
                "As a sign that somatic therapy is ineffective for the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic therapy views suicidal ideation as a desperate attempt by the nervous system to escape an unbearable internal physiological state (either extreme sympathetic hyper-arousal or deep dorsal collapse)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "What is the critical difference between a therapeutic 'Biological Completion' and a 'Retraumatizing Abreaction'?",
            "options": [
                "The amount of screaming and physical movement involved",
                "Biological completion requires the client to lose consciousness",
                "Biological completion occurs while the client remains present and integrated",
                "There is no difference; all high-intensity releases are therapeutic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Abreactions are only therapeutic if they lead to 'Biological Completion,' which requires the client to remain 'dual-aware'—connected to the past discharge while remaining grounded in the present safety of the room."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A client with 'Medical Trauma' experiences a panic attack during a routine blood draw. Which somatic concept explains this 'over-coupled' response?",
            "options": [
                "Somatic Vigilance: The body interprets neutral medical stimuli as life-threatening",
                "Malingering: The client is exaggerating symptoms for secondary gain",
                "Cognitive Dissonance: The client's thoughts are conflicting with their actions",
                "Hypo-arousal: The client's nervous system has completely shut down"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic Vigilance occurs when the nervous system becomes hyper-sensitized to medical environments or sensations, causing it to respond to non-threatening procedures as if they were the original trauma."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "If a practitioner begins to feel the exact same 'constriction in the chest' as their client during a high-stakes session, this is known as:",

                "Somatic Countertransference (or Somatic Resonance)",

                "Projective Identification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic Countertransference is the practitioner’s physical experience of the client's internal state. It is a powerful diagnostic tool but requires the practitioner to maintain their own grounding."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Red Flag' indicating that a client MUST be referred to a psychiatric crisis team or emergency services?",
            "options": [
                "The client reports feeling 'sad' after a session",
                "The client expresses a desire to stop somatic therapy",
                "The client has a specific suicide plan, means, and immediate intent",
                "The client experiences a mild tremor during a grounding exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While somatic practitioners can support clients with ideation, active intent with a plan and means constitutes a clinical emergency requiring immediate referral to higher levels of care."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Research on C-PTSD indicates that what percentage of individuals with this diagnosis also suffer from 'Somatic Symptom Disorder' or chronic physical pain?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 10%",
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Between 40% and 50%",
                "Upwards of 70-80%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show a high correlation (often 70-80% or higher) between complex developmental trauma and the manifestation of chronic somatic complaints, including fibromyalgia and GI distress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "During a session, a client begins to shake and sweat. They say, 'I feel like I'm back in the hospital.' What is the MOST effective somatic prompt?",
            "options": [
                "'Tell me more about what happened at the hospital.'",
                "'Try to stop the shaking so we can talk about your feelings.'",
                "'Feel your feet on the floor and describe three blue objects you see in this room.'",
                "'Just let it all out; don't worry about where you are.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This prompt uses 'Orienting' and 'Grounding' to establish dual awareness. It helps the client recognize they are in a safe room (present) while their body processes the trauma (past), preventing a full dissociative flashback."
