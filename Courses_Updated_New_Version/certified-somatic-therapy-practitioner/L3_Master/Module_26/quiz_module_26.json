            "question": "In the context of 'Architecting the Somatic Arc' (L1), what is the primary structural difference between a single session and a comprehensive Somatic Program?",
            "options": [
                "A program focuses on catharsis, while a session focuses on stabilization.",
                "A program follows a longitudinal progression through stabilization, processing, and integration phases.",
                "A program is always longer in duration (90+ minutes) than a standard session.",
                "A program eliminates the need for intake assessments after the first week."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike isolated sessions, a Somatic Program is architected as a 'Somatic Arc' that moves the client through distinct phases: establishing a foundation (Phase 1), processing patterns (Phase 2), and anchoring resolution (Phase 3)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "During an Advanced Intake & Capacity Assessment (L2), which clinical indicator most accurately suggests a client is ready to move from Phase 1 (Stabilization) to Phase 2 (Deep Processing)?",
            "options": [
                "The client can describe their trauma in chronological detail without crying.",
                "The client reports feeling 'numb' or 'empty' consistently during sessions.",
                "The client demonstrates the ability to pendulate between a resource and a mild activation without dissociating.",
                "The client has completed at least 10 sessions of talk therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The capacity to 'pendulate'—moving attention between a felt sense of safety (resource) and a felt sense of activation—is the gold standard metric for nervous system capacity and readiness for deeper work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "In Phase 1 Development (L3), if a client presents with a 'Functional Freeze' response, which interoceptive intervention should be prioritized?",
            "options": [
                "Deep tissue massage to break through the muscular armor.",
                "Exteroceptive orienting to the external environment to establish safety.",
                "Intense breathwork to force the system out of the freeze state.",
                "Regression therapy to find the childhood root of the freeze."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients in a freeze state, internal interoception can be overwhelming. Orienting to the external environment (exteroception) helps the nervous system recognize current safety, which is the necessary first step in Phase 1."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "Phase 2 Development (L4) focuses on 'Deep Processing.' What is the primary function of 'Somatic Titration' during this phase?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the speed of the therapeutic process.",
                "To ensure the client experiences the maximum possible emotional release.",
                "To break down overwhelming traumatic material into small, manageable 'bites' of experience.",
                "To prevent the client from feeling any physical sensations during the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down and breaking experience into small pieces, ensuring the nervous system stays within the Window of Tolerance and avoids re-traumatization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "In Phase 3 Development (L5), 'Biological Completion' is achieved when:",
            "options": [
                "The client understands the cognitive meaning of their trauma.",
                "The trapped survival energy is discharged through motor patterns like shaking, heat, or spontaneous movement.",
                "The client no longer remembers the traumatic event.",
                "The practitioner signs off on the client's final evaluation form."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological completion refers to the physiological discharge of the sympathetic nervous system's 'incomplete' survival responses (fight/flight) that were thwarted at the time of the original stressor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "When customizing a program for 'Performance Optimization' vs. 'Trauma Recovery' (L6), the practitioner should:",
            "options": [
                "Use the exact same protocol for both to ensure consistency.",
                "Shift the focus in Performance programs toward expanding the window of tolerance for high-arousal states.",
                "Avoid all stabilization techniques in Performance programs.",
                "Focus exclusively on cognitive goals in Trauma programs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Performance optimization programs often focus on 'up-regulating' the system and increasing capacity for high-stress/high-arousal states (like competition or public speaking), whereas trauma programs prioritize down-regulation and safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Group Somatic Architecture' (L7), what happens to the intensity of somatic interventions as the group size increases?",
            "options": [
                "Intensity should increase to keep everyone's attention.",
                "Intensity should decrease to maintain collective containment and safety.",
                "Intensity remains the same regardless of group size.",
                "Intensity is determined by the most vocal member of the group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Safety-to-Scale' ratio principle dictates that as group size increases, the practitioner must use more 'grounded' and less 'activating' interventions to ensure the collective nervous system is not overwhelmed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8 (Ethics and Evaluation), what is the '72-hour Integration Rule'?",
            "options": [
                "The client must pay for the program 72 hours in advance.",
                "The practitioner must follow up with the client 72 hours after every session.",
                "The window following a deep somatic shift where the nervous system is most neuroplastic and requires a low-stimulus environment.",
                "The time limit for a client to request a refund for the program."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 72-hour rule recognizes that the nervous system continues to process and 're-wire' for approximately three days after a significant somatic release, requiring the client to practice self-care and avoid over-stimulation."

        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A client in Phase 2 experiences 'Somatic Flooding' (sudden, overwhelming sensation/emotion). According to the EMBODY Method, what is the immediate priority?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to 'push through' the feeling to get to the other side.",
                "Immediate 'Braking' via grounding and returning to a previously established Resource State.",
                "Ask the client to explain why they think they are feeling that way.",
                "End the session immediately and send the client home to rest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When flooding occurs, the practitioner must apply the 'brakes' by redirecting the client's attention to a resource or the external environment to prevent autonomic dysregulation."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "Which tool is most appropriate for the 'Iterative Evolution' of a somatic program (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "A marketing survey about the program's price.",
                "Comparing pre- and post-program scores on a validated Somatic Awareness Scale.",
                "Asking the client's family members if they see a difference.",
                "Changing the program curriculum every week based on social media trends."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iterative evolution relies on quantitative and qualitative outcome tracking, such as using a Somatic Awareness Scale, to objectively measure the program's efficacy and make data-driven improvements."
