            "question": "During the neurobiological process of somatic consolidation (L1), what is the primary function of the 'Reconsolidation Window'?",
            "options": [
                "To permanently erase the original traumatic memory from the amygdala",
                "To move the memory from the hippocampus to the long-term storage in the prefrontal cortex",
                "To allow a retrieved labile memory to be updated with new safety information before it is re-stored",
                "To bypass the sympathetic nervous system and engage the dorsal vagal shutdown"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The reconsolidation window is a period (typically 4-6 hours) where a retrieved memory becomes 'labile' or changeable, allowing somatic practitioners to integrate new experiences of safety and agency into the neural circuit."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Relational Resonance (L2), what distinguishes 'Somatic Empathy' from 'Somatic Contagion'?",
            "options": [
                "Empathy involves feeling exactly what the client feels, while contagion involves intellectual understanding",
                "Empathy involves maintaining a clear self-other boundary while mirroring, while contagion is an unconscious 'taking on' of the client's dysregulation",
                "Contagion is a higher-level skill used by master practitioners to influence the client's heart rate",
                "There is no difference; both terms describe the same neurobiological process of mirror neurons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners must distinguish between resonance (intentional mirroring with boundary) and contagion (unconscious absorption of the client's state), which leads to practitioner burnout."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "In the E.M.B.O.D.Y. Flow framework (L3), the 'O' stands for 'Orienting to Resource.' Why must this occur before the 'D' (Deepening)?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client is in a state of 'Functional Freeze' before processing trauma",
                "To maximize the client's heart rate variability (HRV) for better athletic performance",
                "To establish a 'Somatic Anchor' that allows the client to pendulate out of high-intensity sensations",
                "To ensure the practitioner has completed the billing process for the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orienting to a resource provides the necessary safety and 'brake' system (vagal brake) that allows a client to safely deepen into traumatic material without becoming overwhelmed or re-traumatized."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "According to Somatic Ego State Integration (L4), how does a 'Protector' part typically manifest in the body during a session?",
            "options": [
                "As a sudden collapse into sleep or extreme lethargy",
                "As a specific muscular bracing pattern or 'armoring' that resists movement",
                "As a spontaneous release of tears and vocalization",
                "As a state of 'Social Engagement' and high eye contact"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protector parts often manifest as 'somatic armoring'—specific patterns of chronic tension designed to shield the 'Exile' (vulnerable part) from further pain or exposure."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "In Transgenerational Somatic Mapping (L5), a 'Phantom Narrative' is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "A hallucination caused by severe dissociative loops",
                "A somatic sensation or 'body memory' that belongs to an ancestor's trauma rather than the client's personal history",
                "The process of imagining a future version of oneself during integration",
                "A specific type of nightmare occurring after a deep somatic release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phantom narratives are somatic expressions of 'unmetabolized' trauma passed down through epigenetic markers or family systems, often appearing as sensations with no biographical explanation."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "When navigating a 'Dissociative Loop' (L6), which somatic indicator suggests the client has moved from 'Primary' to 'Secondary' Structural Dissociation?",
            "options": [
                "The client reports feeling 'a bit tired' after the session",
                "The client exhibits a single 'Apparently Normal Part' (ANP) and one 'Emotional Part' (EP)",
                "The presence of multiple distinct 'Emotional Parts' (EPs) that hold different aspects of a traumatic event",
                "The complete absence of any physical sensation in the extremities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary structural dissociation involves the division of the personality into one ANP and multiple EPs, often seen in complex PTSD where different parts of the body hold different 'fragments' of trauma."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "Meta-Integration (L7) emphasizes 'The 72-Hour Window.' What is the practitioner's primary recommendation for the client during this time?",
            "options": [
                "Engage in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to burn off residual adrenaline",
                "Avoid all social contact to prevent 'vagal interference'",
                "Prioritize 'Low-Demand Embodiment' and minimize major life decisions while the nervous system settles",
                "Immediately schedule the next session to maintain the momentum of the release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 72-hour window following a major somatic shift is a period of high neural plasticity; clients are advised to practice 'low-demand' activities to allow the new state of being to 'set' without external stress."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "The 'Master Practitioner’s Evolution' (L8) identifies 'The Double-Gaze' as a core skill. This refers to:",
            "options": [
                "Looking at both of the client's eyes simultaneously to build rapport",
                "Maintaining 50% of awareness on the client's somatic shifts and 50% on the practitioner's own internal state",
                "Using a mirror during sessions so the client can see their own progress",
                "Reading the client's body language while simultaneously taking clinical notes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double-Gaze is the hallmark of master-level resonance, ensuring the practitioner remains regulated and uses their own interoception as a diagnostic instrument for the client's field."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client with complex trauma (L6) suddenly 'checks out' during a session, eyes glazing over and voice becoming monotone. What is the most effective 'Master-Level' somatic intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Ask the client to 'think' about why they are feeling scared to engage the PFC",
                "Increase the intensity of the trauma work to 'break through' the dissociation",
                "Utilize 'Somatic Weighting' or 'Boundary Pushing' (proprioceptive input) to bring the client back to the present moment",
                "End the session immediately as the client is no longer conscious"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dissociation (dorsal vagal) is best addressed through proprioceptive and kinesthetic input (weight, pressure, or movement) that signals 'presence' and 'boundary' to the nervous system."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "According to the Module 29 statistics on long-term integration (L7), what percentage of 'somatic shifts' are lost if not anchored in a lifestyle change within 21 days?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Approximately 40%",
                "Approximately 65%",
                "Over 85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that without 'Meta-Integration' (lifestyle anchoring), over 85% of somatic breakthroughs revert to old neural patterns within 21 days due to the 'homeostatic pull' of the client's existing environment."
