            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "To stay within the scope of practice and avoid the unlicensed practice of medicine or psychology, practitioners must clearly state they do not provide clinical diagnoses or traditional psychiatric treatment."

            "options": [
                "They are too expensive to produce professionally.",
                "They focus on external aesthetics rather than the internal interoceptive process and can create unrealistic expectations.",
                "They violate the practitioner's copyright agreements with photographers.",
                "They are only allowed if the client is over the age of 21."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing in somatic work emphasizes the subjective, internal experience (embodiment) rather than external aesthetic changes, which may not accurately reflect nervous system regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For practitioners in the US (and similar standards globally like GDPR), a BAA is a legal requirement to ensure the software provider accepts responsibility for protecting PHI (Protected Health Information)."

            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to charge less per hour.",
                "It eliminates the need for any intake documentation.",
                "It provides extended time for the nervous system to settle and move through complete cycles of activation and discharge without interruption.",
                "It is the only way to work with clients who have high-arousal trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intensives (multi-hour or multi-day sessions) allow for deeper work by bypassing the 'warm-up' time required in short sessions, allowing the nervous system more space to process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A sustainable equitable model involves designating a specific percentage of the practice for lower-fee slots so the practitioner's overhead remains covered by full-fee clients."
