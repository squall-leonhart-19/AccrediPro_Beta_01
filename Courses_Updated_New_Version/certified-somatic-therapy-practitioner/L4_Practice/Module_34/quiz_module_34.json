            "question": "In the EMBODY framework for group facilitation, what does the 'M' stand for and what is its primary function?",
            "options": [
                "Movement; to encourage physical exercise among participants",
                "Mapping; to assess the collective nervous system state of the group",
                "Modeling; for the facilitator to demonstrate perfect regulation",
                "Moderating; to prevent participants from speaking too much"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mapping is the process of scanning the group to identify the collective physiological state (e.g., high sympathetic activation or dorsal collapse) to inform facilitation choices."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "During the 'Establishing Collective Safety' (E) phase, the facilitator performs a 'Perimeter Check.' What is the goal of this technique?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the physical exits are locked for privacy",
                "To check the room temperature and lighting",
                "To define the energetic and physical boundaries of the 'container' for the group",
                "To verify that all participants have paid their registration fees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Perimeter Check helps participants orient to the physical space and the psychological 'container,' which is the foundation of felt safety in a group setting."

        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "Which concept describes the phenomenon where one participant's somatic release triggers a similar physiological response in others within the group?",

                "The Resonance Loop",
                "The Feedback Interference",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Resonance Loop refers to the way nervous systems influence one another in a shared space, often leading to shared emotional or physiological states."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "When 'Bridging' (B) in a shared space, what is a facilitator primarily doing?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bridging is the skill of taking an individual's insight or sensation and reflecting it in a way that allows the whole group to relate and integrate the experience."

        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Facilitating Collective Discharge' (D), what is the 'Popcorn Effect'?",

                "When a facilitator provides snacks to raise blood sugar",
                "Rapid, uncontained releases happening simultaneously that can overwhelm the group container",
                "A specific breathing technique that sounds like popping",
                "The sound of joints cracking during a somatic stretch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Popcorn Effect occurs when multiple participants have intense releases at once, potentially 'breaking' the container if the facilitator does not titrate the energy."

        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Yielding to Integration' (Y) phase, what is the recommended minimum percentage of workshop time that should be dedicated to integration and closure?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10%",
                "20-25%",
                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To ensure participants leave in a regulated 'Social Engagement' state rather than a 'High Sympathetic' state, 20-25% of the time should be reserved for integration (Yielding)."

        {
            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "A participant begins to experience a high-intensity abreaction (intense emotional release) during a group exercise. What is the facilitator's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the entire group and focus only on that individual",
                "Ignore the individual to avoid shaming them",
                "Stabilize the individual while 'anchoring' the rest of the group to maintain the container",
                "Ask the individual to leave the room until they are calm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The facilitator must manage 'dual awareness'—providing support to the individual while ensuring the rest of the group feels safe and held (anchoring)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "From a business and ethics perspective, why is 'Double-Layer Consent' used in somatic workshops?",
            "options": [
                "To charge the client twice for the same service",
                "To ensure consent is given at registration AND reaffirmed in real-time during physical or emotional touchpoints",
                "To protect the facilitator from all legal liability regardless of conduct",
                "Because one consent form is usually lost during the workshop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Double-Layer Consent recognizes that somatic work is dynamic; a participant may consent in writing but feel differently during the actual physiological experience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key indicator of 'Collective Ventral Vagal' state in a group?",
            "options": [
                "Complete silence and lack of movement",
                "High-pitched shouting and rapid breathing",
                "Softening of facial features, rhythmic breathing, and spontaneous prosody in speech",
                "Participants avoiding eye contact with the facilitator"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement) is marked by physiological softening, regulated breathing, and the ability to connect through voice and facial expression."

        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on group somatic interventions (n=1,240) discussed in the module suggested that 'Co-regulation' in groups can enhance individual resilience by what factor compared to isolated self-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It has no measurable difference",
                "Approximately 1.5 to 2 times more effective due to the 'Social Baseline' effect",
                "10 times more effective",
                "It is actually less effective due to social anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Social Baseline Theory' suggests that the presence of a regulated group reduces the metabolic cost of individual regulation, making it significantly more effective."
