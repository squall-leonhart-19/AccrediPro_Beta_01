            "options": [
                "To list every certification you have earned in chronological order",
                "To align your unique lived experience and somatic expertise with the specific felt-sense needs of a target population",
                "To provide a clinical diagnosis for potential clients before they book",
                "To ensure your marketing sounds exactly like every other somatic practitioner in the field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Niche Resonance Statement moves beyond generic descriptions to connect the practitioner's specific approach with the 'felt-sense' problems of a specific audience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical diagnosis is the domain of licensed mental health or medical professionals. Somatic practitioners track patterns and states rather than diagnosing pathologies."

            "question": "In the Somatic Intake and Assessment Process (L3), why is 'Tracking the Physiology' prioritized over 'Tracking the Narrative'?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client's story is always inaccurate and should be ignored",
                "Because physiological cues (breath, tone, posture) provide real-time data on the client's Window of Tolerance",
                "Because tracking physiology is faster and allows for shorter sessions",
                "Because the narrative is only relevant in talk therapy, never in somatics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological cues are the 'language of the nervous system' and provide more accurate data regarding the client's current state of safety or threat than the cognitive narrative."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective somatic marketing speaks to the client's internal experience, helping them recognize the 'felt sense' of the results they are seeking."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing looks at the long-term impact of the work (e.g., improved relationships, return to work) rather than just the time spent in the session."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Groups provide a unique opportunity for participants to co-regulate with multiple regulated nervous systems, enhancing the 'Ventral Vagal' experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Yielding is a somatic state where the practitioner finds their own support and ground, which prevents burnout and 'vicarious traumatization' by maintaining boundaries."

                "Encourage them to keep going to 'get it all out'",
                "Immediately use 'Titration' to bring them back to a state of manageable safety",
                "Leave the room to give them privacy for their emotional release",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration (breaking down the experience into small, manageable pieces) is essential to ensure the nervous system integrates the experience rather than being re-traumatized."
