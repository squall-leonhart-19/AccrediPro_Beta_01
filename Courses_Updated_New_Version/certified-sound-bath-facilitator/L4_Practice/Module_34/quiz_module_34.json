            "question": "When architecting a group sound experience for 50+ participants, which layout is statistically most effective for maintaining 'Acoustic Uniformity' and ensuring the facilitator remains the 'Sonic Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "A strict linear grid with 3 feet between mats",
                "Concentric semi-circles facing the facilitator",
                "A full circle with the facilitator in the center",
                "Randomized 'nesting' clusters based on participant height"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Concentric semi-circles provide the best balance of sound projection and visual connection, preventing the 'dead zones' often found in the center of a full circle or the back of a deep grid."

        {
            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Collective Resonance Principle' discussed in Lesson 2, what is the approximate 'Critical Mass' percentage required to pull a dissonant group into entrainment?",
            "options": [
                "5% of the group",
                "10-15% of the group",
                "Exactly 51% of the group",
                "Resonance is only achieved if 100% of participants are focused"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into collective dynamics suggests that once 10-15% of a group reaches a state of entrainment, the 'coherent' frequency begins to dominate and pull the remaining participants into the shared state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "In large-scale sonic induction (L3), the 'Inverse Square Law' dictates that for every doubling of distance from the sound source, the sound pressure level (SPL) decreases by how many decibels?",
            "options": [
                "3 dB",
                "6 dB",
                "10 dB",
                "12 dB"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Inverse Square Law states that sound intensity decreases by 6 dB for every doubling of distance, which is critical for volume management in large venues to ensure the front row isn't overwhelmed while the back row can still hear."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "When orchestrating 'Group Oscillating Frequencies' (L4), why is the use of 'Monaural Beats' preferred over 'Binaural Beats' for large audiences?",
            "options": [
                "Binaural beats require headphones to be effective, whereas monaural beats occur in the air",
                "Monaural beats are higher frequency and easier to hear in large halls",
                "Binaural beats can cause collective nausea in groups larger than 20",
                "Monaural beats do not require the brain to process the frequency difference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Binaural beats require a different frequency in each ear (usually via headphones). In a group setting, monaural beats (the physical interference of two frequencies in the air) are the primary mechanism for brainwave entrainment."

        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "During the 'Collective Neural Reset' phase (L5), what is the primary purpose of the 'Valley of Silence'?",
            "options": [
                "To allow the facilitator to pack up smaller instruments quietly",
                "To give participants time to wake up and check their phones",
                "To allow the Parasympathetic Nervous System to fully integrate the shift from Beta to Theta/Delta",
                "To prevent 'Sonic Overload' by clearing the ear canal of residual vibrations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Valley of Silence (usually 5-8 minutes) is the most therapeutic part of the session, where the nervous system 'resets' and the brain integrates the shift into deep relaxation."

        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "Which technique is recommended in Lesson 6 for 'Group Auric Alignment' when facilitating in a public space with high 'Energetic Noise' (e.g., a busy city park or hotel)?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the volume of the gongs to drown out the noise",
                "The 'Sonic Perimeter' technique—circling the group with a singing bowl before the session",
                "Requiring all participants to wear blindfolds",
                "Burning excessive amounts of sage to mask the smell of the city"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Sonic Perimeter' uses sound to physically and energetically define the 'sacred space,' creating a clear boundary between the workshop and the external environment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "If a participant experiences an intense 'Transmutive Release' (L7), such as heavy sobbing, in a group of 40 people, how should the facilitator respond?",
            "options": [
                "Stop all sound immediately to address the individual",
                "Increase the volume of the instruments to hide the sound of the crying",
                "Maintain a steady, grounding 'Sonic Floor' while signaling an assistant to offer quiet support",
                "Ask the participant to leave the room until they are calm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining the 'Sonic Floor' prevents the rest of the group from being pulled out of their state by 'Emotional Contagion,' while ensuring the individual feels supported within the container."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, 'Earth Grounding' is emphasized for community integration. Which specific practice helps transition participants from 'Subtle Body' awareness back to 'Physical Body' awareness?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid jumping jacks immediately after the silence",
                "Vocalized 'Voo' toning or low-frequency humming",
                "Drinking ice-cold water within 30 seconds of waking",
                "Remaining perfectly still for an additional 20 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency vocalizations (like the 'Voo' breath) stimulate the vagus nerve and help 'anchor' the consciousness back into the physical body after an expanded state."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'Collective Effervescence' in sound baths (referenced in Lesson 2) showed that shared group intent can increase which hormone by approximately 20% compared to solo sessions?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Adrenaline",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Group sound experiences foster 'Collective Effervescence,' which significantly boosts oxytocin (the 'bonding hormone'), enhancing the feeling of community and safety."

        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "When managing the 'Re-entry' phase in a workshop (L8), what is the 'Integration Rule of Three'?",
            "options": [
                "Three minutes of stretching, three minutes of water, three minutes of talking",
                "Three deep breaths, three physical movements, and three words of shared experience",
                "Three bowls, three gongs, and three bells to end the session",
                "Ensuring at least three facilitators are present for every 30 people"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rule of Three (Breaths, Movement, Shared Words) provides a structured, safe pathway for participants to return from deep states and begin the process of community integration."
