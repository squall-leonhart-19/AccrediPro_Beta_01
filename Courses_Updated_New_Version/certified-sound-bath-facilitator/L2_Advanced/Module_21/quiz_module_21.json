            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Resonance Scan' (R) within the RESTORE intake framework?",
            "options": [
                "To play every instrument in the studio to see which one the client likes best",
                "To identify specific 'dead zones' or 'dissonant spikes' in the client’s bio-field through auditory and physical feedback",
                "To clean the instruments before the client arrives for the session",
                "To provide a 10-minute demo of the full sound bath experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Resonance Scan is an advanced assessment tool used to identify areas of energetic or physical dissonance, allowing the facilitator to map specific frequencies to the client's unique needs."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the 'Collaborative Goal Setting' (E) phase emphasizes shifting the client from a 'deficit' mindset to what?",
            "options": [
                "A passive listening state",
                "A state of 'Sonic Dependency'",
                "An 'Embodied Intent' focused on desired physiological and emotional resonance",
                "A purely intellectual understanding of frequency medicine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective treatment planning requires the client to move from focusing on what is 'wrong' to co-creating an embodied intent that serves as the foundation for the sonic design."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the 2023 Meta-Analysis cited in Lesson 4, which session in a 6-session cycle is typically the 'Pivot Point' for significant autonomic nervous system recalibration?",
            "options": [
                "Session 1",
                "Session 2",
                "Session 4",
                "Session 6"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that Session 4 is often the 'pivot point' where the cumulative effects of sound therapy lead to a measurable shift in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and long-term parasympathetic dominance."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When 'Frequency Mapping' for a client with acute sympathetic dominance (high stress/anxiety), which instrument selection is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "High-pitched Crystal Triangles and 4096Hz tuners",
                "Rapid, erratic drumming with changing tempos",
                "Low-frequency (sub-200Hz) Large Frosted Bowls or Gongs with long decay times",
                "Sharp, percussive chimes played at high volume"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low frequencies and long decay times help anchor the nervous system and encourage the 'Frequency Following Response' toward a relaxed state, whereas high, sharp sounds may be too stimulating."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "The 'Neural Reset' (N) phase of the RESTORE protocol is specifically designed to achieve which brainwave transition?",

                "Staying consistently in the Beta state for focus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neural Reset uses entrainment to move the client out of the active, analytical Beta state and into the more receptive Alpha and Theta states, where deep healing occurs."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In the context of 'Transmutive Release' (T), what should a facilitator do if a client experiences a 'Sonic Shadow' (emotional release) during a session?",
            "options": [
                "Stop the sound immediately and turn on the lights",
                "Increase the volume to drown out any crying or vocalization",
                "Maintain a 'Holding Cube' of supportive sound and use harmonic resolution to facilitate the release",
                "Ask the client to leave the room until they are calm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The facilitator's role is to provide a safe 'Holding Cube'—a stable sonic environment—and use specific harmonic intervals to help the client process and resolve the emotional material surfacing."

                "Subjective (The client's self-reported experience and feelings)",

                "Standard (The typical protocol followed)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In SOAP notes, 'Subjective' refers to the information the client provides about their symptoms, feelings, and progress, which is critical for tracking treatment efficacy."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Case Study: 'David' presents with chronic lower back pain and high levels of inflammation. Which Frequency Mapping strategy is most indicated?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing on 528Hz and high-frequency chimes in the upper auric field",
                "Using 174Hz and 285Hz weighted tuning forks directly on or near the area of pain",
                "Playing only silence for 45 minutes",
                "Using fast-paced Shamanic rattling to increase heart rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "174Hz (often associated with pain relief) and 285Hz (associated with tissue repair) are standard mappings for physical pain and inflammation in therapeutic sound design."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "What is 'Interval Sequencing' in the context of multi-session treatment planning?",
            "options": [
                "The distance between the instruments in the room",
                "The intentional use of musical intervals (like fifths or octaves) to move a client from tension to resolution over several sessions",
                "The 15-minute break the facilitator takes between clients",
                "The order in which the client signs their intake forms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interval Sequencing involves planning the harmonic relationship between sessions—for example, using dissonant intervals to 'break up' stagnation in early sessions and pure fifths for 'integration' in later sessions."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "Under professional ethical standards, if a client discloses a 'Sonic Trigger' related to past trauma during the intake, the facilitator must:",
            "options": [
                "Use that specific sound to 'force' the client to face their fear",
                "Ignore the disclosure as sound is always healing",
                "Document the trigger and remove or modify that frequency/instrument from the treatment plan",
                "Charge the client a higher fee for a complex session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice and the 'Do No Harm' principle require facilitators to respect sonic triggers and adapt the treatment plan to ensure the client's psychological safety."
