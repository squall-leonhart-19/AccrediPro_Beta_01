            "question": "Which core ethical principle requires a sound facilitator to prioritize the client's well-being and actively work to 'do good' during a session?",
            "options": [
                "Beneficence",
                "Non-maleficence",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Beneficence is the ethical obligation to act for the benefit of others. While non-maleficence means 'do no harm,' beneficence goes further by requiring practitioners to provide a positive, healing environment."

                "Inform them that sound baths are a primary medical intervention for cardiovascular issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sound facilitators are not medical professionals. Diagnosing, treating, or promising 'cures' for clinical conditions falls outside the legal scope of practice and constitutes the unlicensed practice of medicine."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An abreaction is an intense emotional release or 'outburst' where repressed trauma or emotions surface during a session. Trauma-informed facilitators must be prepared to ground the client during these moments."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CDC and Kaiser Permanente studies show that roughly 61% of adults have experienced at least one ACE. This statistic underscores the necessity of a 'trauma-informed' approach for every sound bath session."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the FRIES model (Freely given, Reversible, Informed, Enthusiastic, Specific), 'Reversible' means a client can withdraw their consent for touch or a specific technique at any time during the session."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Traumatic Stress (or Compassion Fatigue) occurs when a practitioner takes on the emotional burden of their clients' trauma, making self-care an ethical obligation for professional sustainability."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
