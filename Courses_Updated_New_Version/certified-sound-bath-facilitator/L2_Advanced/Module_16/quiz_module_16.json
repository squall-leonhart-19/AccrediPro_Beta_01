            "question": "When performing a 'Resonance Scan' for a client with Fibromyalgia (Lesson 1), what is the primary auditory indicator that a specific frequency has identified a 'dissonant node' in the biofield?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in the volume of the instrument without extra force",
                "The appearance of audible 'beat frequencies' or a noticeable wavering in the tone",
                "A complete silence or 'dead zone' where the instrument stops vibrating",
                "The client reporting a sensation of extreme cold in the extremities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Resonance Scanning, 'dissonance' is often perceived by the practitioner as 'beats' or wavering tones (interference patterns) when the instrument's frequency interacts with a congested or 'stuck' area of the client's energetic or physical body."

            "question": "In the context of Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) and Somatic Release (Lesson 2), what is the primary goal of the 'Transmutive Release' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To induce a deep state of amnesia regarding the traumatic event",
                "To facilitate the safe discharge of stored somatic tension without re-traumatization",
                "To use high-decibel sound to 'shatter' the emotional blockages",
                "To ensure the client remains in a state of 'Hyper-arousal' for the duration of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transmutive Release focuses on allowing the nervous system to discharge stored 'fight-or-flight' energy while keeping the client within their 'Window of Tolerance' to prevent re-traumatization."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to the Auric Alignment Protocols for Executive Burnout (Lesson 3), which brainwave state is the 'target bridge' for restoring cognitive function and reducing 'High-Beta' noise?",
            "options": [
                "The Gamma-Delta transition (30-0.5 Hz)",
                "The Alpha-Theta bridge (8-12 Hz to 4-7 Hz)",
                "The High-Beta peak (20-30 Hz)",
                "The Infra-low frequency (below 0.1 Hz)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Alpha-Theta bridge is critical for burnout recovery as it facilitates the transition from active stress (Beta) to deep relaxation and subconscious processing, allowing the prefrontal cortex to 'offload' cognitive fatigue."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In Palliative Care (Lesson 4), the 'Gentle Resonance Method' dictates that the facilitator should prioritize which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Large, 38-inch Earth Gongs played at high intensity",
                "Subtle, low-amplitude frequencies and 'Near-Field' resonance with soft mallets",
                "Rapid, rhythmic drumming to increase the client's heart rate",
                "Using only high-pitched, 528Hz crystal pyramids for 'DNA repair'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gentle Resonance Method prioritizes the fragility of the client's system, using low-amplitude and soft resonance to provide comfort without overstimulating a sensitive or failing nervous system."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "For clients in Substance Recovery (Lesson 5), the 'Neural Reset' protocol utilizes sound to help regulate which neurotransmitter system often depleted by chronic substance use?",
            "options": [
                "The Cortisol-Adrenaline pathway",
                "The GABA-Glutamate balance and Dopaminergic pathways",
                "The Insulin-Glucagon cycle",
                "The Melatonin-Thyroxine exchange"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sound therapy in recovery aims to restore the GABA-Glutamate balance (calming the nervous system) and support dopamine regulation to mitigate the 'anhedonia' (inability to feel pleasure) common in early sobriety."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Cellular Frequency Tuning' for Autoimmune Disorders. What is the biological mechanism by which sound may reduce systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "By physically shaking cytokines out of the bloodstream",
                "By stimulating the Vagus Nerve to activate the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway",
                "By increasing the acidity of the interstitial fluid",
                "By temporarily stopping the heart's rhythm to 'reset' the immune system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency sound and vibration can stimulate the Vagus Nerve, which in turn triggers the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "During a 'Sonic Induction' session for Anxiety (Lesson 7), a client begins to exhibit signs of a panic attack. What is the standard safety protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the volume of the instruments to 'drown out' the anxiety",
                "Immediately cease all sound and use grounding verbal cues to bring the client back to the present",
                "Switch to a high-pitched tuning fork held directly to the client's ear",
                "Tell the other participants to ignore the client so the session can continue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount; the facilitator must stop the stimulus (sound) and use grounding techniques (tactile or verbal) to stabilize the client and prevent a full panic escalation."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "The 'RESONATE' Method for Collective Trauma (Lesson 8) uses 'Entrainment Scaling.' This is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "Teaching every participant how to play a crystal bowl simultaneously",
                "Using a rhythmic foundation to synchronize the collective Heart Rate Variability (HRV) of the group",
                "Scaling the volume to reach at least 110 decibels to ensure everyone hears it",
                "Providing individual headphones to every person in the community"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment Scaling in group settings focuses on using rhythmic, low-frequency anchors to bring the group's autonomic nervous systems into a shared state of coherence or 'social engagement.'"

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 1 involves a client with chronic back pain. Why might a 40Hz vibroacoustic frequency be more effective than a 440Hz tone for this specific condition?",
            "options": [
                "40Hz is the frequency of 'Universal Love'",
                "Low frequencies (like 40Hz) provide mechanoreceptor stimulation that can 'gate' pain signals at the spinal cord",
                "440Hz is known to be toxic to human cells",
                "Low frequencies travel faster than high frequencies through the air"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Based on the Gate Control Theory of Pain, low-frequency vibrations stimulate large-diameter nerve fibers (mechanoreceptors), which can inhibit the transmission of pain signals from smaller-diameter fibers."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 2's case study on C-PTSD, a facilitator notices a client's eyelids fluttering rapidly and their breathing becoming shallow. According to the Transmutive Release protocol, this indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The client has reached a state of 'Samadhi' or enlightenment",
                "The client is entering a 'Hyper-arousal' state and may be approaching an abreaction",
                "The client is falling into a deep, restorative REM sleep",
                "The instruments are out of tune and need to be replaced"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid eyelid fluttering and shallow breathing are physiological markers of sympathetic nervous system activation (Hyper-arousal), signaling that the client is moving toward the edge of their Window of Tolerance."
