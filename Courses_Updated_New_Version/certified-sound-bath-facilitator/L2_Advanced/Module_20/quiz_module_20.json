            "question": "During Advanced Resonance Scanning (L1), a practitioner feels a 'void' or 'hollow' sensation when passing the hand over the solar plexus. According to the protocol, this most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "An area of energetic congestion or excess",
                "A 'Kyo' state or energetic deficiency/depletion",
                "A healthy, balanced resonance",
                "The presence of a physical inflammatory response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In resonance scanning, 'hollow' or 'cool' sensations typically correlate with 'Kyo' (deficiency), whereas 'dense' or 'pushing' sensations correlate with 'Jitsu' (excess)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Words like 'weight,' 'shoulders,' and 'stuck' are kinesthetic predicates, indicating the client processes their emotional state through physical sensations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is a somatic experiencing technique that prevents overwhelm by moving the client's attention between areas of ease and areas of tension."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Alpha-Theta crossover is a key metric in bio-feedback that signals the transition from relaxed wakefulness into a deep meditative or hypnagogic state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Jitsu represents 'fullness' or 'excess,' which manifests as tension, hardness, or over-activity in the corresponding meridian or chakra area."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EEG is the most direct tool for assessing cognitive states like brain fog, as it can identify if the client is 'stuck' in high-beta (anxiety) or excessive low-alpha (dissociation)."
