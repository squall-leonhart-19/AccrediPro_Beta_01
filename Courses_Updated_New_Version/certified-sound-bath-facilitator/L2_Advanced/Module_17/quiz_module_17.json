            "question": "A client begins to exhibit signs of a somatic abreaction, such as rapid breathing and trembling, during a high-intensity gong sequence. What is your immediate priority?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the volume to help them 'break through' the emotional block",
                "Stop the sound immediately and ask the client to describe their trauma",
                "Gently reduce the sound intensity and use grounding techniques to bring the client back to the present moment",
                "Ignore the reaction as it is a natural part of the healing process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In trauma-informed sound work, the priority is safety and stabilization. Grounding techniques help the client return to their 'Window of Tolerance' without forced catharsis."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "For a client suffering from central sensitization (chronic pain), which sound application is most likely to be therapeutic without causing a pain flare-up?",
            "options": [
                "High-frequency, sharp percussion instruments",
                "Low-frequency, consistent vibrations from a Himalayan bowl or Monochord",
                "Rapid, unpredictable rhythmic changes",
                "Loud, sudden gong strikes to distract from the pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency, consistent vibrations help soothe the nervous system and avoid the 'wind-up' effect often seen in central sensitization and chronic pain syndromes."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "When facilitating a sound bath for neurodivergent individuals (Autism/ADHD), what is the benefit of providing a 'Sensory Menu' beforehand?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the facilitator to charge more for specialized services",
                "It helps the client predict sensory input, reducing anxiety and preventing sensory overload",
                "It ensures that only 'calm' instruments are used during the session",
                "It is a legal requirement for all sound therapy sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Predictability is key for many neurodivergent individuals. A sensory menu allows them to prepare for the types of sounds they will experience, reducing the 'startle' response."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "In palliative care, sound therapy during the 'active dying' phase is primarily used to:",
            "options": [
                "Improve physical mobility and muscle tone",
                "Induce a state of high-beta alertness for final conversations",
                "Facilitate terminal agitation and increase heart rate",
                "Support the 'letting go' process and provide comfort through entrainment to slower rhythms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In end-of-life care, the focus shifts from 'healing' in a curative sense to providing peace, reducing terminal agitation, and supporting a dignified transition."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Why is sound therapy particularly effective for individuals in early recovery from Substance Use Disorder (SUD)?",
            "options": [
                "It provides a chemical high that replaces the drug of choice",
                "It helps regulate a dysregulated HPA axis and provides a safe way to experience altered states of consciousness",
                "It eliminates the need for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)",
                "It guarantees that the individual will not relapse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sound therapy helps re-regulate the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, which is often dysregulated in addiction, and offers a 'sober' way to experience deep relaxation."

            "options": [
                "A complex, multi-tonal gong wash",
                "A weighted blanket or a physical grounding object like a stone",
                "A guided visualization of a vast, empty space",
                "Encouraging them to close their eyes tighter and focus on the sound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physical anchors like weighted blankets or grounding objects provide proprioceptive input that helps stabilize the nervous system during a panic attack."

            "options": [
                "Only play at the lowest volume to ensure no one is offended",
                "Tell the sensitive client they should have booked a private session instead",
                "Use 'zoning' (placing sensitive clients further from loud instruments) and maintain a moderate, balanced volume",
                "Alternate between extreme loudness and extreme silence every 5 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing group dynamics involves proactive 'zoning' and maintaining a middle-ground intensity that serves the majority while protecting the most sensitive participants."

            "question": "A client tells you they are stopping their prescribed anti-depressants because your sound baths 'make them feel better.' What is your correct response regarding Scope of Practice?",
            "options": [
                "Congratulate them on their progress and support their decision",
                "Advise them to switch to a herbal supplement instead",
                "Clearly state that you are not a medical professional and they must consult their prescribing doctor before making changes to medication",
                "Tell them that sound therapy is more effective than medication in the long run"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sound facilitators must never give medical advice or endorse the cessation of prescribed medication. This is a critical boundary of professional scope of practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal is characterized by an overactive sympathetic nervous system, resulting in fight-or-flight symptoms and emotional flooding."

            "question": "When working with a client who has a physical disability that prevents them from lying on the floor, what is the best approach?",
            "options": [
                "Insist they try the floor to get the full 'vibrational' effect",
                "Cancel the session as sound baths are designed for floor-based relaxation",
                "Provide a comfortable chair or allow them to remain in their wheelchair, ensuring they have the same access to the sound field",
                "Only play small hand-held instruments near their ears"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
