            "question": "To induce a deep Theta brainwave state (6Hz) using precision binaural generation, if the carrier frequency in the left ear is set to 210Hz, what must the frequency in the right ear be?",
            "options": ["204Hz", "216Hz", "210Hz", "Both A and B are correct"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Binaural beats are created by the mathematical difference between two frequencies; 210-204=6Hz and 216-210=6Hz. Both would result in a 6Hz Theta entrainment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the context of Complex Harmonic Layering, what is a 'Tartini Tone' (Difference Tone)?",
            "options": ["A physical vibration felt in the chest during gong play", "A third frequency perceived by the brain when two loud, sustained notes are played simultaneously", "The highest possible overtone produced by a crystal bowl", "A specific mallet technique used in clinical settings"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Tartini Tone is a psychoacoustic phenomenon where the ear perceives a third frequency that is the difference between two primary frequencies being played polyphonically."

        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Clinical vibroacoustic research (e.g., Bartel et al.) suggests that which frequency range is most effective for stimulating mechanoreceptors to alleviate symptoms of Fibromyalgia and chronic pain?",
            "options": ["10Hz - 20Hz", "30Hz - 60Hz", "100Hz - 150Hz", "440Hz - 528Hz"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 30Hz - 60Hz range is the 'sweet spot' for vibroacoustic therapy, as it aligns with the resonance of major muscle groups and mechanoreceptor sensitivity."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "During an Advanced Resonance Scan (Biofield Mapping), a facilitator notices a 'metallic, harsh' timbre change in the singing bowl as it passes over the client's liver area. This typically indicates:",
            "options": ["The bowl is cracked or damaged", "An area of high 'energetic density' or inflammation", "The client is in a deep state of relaxation", "A 'void' or depletion in the biofield"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In biofield mapping, harsh or dissonant feedback from the instrument often correlates with areas of physical or emotional 'density' or acute inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Which interval is utilized in 'Therapeutic Interval Theory' to intentionally create tension (dissonance) for the purpose of triggering a 'cathartic release' before resolving to a Perfect Fifth?",
            "options": ["Major Third", "Minor Sixth", "The Tritone (Augmented Fourth)", "Perfect Fourth"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Tritone is the most dissonant interval; in advanced clinical sound work, it is used to surface suppressed tension before resolving it into a consonant interval like the Perfect Fifth."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "When utilizing friction mallets (flumis) on a symphonic gong to create ethereal soundscapes, what is the primary risk of 'over-driving' the instrument?",
            "options": ["The gong may crack due to heat", "The sound may trigger a 'Startle Response,' ejecting the client from the Window of Tolerance", "The overtones will become too low to hear", "The friction will damage the mallet's silicone coating"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In trauma-informed care, over-driving the gong can create 'acoustic flooding,' which triggers the sympathetic nervous system and causes a startle response."

        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "In Environmental Psychoacoustics, a 'Room Mode' or 'Standing Wave' in a square room typically results in which auditory problem?",
            "options": ["The sound becomes too bright and piercing", "Certain bass frequencies disappearing or becoming overwhelmingly loud in specific spots", "The instruments sounding out of tune with each other", "A complete loss of binaural perception"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Room modes are low-frequency standing waves that create 'nodes' (silence) and 'antinodes' (excessive volume) for specific bass frequencies based on room dimensions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "According to sequencing protocols for clinical outcomes, why is the 'Integration Phase' (silence) at the end of a session considered the most 'active' part of the therapy?",
            "options": ["Because the facilitator is cleaning the instruments", "It allows the brain to move from the Frequency Following Response back to Homeostasis", "It is when the client is most likely to fall asleep", "It is when the binaural beats are at their highest frequency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Silence Anchor' allows the nervous system to integrate the shifts in brainwave activity and return to a stable, waking state (homeostasis)."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module showed that sound baths utilizing 'Complex Harmonic Layering' resulted in a mean reduction of salivary cortisol by what percentage?",
            "options": ["5%", "12%", "28%", "65%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that structured, complex sound therapy can reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) by approximately 25-30%, with 28% being the specific mean in recent clinical trials."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "When applying a weighted 128Hz Tuning Fork directly to the Vagus Nerve pathway (near the clavicle), what is the specific clinical objective?",
            "options": ["To increase the client's heart rate", "To stimulate the Parasympathetic Nervous System and increase Heart Rate Variability (HRV)", "To break up calcium deposits in the joints", "To induce a Gamma brainwave state"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Direct vibroacoustic application to the Vagus Nerve area is designed to trigger the 'Rest and Digest' system, measurable through an increase in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)."
