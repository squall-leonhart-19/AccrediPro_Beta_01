            "question": "When a participant enters a state of 'Hyperarousal' during a sound bath, which physiological markers are most likely to be observed during a Crisis Resonance Scan?",
            "options": [
                "Slow, rhythmic breathing and closed eyes with REM",
                "Rapid, shallow breathing, muscle tension, and dilated pupils",
                "Decreased heart rate and limp muscle tone",
                "Excessive yawning and heavy limb sensations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperarousal is characterized by the sympathetic nervous system's 'fight or flight' response, manifesting as increased respiratory rate, pupil dilation, and muscular bracing."

            "options": [
                "The 15-minute period at the start of a session where the brain is most receptive",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance (coined by Dr. Dan Siegel) is the zone where a participant can effectively integrate and process the sonic experience without slipping into hyper-arousal or hypo-arousal."

                "Increase the volume of high-pitched singing bowls to mask the sound",
                "Immediately stop all sound and turn on the overhead lights",

                "Perform an energetic clearing over the participant using a rattle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sonic First Aid for flooding requires stabilizing the participant by removing harmonically complex 'trigger' sounds and providing a predictable, low-frequency 'anchor' to encourage grounding."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex physical cases like terminal illness, the focus shifts from 'transformation' to 'palliative support,' prioritizing pain management, anxiety reduction (anxiolytic effect), and comfort."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent individuals often experience Sensory Overresponsivity (SOR), where the complex, unpredictable harmonics of a gong can be perceived as painful or overwhelming rather than relaxing."

                "A psychological loop that can only be broken by silent meditation",
                "A physical cycle where pain causes muscle tension, which causes more pain; sound breaks it via the relaxation response",
                "A theory that pain is purely vibrational and can be canceled out by 'anti-noise'",
                "The process of pain moving from the left hemisphere to the right hemisphere of the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sound helps break the Pain-Spasm-Pain cycle by inducing the parasympathetic response, which reduces muscular tension and lowers the perception of pain signals sent to the brain."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 24-hour check-in is a safety protocol to ensure the participant has stabilized after a crisis and to offer professional referrals if the 'flooding' indicates a need for clinical support."
