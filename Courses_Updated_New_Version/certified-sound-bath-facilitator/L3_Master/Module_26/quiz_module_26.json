            "question": "When architecting a 6-week 'Therapeutic Arc' for stress recovery, what is the primary objective of the 'Stabilization Phase' (Weeks 1-2)?",
            "options": [
                "Inducing deep cathartic emotional release through high-intensity gong strikes",
                "Establishing the 'Sonic Container' and building the client's capacity for parasympathetic dominance",
                "Integrating future-self visualizations with fast-tempo binaural beats",
                "Testing the client's threshold for cognitive dissonance using dissonant intervals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The initial phase of a multi-session arc must focus on safety and stabilization, ensuring the client's nervous system can handle deeper work in later sessions."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In Niche Program Design for 'Peak Performance,' which sonic strategy is most effective for inducing a 'Flow State' (Alpha-Theta border)?",
            "options": [
                "Using 8-12Hz isochronic tones with steady, rhythmic percussion at 60-70 BPM",
                "Randomizing frequencies to prevent the brain from habituating to the sound",
                "Utilizing extremely low-frequency (sub-30Hz) gongs exclusively",
                "Maintaining a silent environment for 45 minutes followed by a single loud chime"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Flow states are associated with the Alpha-Theta bridge; steady rhythmic entrainment at 60-70 BPM helps anchor the brain in this frequency range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "What is the 'Frequency Following Response' (FFR) and how is it applied in Advanced Sonic Sequencing?",
            "options": [
                "The tendency of the facilitator to follow the client's vocal pitch",
                "The biological phenomenon where brainwave frequencies synchronize to the periodic stimulus of an external sound",
                "The physical vibration of the floor following a heavy mallet strike",
                "A marketing technique where pricing follows the frequency of local competitors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FFR is the mechanism behind entrainment, where the brain 'matches' the frequency of the acoustic stimuli provided by the facilitator."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "When integrating Somatic Experiencing (SE) into a sound program, what does the 'Pendulation' technique involve?",

                "Swinging a crystal pendulum over the client's chakras",
                "Moving the sound bowls physically around the client in a circular motion",
                "Guiding the client to shift attention between a 'resource' (internal safety) and a 'vortex' (area of tension) while sounds provide support",
                "Varying the volume of the instruments from extremely quiet to extremely loud"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is a somatic technique that helps clients process trauma by moving between states of regulation and slight activation without becoming overwhelmed."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "In the design of a 3-day 'Immersive Retreat,' what is the primary cause of 'Sonic Fatigue' among participants?",
            "options": [
                "Using too many different types of instruments in one session",
                "Over-exposure to high-decibel, high-frequency sounds without sufficient 'integration silence'",
                "The facilitator playing for less than 3 hours per day",
                "A lack of variety in the musical scales used during the retreat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intensives require careful 'dosage' of sound; without adequate silence and integration time, the nervous system can become over-stimulated or 'numbed' to the therapeutic effect."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson L6, which quantitative metric provides the most objective data regarding a client's shift from Sympathetic to Parasympathetic dominance?",

                "Self-reported 'Relaxation Score' on a scale of 1-10",

                "Measurement of the client's skin temperature using an infrared thermometer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV is the gold standard for measuring autonomic nervous system balance; an increase in the HF band typically indicates increased vagal tone and parasympathetic activation."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "A facilitator transitions from 'Per-Session' pricing to 'Value-Based' program enrollment. What is the most effective way to communicate this value to a prospective client?",
            "options": [
                "Listing every instrument that will be used in the 8-week program",
                "Focusing on the 'Transformation' (e.g., 'From Chronic Insomnia to Restful Sleep') rather than the number of hours of sound",
                "Offering a 50% discount if they pay in cash",
                "Comparing their hourly rate to a local massage therapist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the outcome and the emotional/physical ROI for the client, rather than trading time for money."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "What is the ethical responsibility of a facilitator when a client experiences an 'Abreaction' (intense emotional/trauma release) during a session?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop all sound and turn on the overhead lights",
                "Increase the volume of the instruments to 'clear' the energy faster",
                "Maintain a grounded presence, use grounding instruments (like a drum), and stay within scope of practice by providing a safe container without attempting deep psychological analysis",
                "Record the session to show the client their progress later"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical stewardship involves holding a safe space and using grounding techniques without overstepping into clinical psychotherapy unless licensed to do so."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "In a 2023 pilot study (referenced in L6), participants in a structured 4-week sound program showed what average improvement in 'Sleep Efficiency' compared to a control group?",
            "options": [
                "5%",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Structured programs consistently outperform single sessions, with studies showing approximately a 34% improvement in objective sleep metrics over a 4-week arc."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "To ensure facilitator longevity and prevent burnout (L8), what is the recommended 'Session-to-Self-Care' ratio?",
            "options": [
                "1 hour of personal practice for every 10 hours of facilitation",
                "Self-care is only necessary if the facilitator feels tired",
                "A 1:1 ratio—one hour of personal restorative practice for every hour of professional facilitation",
                "Facilitators should never practice on themselves to avoid 'energetic contamination'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longevity in sound work requires high levels of personal regulation; a 1:1 ratio ensures the facilitator remains a clear and 'tuned' instrument for their clients."
