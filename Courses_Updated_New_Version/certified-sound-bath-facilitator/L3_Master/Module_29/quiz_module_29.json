            "question": "In the non-linear application of the RESONATE™ framework (L1), why is the 'Recognition' phase considered the master-level anchor?",
            "options": [
                "It dictates the exact musical key that must be played for the entire session.",
                "It allows the facilitator to pivot the session based on real-time energetic feedback rather than a fixed script.",
                "It is the phase where the facilitator sells additional products to the client.",
                "It focuses solely on the physical volume of the instruments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced synthesis requires moving beyond linear scripts. The Recognition phase allows the master facilitator to read the room or client and adapt the intervention dynamically."

            "question": "According to Clinical Somatics (L2), what is the primary indicator that a 'Transmutive Release' is occurring in a client?",
            "options": [
                "The client falling into a deep, snoring sleep.",
                "The client reporting a total lack of sensation in their limbs.",
                "Involuntary micro-tremors, changes in respiratory rate, or temperature fluctuations.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transmutive release involves the discharge of stored somatic tension, often manifesting as autonomic nervous system shifts like tremors or breathing changes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gamma states require faster entrainment and higher frequency precision to stimulate the 'binding' of information across different brain regions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lower frequencies (60Hz-130Hz) have the physical density required to create a sense of 'weight' and 'anchoring' in the physical and energetic body."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level retreats require significant 'processing' time. A 1:1 ratio (50/50) of sound immersion to integration (journaling, sharing, movement) ensures the experience 'sticks'."
