            "question": "When performing Advanced Resonance Scanning (Biofield Mapping), a practitioner detects a 'heavy' or 'sticky' sensation approximately 12-18 inches from the physical body. According to biofield anatomy, which layer is primarily being assessed?",
            "options": [
                "The Physical/Etheric Layer",
                "The Emotional Layer",
                "The Mental Layer",
                "The Ketheric Template"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The emotional layer of the biofield typically extends 8 to 18 inches from the body. Sensations of 'stickiness' or 'density' in this field often correlate with unprocessed emotional data or stagnation."

            "question": "In the context of Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 2), which sound quality is most effective at promoting 'Ventral Vagal' activation and the Social Engagement System?",
            "options": [
                "Sudden, high-frequency percussive strikes",
                "Low-frequency, subsonic rumbling below 40Hz",
                "Prosodic, mid-range frequencies that mimic the human voice",
                "Ultra-high frequency ultrasonic crystal singing pyramids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal complex is attuned to prosodic (melodic) frequencies, particularly those in the range of the human voice, which signal safety and social connection to the nervous system."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "The 'Perfect Fifth' is a cornerstone of Harmonic Geometry. What is the precise mathematical ratio of this interval in Just Intonation, and what is its primary physiological effect?",
            "options": [
                "2:1; triggers deep sleep and Delta brainwaves",
                "3:2; balances the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems",
                "4:3; increases cortisol for morning alertness",
                "1.618; aligns the chakras with the Fibonacci sequence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Perfect Fifth (3:2 ratio) is known as the 'universal interval' of balance, effectively harmonizing the two branches of the autonomic nervous system."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "During a Somatic Trauma Processing session (Lesson 4), a client begins to experience 'flooding' (overwhelming emotional release). Which master-level technique should the practitioner use to bring the client back to a state of safety?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the volume of the gong to mask the client's sounds",
                "Titration: slowing down the input and using grounding, lower-frequency drones",
                "Catharsis: encouraging the client to scream louder to 'get it out'",
                "Silent Stillness: stopping all sound immediately and leaving the room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves breaking down the traumatic release into small, manageable 'doses.' Using grounding, low-frequency drones helps the client pendulate back to a state of safety and regulation."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "When using a 'friction mallet' (flumi) on a large symphonic gong, what is the primary acoustic phenomenon being utilized by the Master Practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Fundamental Frequency suppression",
                "The creation of sustained longitudinal waves and complex overtones",

                "Phase cancellation of the room's natural reverb"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Friction tools like flumis excite the surface of the gong without a percussive strike, allowing for the build-up of complex overtones and sustained longitudinal waves that are difficult to achieve with standard mallets."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Clinical Applications, which modification is MOST critical when facilitating a sound bath for a population with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?",
            "options": [
                "Using only high-pitched crystal bowls to stimulate sensory input",

                "Requiring all participants to lie perfectly still for 60 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with ASD often have sensory processing sensitivities. Predictability, gradual transitions, and avoiding 'startle' responses (sudden loud sounds) are essential for clinical safety and efficacy."

            "id": "q24_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner projects their own emotions, past experiences, or roles (like being a parent) onto the client."

                "Raising the price of group sound baths by $5",
                "Moving from a 'time-for-money' model to 'transformation-based' packages and retreats",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level business strategy involves moving away from hourly rates toward high-value, transformation-focused offerings like immersive retreats or multi-month therapeutic containers."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client in a sound bath becomes very still, their breathing becomes shallow, and they report feeling 'numb' or 'checked out' afterward. Which Polyvagal state were they likely inhabiting?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Safety)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown/Dissociation)",
                "The Flow State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is a primitive defense mechanism characterized by immobilization, numbness, and dissociation when the system perceives a threat it cannot escape."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "The Golden Ratio (1.618), or 'Phi,' is applied in sound therapy primarily through:",

                "The timing of intervals and the placement of 'peaks' in a session's arc",
                "The exact number of bowls used (always 1.618 bowls)",
                "Striking the gong only 1.6 times per minute",
                "The distance the practitioner stands from the client (exactly 1.618 meters)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners use the Golden Ratio to structure the 'Golden Thread' of a session, often placing the most intense or transformative 'peak' at the 61.8% mark of the total session duration."
