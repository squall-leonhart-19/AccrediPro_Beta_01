            "question": "During the 'Resonance Scan' (L1), a facilitator identifies a 'hot spot' characterized by intense, erratic energy over the solar plexus. What does this typically indicate in a clinical sound therapy context?",
            "options": [
                "An energetic void or depletion requiring immediate high-frequency input",
                "Hyper-arousal or sympathetic dominance in that specific energetic center",
                "A state of deep physical relaxation and parasympathetic repair",
                "The successful completion of the grounding phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hot spots usually represent areas of hyper-arousal, inflammation, or 'stuck' sympathetic energy that requires intervention to balance."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "When establishing 'Collaborative Healing Objectives' (L2), why is the use of a 'Sankalpa' considered more effective than a vague goal like 'feeling better'?",
            "options": [
                "It provides a specific, present-tense resolve that directs the focus of the sonic entrainment",
                "It is a mandatory legal requirement for sound bath facilitators",
                "It allows the facilitator to charge a higher premium for the session",
                "It prevents the client from falling asleep during the induction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Sankalpa acts as a directional force for the energy, aligning the client's intention with the frequencies being produced."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "In the 'Sonic Induction' phase (L3), which brainwave state is the primary target for achieving a 'bridge' between the conscious and subconscious mind?",
            "options": [
                "Beta (13–30 Hz)",
                "Alpha (8–12 Hz)",
                "Theta (4–8 Hz)",
                "Gamma (30–100 Hz)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta is the state of deep meditation and REM sleep, where profound healing and subconscious processing occur while maintaining a thread of awareness."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "According to the principles of 'Oscillating Frequencies' (L4), what is the purpose of introducing controlled 'Sonic Dissonance'?",
            "options": [
                "To make the client feel uncomfortable enough to leave",
                "To mask outside noises like traffic or air conditioning",
                "To destabilize rigid, stagnant energetic patterns so they can reorganize into a more coherent state",
                "To test the durability of the crystal bowls"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dissonance creates a 'pattern interrupt' in the biofield, breaking up energetic stagnation that has become too rigid."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A 'Neural Reset' (L5) is considered successful when the client shows signs of 'Parasympathetic Dominance.' Which physiological data point supports this?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "An increase in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "An increase in respiratory rate to 20 breaths per minute",
                "A sudden spike in blood glucose levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Higher HRV is a primary indicator of parasympathetic nervous system activity and the body's ability to recover from stress."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "During 'Auric Alignment' (L6), why are high-frequency tools (like tingshas or small bells) used specifically in the outer layers of the biofield?",
            "options": [
                "Because high frequencies have longer wavelengths that travel further",
                "Because high frequencies have shorter wavelengths that interact more effectively with the subtle, fast-vibrating energy of the outer aura",
                "Because low frequencies are too loud for the outer aura",
                "Because the outer aura is physically made of metal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The outer layers of the biofield vibrate at higher velocities; high-frequency instruments provide the necessary resonance to clear and align these subtle layers."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In 'Transmutive Release' (L7), a client experiences a 'Somatic Release' (uncontrollable shaking). What is the facilitator's primary responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "To stop the sound immediately and call for medical assistance",
                "To increase the volume of the gong to suppress the shaking",
                "To maintain a stable 'sonic container' and provide a grounded presence for the client to process the release",
                "To ask the client to leave the room so they do not disturb others"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Facilitators must hold space and maintain the sonic environment, allowing the nervous system to complete the discharge of stored trauma (somatic experiencing)."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "What is the primary function of 'Earth Grounding' (L8) at the conclusion of a high-intensity sound session?",
            "options": [
                "To wake the client up as quickly as possible",
                "To anchor the shifts made in the subtle bodies back into the physical body and reality",
                "To clear the room for the next scheduled group",
                "To ensure the client can drive home without feeling any effects of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding ensures the 'integration' phase is complete, bringing the client's expanded awareness back into a functional, physical state."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Which instrument combination is most effective for L8 (Earth Grounding)?",
            "options": [
                "Crystal pyramids and high-pitched chimes",
                "Monochords and vocal toning in the soprano range",
                "Large Himalayan bowls (low C or D) and heavy Earth Gongs",
                "Silence followed by a sudden loud clap"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low frequencies (40Hz-100Hz) provide the physical vibration necessary to stimulate the root chakra and 'anchor' the client."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Research into 'Sonic Induction' (L3) suggests that for 'Frequency Following Response' (entrainment) to occur, the stimulus must usually be consistent for at least:",

                "10 seconds",
                "30 seconds",
                "5 to 8 minutes",
                "60 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The brain typically requires 5 to 8 minutes of consistent rhythmic or harmonic stimulation to fully entrain to a new brainwave frequency."
