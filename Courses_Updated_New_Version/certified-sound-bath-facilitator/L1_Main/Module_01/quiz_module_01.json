            "question": "Which physical principle describes the phenomenon where a vibrating object (like a tuning fork) causes a second object to vibrate at the same frequency without direct contact?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Resonance",
                "Forced Vibration",
                "Acoustic Levitation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sympathetic resonance is the foundational principle of the Resonance Scan, where the facilitator's tools or presence interact with the client's existing frequencies."

                "Exactly 10 inches"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Etheric Body is the innermost layer of the biofield, typically extending 0.5 to 2 inches from the physical body, and is the primary focus for detecting immediate physical disharmony."

            "id": "q1_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic empathy involves the facilitator using their own body as a resonant chamber to mirror and identify the client's physical or energetic blocks."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In the 'Resonance Interview,' what is the primary purpose of observing the 'Prosody' of a client's speech?",
            "options": [
                "To check for grammatical correctness",
                "To determine the client's level of education",
                "To assess the emotional frequency and tonal needs through vocal rhythm and pitch",
                "To time the duration of the sound bath"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prosody (the rhythm and intonation of speech) provides non-verbal clues about a client's energetic state and 'tonal needs' that words alone may miss."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shallow chest breathing is a hallmark of the 'fight or flight' response, indicating the client needs grounding and lower-frequency stabilization."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When scanning the biofield with a Himalayan Singing Bowl, what does a sudden 'fluttering' or 'warbling' sound (beats) usually indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The bowl is high quality",
                "An area of harmonic resonance",
                "A 'dead spot' with no energy",
                "An area of interference or energetic turbulence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A 'warble' or 'beat' occurs when the bowl's frequency meets a dissonant frequency in the client's field, indicating turbulence or a block."

            "id": "q1_7",

            "options": [
                "A rapid increase in volume",
                "A 'dead spot' where the sound decays prematurely or sounds 'flat'",
                "The sound becoming higher in pitch",
                "A pure, clear sine wave"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dense or blocked energy absorbs sound waves rather than reflecting them, causing a 'dead spot' or rapid decay of the instrument's sustain."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Why must the Resonance Scan (R) be performed BEFORE Establishing Intention (E) in the RESONATE™ Method?",
            "options": [
                "Because the scan is the shortest part of the session",
                "To ensure the facilitator is paid before the session starts",
                "To gather objective data so the intention is based on actual needs rather than assumptions",
                "It doesn't matter; the order is interchangeable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'R' provides the diagnostic data required to make the 'E' (Establish Intention) specific, relevant, and effective for the client's current state."

            "id": "q1_9",

            "options": [
                "50%",
                "65%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "88% of clients reported higher satisfaction and feeling 'deeply heard' when facilitators used active listening and vocal prosody assessment."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "During a Diagnostic Scan, you move a tuning fork vertically along the midline. You notice the sound becomes significantly sharper (higher pitch) over the throat. This suggests:",

                "The tuning fork is malfunctioning",
                "Vocal cord inflammation",
                "An area of high-frequency tension or 'over-activity'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a sound becomes 'sharp' or higher in pitch during a scan, it often indicates an area of constriction, tension, or hyper-activity in the biofield."
