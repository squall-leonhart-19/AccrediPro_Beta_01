            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Which specific instrument is considered most effective for 'shattering' crystallized energetic blockages in the mental layer of the aura due to its high-frequency harmonic content?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cold spots or 'dips' in the field usually signal energy depletion, leakage, or a void that requires 'filling' with resonant sound rather than clearing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sealing the field requires grounding the client. Low frequencies (like 174 Hz or deep Himalayan bowls) at the feet help 'anchor' the energy and close the auric boundary."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. Flow, Auric Alignment follows the initial relaxation/opening phase to prepare the client's subtle bodies for the deeper tonal immersion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For 'scattered' energy and auric static, using a high-frequency instrument like a Koshi chime to 'comb' the field helps reorganize the chaotic energy patterns and restore alignment."
