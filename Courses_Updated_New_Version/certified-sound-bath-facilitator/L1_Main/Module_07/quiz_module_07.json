            "question": "In the philosophy of Transmutive Release, what is the primary difference between 'catharsis' and 'suppression'?",
            "options": [
                "Suppression focuses on the physical body, while catharsis focuses on the mind.",
                "Catharsis involves the active processing and transformation of energy, whereas suppression temporarily masks symptoms.",
                "Suppression is a faster route to healing than catharsis.",
                "Catharsis requires silence, while suppression requires loud sound."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transmutive release (catharsis) seeks to move and transform stuck emotional energy, while suppression simply pushes the emotion deeper into the somatic tissue."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to the neuro-acoustic principles in Lesson 2, which brain structure's activity is typically down-regulated by low-frequency 'safety signals' to allow emotional release?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala, the brain's fear center, must be down-regulated through consistent, predictable sound patterns to allow the nervous system to feel safe enough for emotional release."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A client begins experiencing 'neurogenic tremors' (rapid, involuntary shaking) during a deep gong session. Based on Lesson 3, how should the facilitator interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign of a seizure that requires immediate medical intervention.",
                "As a somatic marker indicating the discharge of stored autonomic nervous system tension.",
                "As a sign that the sound volume is too high and causing physical pain.",
                "As a lack of magnesium in the client's diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurogenic tremors are a natural somatic marker indicating that the body is releasing stored 'fight-or-flight' energy from the nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the release process so that the client is not overwhelmed, ensuring they stay within their window of tolerance."

            "question": "Which sonic tool is described in Lesson 5 as being most effective for 'breaking up' stagnant energy in the biofield due to its complex, non-linear harmonic structure?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gongs produce non-linear, complex harmonics that create a 'sonic envelope,' which is highly effective at disrupting stagnant emotional patterns."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vocal toning creates internal vibration that mechanically stimulates the Vagus nerve, particularly through the throat and chest, promoting a parasympathetic response."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A 'Healing Crisis' is a temporary spike in symptoms (physical or emotional) as the body processes and detoxifies released energy and tension."

            "question": "During the 'Transition to Grounding' (Lesson 8), why is it recommended to use 'Earth' element instruments like drums or low-frequency Himalayan bowls?",
            "options": [
                "To wake the clients up so they leave the studio faster.",
                "To provide a 'Parasympathetic Bridge' that anchors the expanded state back into physical reality.",
                "To mask the sound of other clients moving.",
                "Because high frequencies are dangerous at the end of a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency, rhythmic instruments help anchor the client back into their physical body, facilitating the 'integration' of the emotional work they just completed."

                "Play the instruments louder to 'clear' the panic.",
                "Immediately stop all sound and turn on the bright lights.",
                "Ground the sound (lower volume/frequency) and offer a stabilizing focal point, like the breath or a weighted blanket.",
                "Tell the client they are doing a great job and to keep crying."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The priority is to help the client return to their window of tolerance by grounding the sonic environment and providing stabilizing sensory input."

            "options": [
                "A decrease in HRV, indicating a focused mind.",
                "An increase in HRV, indicating improved autonomic nervous system flexibility.",
                "No change in HRV, as sound only affects the brain.",
                "A total cessation of heart rate fluctuations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Higher HRV is a marker of a resilient, healthy nervous system. Successful sound-based release typically shifts the body into a state of higher autonomic flexibility."
