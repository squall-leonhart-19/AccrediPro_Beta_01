            "question": "A client asks you to use sound therapy to 'cure' their clinical depression. According to the Professional Ethics and Scope of Practice (L1), what is the most appropriate response?",
            "options": [
                "Agree to treat the depression specifically using high-frequency crystal bowls.",
                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional while offering sound as a complementary, supportive tool.",
                "Tell the client that sound therapy is a replacement for their current medication.",
                "Ignore the request and focus only on the physical vibrations of the instruments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Facilitators must stay within their scope of practice, which involves providing complementary wellness support rather than diagnosing or treating clinical conditions."

            "question": "During the 'Resonance Scan' (R) phase (L2), what is the facilitator primarily looking for when moving an instrument around the client's body?",
            "options": [
                "The client's favorite musical note.",
                "Areas of 'sonic dissonance' or 'dead spots' that indicate energetic depletion or congestion.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Resonance Scan is used to identify areas in the biofield or physical body where the sound changes, indicating potential energetic blockages or imbalances."

            "options": [
                "Because the facilitator should not have any input in the session.",
                "To ensure the facilitator can charge a higher premium for the session.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-creation ensures the client is an active participant in their healing process, which aligns their psychological intention with the physiological effects of the sound."

            "options": [
                "The tendency of the brain to internalize the rhythm and frequency of an external stimulus.",
                "The speed at which sound travels through water compared to air.",
                "The client's ability to sing back the note played by the facilitator.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "FFR is the mechanism where the brain's internal rhythms synchronize with the external frequency of the sound instruments."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "The 'O' and 'N' phases (L5) focus on 'Oscillating Frequencies' and 'Nurturing.' What is the primary benefit of using oscillating (wavering) tones?",
            "options": [
                "They are easier for the facilitator to play for long periods.",
                "They prevent the brain from habituating to a static sound, encouraging deeper somatic release.",
                "They are used exclusively for the Crown Chakra.",
                "They decrease the volume of the sound bath to ensure safety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oscillation creates a dynamic soundscape that prevents 'sensory adaptation,' keeping the nervous system engaged and facilitating the release of physical tension."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is a key trauma-informed principle that ensures the healing process happens in small increments that the client can safely integrate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grounding requires low frequencies and somatic focus to help the client transition from a meditative 'theta' state back into 'beta' or waking consciousness."
