            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "During a 'Resonance Scan' (L1), what is the primary indicator that the practitioner has identified an area of energetic dissonance?",
            "options": [
                "The instrument produces a brighter, louder tone",
                "The sound 'deadens' or the overtones become muddy and flat",
                "The client begins to laugh uncontrollably",
                "The instrument physically vibrates out of the practitioner's hand"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a Resonance Scan, areas of stagnation or dissonance often cause the sound to 'sink' or lose its harmonic richness, indicating a need for focused frequency application."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Blueprint of Healing' (L2), how does the practitioner's intent mathematically influence the session outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Intent has no measurable effect on frequency",
                "Intent acts as a carrier wave, directing the coherent frequency to specific physiological targets",
                "Intent only matters if the client is also a trained musician",
                "Intent doubles the decibel level of the singing bowls"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intent is the 'blueprint' that organizes the sound waves; without a clear directive, the frequency lacks the coherence required for targeted healing."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "To facilitate 'Sonic Induction' (L3) into a Theta state (4–8 Hz), which acoustic technique is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, erratic changes in volume and pitch",
                "High-frequency dissonance above 10,000 Hz",
                "Monotonic rhythmic entrainment and steady binaural intervals",
                "Complete silence followed by a sudden loud gong strike"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta states are induced through steady, rhythmic entrainment that encourages the brain to slow its dominant frequency to match the sonic pulse."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, how do 'Oscillating Frequencies' break through physical and energetic stagnation?",
            "options": [
                "By creating a 'vibrational vacuum' that sucks out toxins",
                "By introducing varying wave patterns that prevent the cells from remaining in a fixed, rigid state",
                "By heating the body's core temperature by 5 degrees",
                "By temporarily paralyzing the muscles to allow for sound penetration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oscillation prevents 'habituation' and uses varied vibrational patterns to shake loose stagnation that has become 'stuck' in a single frequency signature."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which physiological marker is the most reliable evidence of a 'Neural Reset' (L5) into the parasympathetic response?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "A decrease in skin temperature",
                "An increase in blood pressure",
                "Rapid, shallow thoracic breathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Higher HRV is a direct clinical indicator of parasympathetic dominance and a healthy, resilient nervous system response to sound therapy."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "When performing 'Auric Alignment' (L6), the practitioner works primarily within which distance from the physical body?",
            "options": [
                "0 inches (direct skin contact only)",
                "2 to 12 inches (the subtle energy field)",
                "5 to 10 feet away",
                "The practitioner should stay in a different room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Auric' or subtle energy field is most accessible and influential within the 2-12 inch range surrounding the biological body."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "During 'Transmutive Release' (L7), a client experiences 'Somatic Processing' such as sighing or twitching. What is the recommended practitioner response?",
            "options": [
                "Stop the session immediately and call for medical help",
                "Increase the volume to drown out the client's sounds",
                "Maintain a steady, supportive frequency to allow the nervous system to complete the discharge",
                "Tell the client to remain perfectly still"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic processing is a sign of trauma or energy being released; the practitioner should provide a stable 'sonic container' to support the completion of the release."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of 'Earth Grounding' (L8) at the conclusion of a session?",
            "options": [
                "To make the client feel as 'spacey' as possible",
                "To anchor the expanded state back into physical reality and ensure the client is alert for daily tasks",
                "To drain all the energy out of the client",
                "To prepare the client for a high-intensity workout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding ensures the client integrates the healing and can safely navigate the physical world (e.g., driving home) after an altered state of consciousness."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "In a 2023 study referenced in the module, what percentage of participants reported a significant reduction in 'subjective tension' following a 45-minute sonic induction session?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "42%",
                "Over 80%",
                "98%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data consistently shows that over 80% of participants experience a measurable reduction in perceived tension and anxiety following sound-based induction."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client feels 'uncomfortably lightheaded' after the session. Which L8 grounding technique should be applied?",
            "options": [
                "Playing high-pitched chimes near the crown",
                "Using deep, low-frequency weighted forks or drums near the feet and offering water",
                "Asking the client to stand up and spin in circles",
                "Extending the session by another 30 minutes of high-frequency bowls"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low frequencies and physical anchors (like water or foot-focused sound) help pull the client's awareness back down into the physical body."
