            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "During the 'Resonance Scan' (R) phase, what specific sonic feedback indicates a 'dissonant node' or energetic blockage in the client's field?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in the instrument's sustain",
                "A 'flat' or metallic quality in the tone that lacks harmonic richness",
                "A perfect sympathetic resonance between two bowls",
                "A noticeable drop in the volume of the facilitator's voice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Resonance Scan, blockages often manifest as 'dead' spots where the instrument's tone becomes flat, metallic, or truncated, indicating a lack of flow in the client's biofield."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "The 'Establishing Intent' (E) phase utilizes the 'Observer Effect.' Why is this scientifically relevant to the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. Method™?",
            "options": [
                "It proves that sound waves cannot travel through water",
                "It suggests that the facilitator's focused intention can influence the collapse of the wave function in quantum systems",
                "It ensures the client remains in a high-beta brainwave state",
                "It is only used to help the facilitator remember the client's name"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Method teaches that intention acts as a 'carrier wave' for the sound, utilizing the quantum principle that the observer's focus influences the outcome of the energetic interaction."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In 'Sonic Induction' (S), what is the primary goal of using repetitive, low-frequency intervals?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate the sympathetic nervous system for a 'fight or flight' response",
                "To achieve 'Frequency Following Response' (FFR), moving the brain from Beta to Alpha or Theta states",
                "To increase the client's heart rate to over 100 BPM",
                "To test the acoustic properties of the room's corners"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sonic Induction relies on brainwave entrainment (FFR) to transition the client from active, alert Beta states into deeper, more receptive Alpha and Theta states."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "The 'Oscillating Frequencies' (O) phase uses 'Vibrational Deconstruction.' What is the primary mechanism behind this technique?",

                "Using constructive interference to double the volume of the sound",
                "Creating complex beat frequencies to 'break up' stagnant energetic patterns or 'armor'",
                "Playing only one single note for the duration of the 60-minute session",
                "Using high-pitched whistles to startle the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vibrational Deconstruction uses the friction created by oscillating frequencies and binaural beats to loosen and dissolve stored somatic tension and stagnant energy."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "During the 'Parasympathetic Pivot' (N), which physiological change is a hallmark of a successful 'Neural Reset'?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in pupillary dilation",
                "A shift from thoracic (chest) breathing to diaphragmatic (belly) breathing",
                "A sudden spike in cortisol production",
                "The onset of a shivering response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neural Reset phase is designed to trigger the Vagus nerve, resulting in slower, deeper diaphragmatic breathing and a shift into the parasympathetic 'rest and digest' state."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In 'Field Harmonization' (A), the facilitator works with 'Auric Alignment.' According to the Biofield Science mentioned in the lesson, what is the 'Human Biofield' composed of?",
            "options": [
                "Exclusively heat and sweat",

                "A series of physical tubes that carry sound waves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern biofield science views the 'aura' as a complex electromagnetic and bio-photonic field that regulates biological processes and responds to external vibrational stimuli."

            "options": [
                "Immediately stop all sound and turn on the lights",
                "Maintain a grounding, steady rhythmic pulse to provide a 'sonic container' for the release",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The facilitator must hold space by maintaining a steady, rhythmic 'anchor' that allows the client to process the release safely without feeling abandoned or overwhelmed."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Grounding or 'Earthing' involves the transfer of electrons, which helps stabilize the body's electrical environment and reduce inflammation following the 'up-regulation' of a sound session."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lightheadedness or feeling 'unmoored' after a session is a classic sign of insufficient grounding. The Physical Integration phase is designed to bring the client's awareness back into their physical body."
