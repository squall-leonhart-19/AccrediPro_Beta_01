            "question": "In the context of the Physics and Physiology of sound (L1), what is 'mechanotransduction'?",
            "options": [
                "The process by which the body converts mechanical sound vibrations into electrochemical signals.",
                "The movement of sound through a vacuum.",
                "The psychological interpretation of musical scales.",
                "The physical cleaning of singing bowls to maintain their frequency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mechanotransduction is the physiological process where cells convert mechanical stimuli (sound waves) into electrical activity, which is fundamental to how sound healing affects the cellular level."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "During a 'Resonance Scan' (L2), a facilitator notices a sudden 'deadening' or lack of sustain in a bowl's tone over the client's solar plexus. This most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The bowl is cracked or damaged.",
                "An area of energetic density or 'stagnation' in the client's biofield.",
                "The client is entering a deep Theta brainwave state.",
                "The room's acoustics are absorbing the sound."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In resonance scanning, changes in the instrument's timbre, volume, or sustain often indicate areas of dissonance or stagnation within the client's energetic field."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Why is 'Establishing Intent' (L3) considered a co-creative process in the RESONATE framework?",
            "options": [
                "Because the facilitator chooses the intent for the client.",
                "Because the client must pay extra for the intention-setting phase.",
                "Because it aligns the client's conscious focus with the facilitator's sonic direction to prime the nervous system.",
                "Because intent is only effective if both people use the same instrument."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing intent is co-creative because it requires the client's participation to prime their subconscious, creating a narrative that the sound session then supports through physiological entrainment."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Mastering the 'Alpha-Theta Bridge' (L4) involves guiding the client into which specific frequency range?",
            "options": [
                "30 Hz - 100 Hz (Gamma)",
                "14 Hz - 30 Hz (Beta)",
                "4 Hz - 13 Hz (Alpha-Theta transition)",
                "0.5 Hz - 4 Hz (Delta)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Alpha-Theta bridge occurs between 8-13 Hz (Alpha) and 4-8 Hz (Theta), the state where deep relaxation meets the subconscious dreaming state."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "When using 'Oscillating Frequencies' (L5) to break stagnation, which musical interval is traditionally used to create 'constructive tension' before resolution?",
            "options": [
                "The Perfect Fifth",
                "The Unison",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Tritone creates a sense of dissonance and tension (stagnation breaking) that, when resolved to a consonant interval like a Perfect Fifth, facilitates emotional and physical release."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Neural Reset' (L6) during a sound bath?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the client's heart rate and adrenaline.",
                "To shift the autonomic nervous system from sympathetic dominance to parasympathetic activation.",
                "To prevent the client from falling asleep.",
                "To clear the client's memory of the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural Reset focuses on 'rebooting' the nervous system by activating the parasympathetic response (rest and digest), allowing for systemic healing and auric alignment."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'Transmutive Release' (L7) and begins to weep quietly during the session. What is the best course of action for the facilitator?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the sound to ask if they are okay.",
                "Increase the volume of the gongs to drown out the sound.",
                "Maintain a steady, supportive sonic rhythm and hold 'energetic space' without interrupting the process.",
                "Tell the client to take deep breaths and stop crying."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During somatic catharsis, the facilitator should provide a 'sonic container'—maintaining steady, non-intrusive sound to allow the client to process the emotion safely."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Which frequency is often used in 'Earth Grounding' (L8) because it mimics the Earth's natural electromagnetic resonance?",
            "options": [
                "440 Hz",
                "7.83 Hz (Schumann Resonance)",
                "528 Hz",
                "128 Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Schumann Resonance (7.83 Hz) is the frequency of the Earth's electromagnetic field and is highly effective for grounding and anchoring a client after high-frequency work."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "According to the Module 12 deep dive, if a client feels 'dizzy' or 'spaced out' after a session, which phase of the RESONATE process was likely insufficient?",
            "options": [
                "Resonance Scan (R)",
                "Establish Intent (E)",
                "Sonic Induction (S)",
                "Earth Grounding (E)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Post-session dizziness or feeling 'un-tethered' is a classic sign of insufficient grounding. The final 'E' (Earth Grounding) is required to anchor the transformation back into the physical body."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "The phenomenon where a client's biological rhythms (like heart rate) synchronize with the rhythmic pulse of the crystal bowls is known as:",
            "options": [
                "Entrainment",
                "Echo-location",
                "Somatic Refraction",
                "Sonic Bleed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the physics principle where two oscillating systems synchronize. In sound healing, we use external sound to entrain internal biological rhythms to slower, healing frequencies."
