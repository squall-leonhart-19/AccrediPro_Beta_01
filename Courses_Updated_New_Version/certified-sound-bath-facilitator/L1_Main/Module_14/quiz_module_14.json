            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "During the 'Resonance Scan' (L1), what is the primary objective when a facilitator detects a 'harmonic void' in a client's biofield?",
            "options": [
                "To identify areas of energetic density or depletion that require targeted frequency application.",
                "To immediately play the loudest instrument to 'break' the void.",
                "To stop the session and inform the client they have a medical blockage.",
                "To ignore the void and proceed with a standard sequence regardless of the scan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Resonance Scan is an assessment phase used to identify specific areas of dissonance, density, or depletion (voids) so the facilitator can tailor the subsequent frequencies to the client's unique needs."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the 'Establishing Intent' phase (L2), how does the 'Observer Effect' from quantum physics apply to the sound bath environment?",
            "options": [
                "The client's physical presence changes the pitch of the bowls.",
                "The facilitator's focused intention and the client's receptivity influence the collapse of the wave function into a healing outcome.",
                "Watching the bowls makes them vibrate faster.",
                "The intent only works if the client keeps their eyes open during the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Establishing Intent' phase leverages the psychological and quantum principle that focused intention (the observer) influences the outcome of the energetic field, creating a coherent environment for healing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "During 'Sonic Induction' (L3), which brainwave transition is targeted to move the client from active alertness to a meditative state?",
            "options": [
                "Delta to Gamma",
                "Theta to High Beta",
                "High Beta to Alpha and low Theta",
                "Alpha to High Beta"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sonic Induction uses entrainment to guide the brain from High Beta (active, often stressed thinking) down into Alpha (relaxed) and Theta (deep meditation/REM-like state)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "The 'Oscillating Frequencies' phase (L4) utilizes 'Binaural Beats' and 'Pulsing' primarily to achieve what physiological effect?",
            "options": [
                "To induce sleep within the first 5 minutes.",
                "To create a 'frequency following response' that breaks up patterns of stagnation and physical tension.",
                "To increase the client's heart rate for a cardiovascular workout.",
                "To test the maximum decibel limit of the singing bowls."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oscillation creates a rhythmic variation that encourages the body's systems to entrain, which helps break up stagnant energy and physical tension patterns through the frequency following response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "In the 'Neural Reset' phase (L5), which cranial nerve is the primary target for activating the parasympathetic response?",
            "options": [
                "The Olfactory Nerve (CN I)",
                "The Optic Nerve (CN II)",
                "The Vagus Nerve (CN X)",
                "The Trigeminal Nerve (CN V)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus Nerve is the 'commander-in-chief' of the parasympathetic nervous system; sound frequencies, particularly low-frequency humming or deep tones, stimulate the Vagus nerve to induce a relaxation response."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "When performing 'Auric Alignment' (L6), the facilitator moves instruments through the subtle energy field. What is the recommended distance from the physical body for this clearing?",
            "options": [
                "Directly touching the skin.",
                "Approximately 6 to 18 inches away from the body.",
                "At least 10 feet away in the corner of the room.",
                "Only above the head, never near the feet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The subtle energy field (aura) is most effectively engaged by moving instruments within the 'biofield' range, typically 6 to 18 inches from the physical body, to clear attachments and align the field."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "During 'Transmutive Release' (L7), a client begins to experience 'Somatic Tremors.' What does this indicate in the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. framework?",
            "options": [
                "The client is having a seizure and needs medical intervention.",
                "The room is too cold and the client needs a blanket.",
                "The nervous system is discharging stored trauma or high-arousal energy.",
                "The client is bored and trying to wake themselves up."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic tremors are a natural mechanism for the nervous system to discharge stored 'fight-or-flight' energy or trauma, a key goal of the Transmutive Release phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Earth Grounding' phase (L8) before a client leaves the session?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client is awake enough to drive and has integrated the energetic shifts into their physical body.",
                "To make the client feel heavy so they don't want to leave.",
                "To sell them a grounding mat or crystal.",
                "To restart the entire R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. process from the beginning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Grounding is essential for integration; it anchors the high-vibrational shifts into the physical body and ensures the client is 'present' and safe to return to their daily activities."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study mentioned in the module found that consistent application of 'Neural Reset' frequencies (L5) resulted in a significant increase in Heart Rate Variability (HRV). What does higher HRV signify?",
            "options": [
                "A weakened heart muscle.",
                "Increased stress and anxiety levels.",
                "Better autonomic nervous system flexibility and resilience to stress.",
                "A state of permanent drowsiness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a marker of a healthy, resilient autonomic nervous system that can effectively switch between stress and relaxation states."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "If a client presents with 'Chronic Fatigue' during the initial Resonance Scan, how should the facilitator adjust the 'Oscillating Frequencies' (L4) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Use extremely loud, fast-paced drumming to force energy into them.",
                "Use gentle, low-amplitude oscillations that build slowly to avoid overstimulating an exhausted nervous system.",
                "Skip the oscillation phase entirely to let them sleep.",
                "Play high-pitched crystal bowls at maximum volume for the entire session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients with depleted energy (Chronic Fatigue), overstimulation can lead to a 'healing crisis.' The R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. Method suggests gentle, gradual oscillations to slowly build capacity without overwhelming the system."
