            "question": "In the proprietary RESONATE Method™, what does the 'R' represent, and what is its primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "Relaxation; to induce a parasympathetic state immediately.",
                "Resonance Scan; to assess the client's current energetic state and identify areas of disharmony.",
                "Rhythmic Entrainment; to synchronize the heart rate with the instruments.",
                "Reverberation; to measure the acoustic quality of the healing space."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' stands for Resonance Scan, which is the foundational assessment phase used to identify energetic 'hot spots' or stagnation before treatment begins."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the physics principle where two oscillating systems interact and synchronize, such as a client's brainwaves slowing down to match the rhythm of a Himalayan bowl."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to the anatomy of the human biofield, which layer is located closest to the physical body (0.5 to 2 inches) and typically holds markers for physical vitality and pain?",
            "options": [
                "The Etheric Body",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Etheric Body is the innermost layer of the biofield and is most closely tied to physical sensations and the health of the biological tissues."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "While performing a Resonance Scan with a tuning fork, you hear a sudden 'drop' in volume or a 'thud' sound. What does this clinical marker typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "An area of high energy or inflammation.",
                "An emotional release in progress.",
                "An area of energetic 'void' or depletion/stagnation.",
                "The tuning fork is losing its vibration naturally."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'flat' or 'dull' tone during a scan often indicates an area where energy is stagnant, depleted, or congested, requiring focused 'clearance' work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Which specific frequency is considered the 'Gold Standard' for weighted tuning forks used for grounding and bone conduction in sound therapy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "128 Hz (the Otto Tuner) is the standard for physical application due to its ability to stimulate nitric oxide release and promote deep physical relaxation."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "When distinguishing between physical and emotional disharmony markers, emotional 'static' in the biofield is usually characterized by:",
            "options": [
                "A consistent, heavy pressure felt 1 inch from the skin.",
                "Fluctuating, 'shimmering' or 'sharp' tonal changes further out in the biofield (1-3 feet).",
                "A complete absence of sound from the tuning fork.",
                "A localized increase in temperature near the heart chakra."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional disharmony typically manifests further away from the physical body and presents as inconsistent or 'warbling' frequencies rather than dense stagnation."

                "Mild anxiety",
                "Muscle soreness from exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vibration can potentially dislodge a blood clot in clients with DVT, making it a strict contraindication for direct-contact sound work."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "In trauma-informed care, if a client begins to breathe rapidly and their eyes dart around the room during a loud gong sequence, they are likely experiencing:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyperarousal is characterized by sympathetic nervous system activation, indicating the sound intensity has pushed the client out of their 'Window of Tolerance'."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "To minimize 'standing waves' and acoustic interference in a square-shaped healing room, where is the most effective placement for sound-absorbing materials?",
            "options": [
                "Only on the floor (carpeting).",
                "In the corners of the room and at 'first reflection' points on walls.",
                "Directly behind the facilitator.",
                "On the ceiling only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Corners are where low frequencies (bass) tend to build up, and first reflection points on walls cause the most 'muddy' sound interference."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client arrives for a session and discloses they have a cardiac pacemaker. According to the Professional Standards covered in Lesson 1, how should you proceed?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed as normal; sound frequency does not affect electronics.",
                "Avoid placing any vibrating instruments or strong magnets within 6-12 inches of the device.",
                "Only use high-pitched crystal bowls, as low frequencies are the only risk.",
                "Cancel the session immediately as sound baths are forbidden for pacemaker recipients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While sound baths are generally safe, professional standards dictate a 'safety zone' around electronic implants to prevent electromagnetic or vibrational interference."
