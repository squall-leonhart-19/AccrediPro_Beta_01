            "question": "What is the primary neurological mechanism that allows the brain to synchronize its internal rhythms with external auditory stimuli during sonic induction?",
            "options": [
                "The Frequency Following Response (FFR)",
                "The Myotatic Reflex",

                "The Doppler Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Frequency Following Response (FFR) is the brain's tendency to naturally align its dominant EEG frequency with the rhythmic pulse or frequency of an external sound source."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of induction, which brainwave range is the primary target for moving a client out of 'Active Beta' and into a state of relaxed awareness?",
            "options": [
                "Gamma (30-100 Hz)",
                "Alpha (8-12 Hz)",
                "High Beta (20-30 Hz)",
                "Delta (0.5-4 Hz)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) represent the 'bridge' between the external world and internal relaxation, serving as the first major milestone in the induction process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Instruments with soft attacks (slow rise time) and low-frequency fundamentals, such as large frosted crystal bowls or deep gongs played softly, are less likely to trigger the sympathetic nervous system."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'The Psychology of Tempo' (L4), what is the recommended 'target tempo' for heart rate entrainment to induce a parasympathetic state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A tempo of 50-60 BPM mimics a resting heart rate, encouraging the client's cardiovascular system to slow down through rhythmic entrainment."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Vocal priming, specifically the 'Voo' breath or low-frequency humming, is used in induction primarily to:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency vocalizations create internal vibrations that stimulate the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, signaling the body to enter a 'rest and digest' state."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pratyahara is the practice of sensory withdrawal, which in a sound bath is supported by dim lighting, eye masks, and a quiet environment to facilitate inward focus."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Involuntary sighs or hypnagogic jerks are classic indicators of the nervous system shifting from sympathetic dominance to the parasympathetic 'Threshold' state."

            "options": [
                "Immediately stop all sound to create silence",
                "Play much faster to distract them",
                "Start at a slightly higher tempo that matches their current state and gradually decelerate",
                "Tell the client to 'stop moving' via the microphone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective entrainment often requires 'meeting the client where they are' (matching their current high-beta tempo) and then gradually slowing down the rhythm to lead them into relaxation."
