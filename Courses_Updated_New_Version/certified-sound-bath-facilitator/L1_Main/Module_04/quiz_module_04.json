            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "question": "When identifying 'energetic stagnation' (L2), which physical sensation is a client most likely to report in an area where energy is 'stuck'?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stagnation is often described as 'cold,' 'dense,' or 'heavy,' representing a lack of movement or 'chi' in a specific area of the body."

            "question": "What is the primary technical difference between weighted and unweighted tuning forks in precision oscillation (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "Weighted forks are used for hearing, while unweighted are for the body",
                "Weighted forks have 'weights' at the ends of the tines to send vibration into the stem for bone conduction",
                "Unweighted forks vibrate longer than weighted forks",
                "Weighted forks produce higher-pitched overtones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weighted tuning forks (like Otto tuners) concentrate the vibration in the stem, making them ideal for placement directly on bones or trigger points."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In Gong Dynamics (L5), what is the 'Sonic Wash' intended to achieve during a session?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Sonic Wash' uses a build-up of harmonics to bypass the analytical mind (transient hypofrontality), allowing for deep emotional and physical release."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "According to Interval Theory (L6), which musical interval is known as the 'Diabolus in Musica' and is used to create the maximum tension required for 'breaking' stagnation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Tritone is highly dissonant and creates a 'restless' energy that is effective for breaking up stagnant patterns before resolving into a consonant interval."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "When modulating a singing bowl (L7), how does the facilitator create the 'wah-wah' or pulsing effect?",
            "options": [
                "By hitting the bowl with a metal hammer",
                "By moving the mallet in a circular motion while varying pressure or 'fanning' the bowl",
                "By filling the bowl with exactly 2 liters of water",
                "By singing into the bowl while playing it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pulsing or modulation is achieved through varying the speed, pressure, or angle of the mallet, or by moving the bowl in the air to create a Doppler-like effect."

            "id": "q4_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vibroacoustic studies have shown that low-frequency oscillations (like those from a 128 Hz fork or large gong) can stimulate osteoblast activity and provide significant pain relief for fibromyalgia."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In the 'Integration' phase (L8), why is it critical to follow a period of intense oscillation with 'Consonant Resolution'?",
            "options": [
                "To make the session last longer",
                "To ensure the client's nervous system returns to a state of safety and equilibrium",
                "Because dissonance is bad for the ears",
                "To prevent the instruments from breaking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oscillation and dissonance create 'work' for the nervous system; resolution into harmony allows the body to integrate the changes and enter a state of deep rest (parasympathetic dominance)."
