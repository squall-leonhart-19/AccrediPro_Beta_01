            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the nervous system is a facilitator primarily aiming to activate during a Neural Reset to promote social engagement and restoration?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the subconscious process by which the nervous system scans the environment for cues of safety or danger, independent of conscious thought."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Vibroacoustic therapy has been shown to stimulate the release of Nitric Oxide (NO) in the tissues. What is the primary benefit of this biochemical response?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By explaining the sounds and environment, the facilitator reduces the 'startle response' and hypervigilance, signaling to the client's neuroception that the space is safe."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Deep-toned gongs produce low-frequency vibrations and complex overtones that more effectively mask external noise and encourage the brain to down-shift from Beta to Alpha/Theta states."
