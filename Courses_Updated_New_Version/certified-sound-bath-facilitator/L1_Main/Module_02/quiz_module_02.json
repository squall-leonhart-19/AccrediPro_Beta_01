            "question": "According to the Neuro-Energetic Foundation of Intention, which brain structure acts as a 'gatekeeper' by filtering sensory data to prioritize information that aligns with the client's established intent?",
            "options": [
                "The Reticular Activating System (RAS)",

            "explanation": "The RAS is a bundle of nerves in the brainstem that filters out unnecessary information and highlights what is relevant to our goals and intentions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gains are the 'benefits' a client receives from a symptom (like attention or avoidance of responsibility), which can subconsciously block the manifestation of their intent."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intention sets the direction, but surrender allows the parasympathetic nervous system to take over. High effort creates 'performance anxiety' or stress, which prevents the deep relaxation needed for healing."
