            "question": "A client approaches an AccrediPro Certified Adaptogen Specialist™ seeking a diagnosis for their chronic fatigue syndrome and a prescription for adaptogens to cure it. According to the <span class=\"highlight\">scope of practice</span> (Lesson L1), what is the most appropriate ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a preliminary diagnosis and recommend a specific adaptogen for their condition.",
                "Explain that diagnosing conditions and prescribing treatments are outside the adaptogen specialist's scope of practice, and refer them to a qualified medical professional.",
                "Suggest a general adaptogen blend for energy support while avoiding any diagnostic language.",
                "Decline to work with the client as their request falls outside the service offering."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An adaptogen specialist's scope of practice focuses on education, lifestyle support, and non-prescriptive recommendations. Diagnosing medical conditions and prescribing treatments are roles reserved for licensed medical professionals. The ethical response is to clearly state the boundaries of practice and facilitate a referral."

            "question": "Before initiating any adaptogen protocol, a specialist must obtain <span class=\"highlight\">informed consent</span> (Lesson L2). Which of the following is NOT a fundamental component required for valid informed consent?",
            "options": [
                "A comprehensive discussion of potential benefits and known risks associated with the adaptogen protocol.",

                "Assurance that participation is voluntary and the client can withdraw at any time without penalty."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires full disclosure of relevant information, including benefits, risks, and alternatives, along with voluntary participation. Ethically, a specialist cannot guarantee specific outcomes or cures, as adaptogen efficacy can vary greatly between individuals and is influenced by numerous factors."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "An adaptogen specialist uses a cloud-based platform to store client notes and personal health information. To comply with <span class=\"highlight\">confidentiality and data protection</span> standards (Lesson L3), what is the most critical measure to ensure data security?",
            "options": [
                "Relying solely on the platform's default security settings.",
                "Ensuring the platform is HIPAA/GDPR compliant, uses end-to-end encryption, and has robust access controls.",

                "Regularly backing up data to an external hard drive without encryption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical data protection mandates the use of secure, compliant platforms that employ strong encryption and access controls to protect sensitive client information. Simply relying on default settings or unencrypted backups is insufficient to meet privacy standards like HIPAA or GDPR."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "An adaptogen specialist is approached by a close personal friend who wishes to become a client. This scenario represents a <span class=\"highlight\">dual relationship</span> (Lesson L4). What is the most ethical course of action for the specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the friend as a client but offer a professional discount due to their relationship.",
                "Clearly establish professional boundaries and proceed with the adaptogen protocol, ensuring no personal details interfere.",
                "Refer the friend to another qualified adaptogen specialist to avoid potential conflicts of interest and maintain professional objectivity.",
                "Treat the friend as a regular client, assuming the friendship will not impact professional judgment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships, especially with close friends or family, can compromise professional objectivity, lead to exploitation, or blur boundaries. The most ethical approach is to refer the individual to another qualified professional to protect both the client's interests and the integrity of the specialist-client relationship."

            "options": [
                "Confirm the claim if it sounds plausible and aligns with anecdotal evidence.",
                "Dismiss the article outright without explanation, stating it's 'fake news'.",
                "Discuss the importance of critically evaluating sources, explain the limitations of blog posts versus peer-reviewed research, and review the current scientific consensus on adaptogens and autoimmune conditions.",
                "Recommend the client try the adaptogen based on the article's strong claims, but advise caution."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires specialists to rely on evidence-based information. It's crucial to educate clients on how to discern credible sources, differentiate between marketing claims and scientific evidence, and provide accurate information based on peer-reviewed research, rather than validating unsubstantiated claims."

            "options": [
                "The aesthetic appeal of the product packaging and branding.",

                "The number of positive customer reviews on e-commerce platforms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most crucial factor for product integrity is rigorous third-party testing. This ensures the product contains what it claims, is free from harmful contaminants, and delivers the promised potency, upholding ethical standards for consumer safety and efficacy."

                "'Discover how adaptogens may support your body's stress response and promote balance.'",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing prohibits making unsubstantiated claims or guaranteeing specific outcomes, especially those related to curing diseases or achieving dramatic results like weight loss. Responsible communication emphasizes transparency, scientific accuracy, and appropriate disclaimers."

            "question": "A client with a history of severe clinical depression, currently managed with prescription medication, expresses interest in using adaptogens to 'boost their mood' and potentially reduce their medication. According to guidelines for <span class=\"highlight\">navigating complex cases and vulnerable populations</span> (Lesson L8), what is the most ethical action for the adaptogen specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend specific adaptogens known for mood support, suggesting they monitor their medication dosage.",
                "Advise against adaptogen use entirely, as it could interfere with their medication.",
                "Emphasize that adaptogens are not a substitute for prescribed medication and require the client to obtain explicit clearance and ongoing supervision from their psychiatrist or treating physician before considering any adaptogen protocol.",
                "Offer to collaborate directly with the client's psychiatrist without the client's explicit consent."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients with serious mental health conditions or those on prescription medication are considered vulnerable. An adaptogen specialist's ethical duty is to prioritize client safety, avoid interfering with medical treatment, and ensure any adaptogen use is approved and monitored by their primary healthcare provider or specialist."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of 25 studies (n=4,500) on a particular adaptogen shows a statistically significant but small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.2) for improving sleep quality. When discussing this with a client, an adaptogen specialist should ethically communicate that:",
            "options": [
                "This adaptogen is a highly effective solution for severe insomnia.",
                "The adaptogen has no real effect on sleep quality despite the statistical significance.",
                "While statistically significant, the practical or clinical impact of this adaptogen on sleep quality is likely to be small.",
                "The large sample size guarantees a profound individual benefit for all users."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.2) indicates a weak practical effect, even if statistically significant. Ethically, specialists must accurately interpret research findings, distinguishing between statistical significance and clinical relevance, and manage client expectations realistically regarding potential benefits."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical and legal data protection requires client records to be retained for a specific period, typically mandated by law or professional body guidelines (often 7-10 years), to address potential legal or ethical inquiries. After this period, secure disposal is necessary to protect privacy."
