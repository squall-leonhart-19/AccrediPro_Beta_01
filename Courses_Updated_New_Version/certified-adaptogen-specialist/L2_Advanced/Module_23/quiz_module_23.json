            "question": "A practitioner initiates Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) at 300mg BID for a client experiencing chronic stress. After 4 weeks, salivary cortisol shows persistently elevated evening levels, and the client reports increased irritability. Based on principles of precision dosing and biomarker interpretation, what is the most appropriate next step?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the Ashwagandha dose to 600mg BID, assuming a higher dose is needed for effect.",
                "Discontinue Ashwagandha and switch to a different adaptogen immediately.",
                "Reduce the Ashwagandha dose or adjust timing, as elevated evening cortisol and irritability may indicate an over-stimulation or paradoxical response for this individual.",
                "Add a stimulant adaptogen like Rhodiola to counteract the irritability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated evening cortisol and irritability can be signs of an individual's unique or paradoxical response to an adaptogen, even one typically considered calming. Precision dosing requires reducing the dose or adjusting timing to find the optimal therapeutic window, rather than increasing the dose or adding more stimulants."
