                "Immediately discontinue the Rhodiola and switch to Ashwagandha.",
                "Advise the client to increase the dose to acclimate faster.",
                "Suggest reducing the current dose by 25-50% for 3-5 days, ensuring adequate hydration, and reassessing.",
                "Instruct the client that these are expected 'detox' symptoms and to push through."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'start low, go slow' principle emphasizes gradual introduction and minor dose adjustments in response to initial mild, transient effects to optimize individual tolerance and response, as discussed in Lesson 2."

            "question": "A client expresses frustration after 5 days, stating they 'don't feel anything' from their adaptogen protocol. What is the most important expectation to manage in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Adaptogens always produce immediate, noticeable stimulant-like effects.",
                "Adaptogenic effects are often subtle and cumulative, taking 2-4 weeks to become apparent for many individuals.",
                "The adaptogen is likely ineffective for them and should be changed immediately.",
                "Feeling nothing indicates a placebo effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Managing client expectations involves educating them that adaptogen effects are typically subtle, cumulative, and often require several weeks of consistent use to manifest significantly, a key point from Lesson 3."

                "Adding another adaptogen like Holy Basil.",
                "Focusing solely on increasing the Ashwagandha dose.",
                "Prioritizing sleep hygiene improvements and reducing caffeine intake, as these foundational elements synergize with adaptogen action.",

            "question": "After 3 weeks on an initial Eleuthero protocol, a client reports no discernible change in energy or focus, and no adverse effects. What is the most appropriate initial protocol adjustment principle to apply?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately switch to a completely different adaptogen.",
                "Increase the current Eleuthero dosage incrementally, monitoring for another 2-3 weeks before further changes.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Initial protocol adjustments typically involve increasing the dosage of the current adaptogen incrementally, adhering to the 'one variable at a time' principle, before considering a complete change, as taught in Lesson 6."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Troubleshooting non-compliance often involves practical strategies such as habit stacking or digital reminders to integrate the protocol seamlessly into the client's daily routine, as discussed in Lesson 7."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Progress & Personalize' phase involves evolving the protocol beyond initial stabilization, focusing on optimization, long-term sustainability, and potentially introducing new adaptogens or cycling, as outlined in Lesson 8."

            "question": "Sarah, 35, begins an Ashwagandha protocol for mild anxiety. Her practitioner advises starting with 300mg of a 5% withanolide extract, once daily. After two weeks, she reports a 15% reduction in anxiety symptoms but no significant change in sleep. What would be the most judicious next step?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the dose to 600mg, taken once daily in the morning.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This approach incrementally increases the dosage while also adjusting administration timing to target specific outcomes (sleep), adhering to the principles of initial protocol adjustment from Lesson 6 and optimal dosing from Lesson 2."

            "options": [
                "Conclude the adaptogen is ineffective due to David's subjective report.",
                "Emphasize the importance of objective feedback (like his partner's observations) and structured tracking, as adaptogen effects can be subtle and difficult for individuals to self-perceive initially.",
                "Double the dose immediately to force a noticeable effect.",
                "Recommend discontinuing the adaptogen and trying a stimulant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptogen effects can be subtle. It's crucial to validate subjective reports with objective observations and structured feedback tools to capture the full spectrum of benefits, a key aspect of managing expectations and monitoring progress from Lessons 3 and 5."
