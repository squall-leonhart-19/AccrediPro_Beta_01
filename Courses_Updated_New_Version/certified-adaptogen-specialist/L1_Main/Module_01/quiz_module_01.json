            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "When assessing a client, an Adaptogen Specialist identifies that their chronic stress is significantly impacting their sleep quality, which in turn exacerbates their digestive issues and energy levels. This interconnectedness highlights the importance of which aspect of the A.D.A.P.T. Framework (L1) and holistic assessment principles (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing solely on treating the most prominent symptom (e.g., digestive issues) in isolation.",
                "Prioritizing the use of pharmaceutical interventions for each separate symptom.",
                "Recognizing the systemic and interconnected nature of bodily systems, where imbalances in one area (stress) can cascade to others (sleep, digestion, energy).",
                "Dismissing symptoms that do not fit into a single, clearly defined organ system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A core tenet of the A.D.A.P.T. Framework and holistic assessment is understanding the interconnectedness of bodily systems. Stress, sleep, digestion, and energy are deeply linked, and addressing root causes rather than isolated symptoms is key to effective adaptogen therapy, as taught in L1 and L6."
