            "question": "A client's comprehensive assessment reveals a flattened diurnal cortisol curve with elevated evening cortisol and low morning cortisol, alongside persistent fatigue and difficulty sleeping. This pattern most strongly indicates:",
            "options": ["Acute stress response.", "Adrenal insufficiency.", "Chronic HPA axis dysregulation.", "Hypothyroidism."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flattened diurnal cortisol curve, especially with elevated evening cortisol and low morning cortisol, is a classic sign of chronic HPA axis dysregulation, where the body struggles to maintain a healthy circadian rhythm of cortisol production. Adrenal insufficiency would typically show globally low cortisol."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old professional reports increased anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and frequent colds over the past six months, coinciding with a demanding project at work. Which primary physiological system is the most immediate target for adaptogen intervention?",
            "options": ["Cardiovascular system.", "Gastrointestinal integrity.", "Neuroendocrine-immune axis.", "Musculoskeletal system."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anxiety and difficulty concentrating point to neuroendocrine (HPA axis) involvement, while frequent colds indicate impaired immune function. These symptoms are hallmarks of chronic stress impacting the interconnected neuroendocrine-immune axis, a primary target for adaptogens."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When selecting an adaptogen supplement, a Certified Adaptogen Specialist™ prioritizes products with third-party testing for purity and potency. Why is this considered a critical quality standard?",
            "options": ["It guarantees the lowest price point for the consumer.", "It ensures the product is organic and sustainably sourced.", "It verifies the active compound concentration and absence of contaminants.", "It indicates the product has been approved by the FDA for therapeutic use."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Third-party testing is crucial for verifying that an adaptogen supplement contains the stated active compounds at the advertised potency and is free from harmful contaminants like heavy metals, pesticides, and microbial agents. This ensures both efficacy and safety, which are paramount in adaptogen selection."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A client is starting a new adaptogen protocol for chronic stress management. What is the most appropriate initial dosing strategy according to best practices?",
            "options": ["Start with the maximum recommended dose to achieve rapid results.", "Begin with a low dose and gradually titrate upwards based on individual response.", "Take a high dose for the first week, then reduce to a maintenance dose.", "Administer all adaptogens in a single, large dose at bedtime."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'start low and go slow' principle is fundamental in adaptogen therapy. Beginning with a low dose allows the practitioner to assess individual sensitivity and response, minimizing potential side effects and optimizing the therapeutic window as the dose is gradually increased."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which lifestyle strategy demonstrates the strongest synergistic potential with adaptogen use for enhancing overall stress resilience and HPA axis function?",
            "options": ["Consuming a high-sugar, processed food diet.", "Engaging in inconsistent, high-intensity exercise sessions only.", "Prioritizing consistent, high-quality sleep (7-9 hours/night).", "Relying solely on adaptogens without any dietary changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistent, high-quality sleep is foundational for HPA axis regulation, neurotransmitter balance, and overall recovery from stress. Adaptogens can support sleep, but their efficacy is significantly amplified when combined with robust sleep hygiene, creating a powerful synergy for stress resilience."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client seeks to improve mental clarity, focus, and memory while also managing mild anxiety related to academic pressure. Which adaptogen combination would be most appropriately tailored to these specific goals?",
            "options": ["Ashwagandha (for anxiety) and Lion's Mane (for cognitive function).", "Rhodiola (for energy/focus) and Eleuthero (for physical stamina).", "Holy Basil (for mood) and Schisandra (for liver support).", "Cordyceps (for energy) and Reishi (for immune modulation)."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is well-regarded for its anxiolytic and stress-reducing properties, helping manage anxiety. Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus) is a functional mushroom known for its neurotrophic effects, supporting nerve growth factor (NGF) production and enhancing cognitive functions like clarity, focus, and memory. This combination directly addresses both the anxiety and cognitive enhancement goals."

            "question": "A client currently takes warfarin (an anticoagulant) for a cardiovascular condition. Which adaptogen should be used with extreme caution or avoided due to potential drug-herb interactions?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola rosea.", "Panax ginseng.", "Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha).", "Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi)."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Panax ginseng is known to possess antiplatelet and anticoagulant properties, which can significantly increase the risk of bleeding when combined with anticoagulant medications like warfarin. Close monitoring and medical consultation are essential, and often avoidance is recommended in such cases."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client with an autoimmune condition, specifically Hashimoto's thyroiditis, is considering adaptogen therapy. Which adaptogen, known for its significant immune-modulating properties, should be approached with caution due to the potential to stimulate immune activity?",
            "options": ["Cordyceps sinensis.", "Eleuthero senticosus.", "Astragalus membranaceus.", "Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha)."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Astragalus membranaceus is a potent immune stimulant, often used to enhance immune function. In autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's, stimulating the immune system could theoretically exacerbate the autoimmune response. While some adaptogens like Ashwagandha are considered immunomodulatory and may be beneficial, strong immune stimulants like Astragalus require significant caution and medical oversight."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "When educating a client about the expected timeline for adaptogen benefits, what is the most realistic and appropriate statement?",
            "options": ["\"You should feel a significant improvement within 24-48 hours of starting the protocol.\"", "\"Adaptogens work instantaneously, similar to pharmaceutical medications, so effects are immediate.\"", "\"Benefits are typically gradual and cumulative, often becoming noticeable over several weeks to a few months.\"", "\"The effects of adaptogens are often imperceptible and may never be noticed.\""],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adaptogens work by helping the body adapt and rebalance physiological systems over time, rather than providing immediate, acute effects. Clients should be educated that consistent use over several weeks to a few months is typically required to observe noticeable, cumulative benefits, emphasizing patience and adherence."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client reports chronic stress, occasional insomnia, and a desire to improve overall resilience. Initial assessment shows elevated evening cortisol and mild HPA axis dysregulation. Based on this, which adaptogen would be a primary consideration for promoting relaxation and supporting a healthier sleep cycle, while also addressing stress resilience?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola rosea.", "Panax ginseng.", "Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha).", "Eleuthero senticosus."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is particularly well-suited for this client profile. It is renowned for its anxiolytic properties, ability to reduce elevated evening cortisol, and support restful sleep, making it an excellent choice for chronic stress, insomnia, and overall HPA axis regulation and resilience."
