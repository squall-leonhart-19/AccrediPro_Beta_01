            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a defining characteristic of an adaptogen according to the foundational principles discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Non-toxic at therapeutic doses.",
                "Normalizing effect on physiological function.",
                "Specific action on a single organ system.",
                "Increases the body's non-specific resistance to stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adaptogens are characterized by their non-specific action, meaning they help the body adapt to various stressors rather than targeting a single organ or system. Options A, B, and D are all core characteristics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 stresses the 'start low, go slow' principle. This personalized approach allows the practitioner to assess individual tolerance and response, gradually increasing the dose to find the optimal therapeutic window, thereby enhancing safety and efficacy."
