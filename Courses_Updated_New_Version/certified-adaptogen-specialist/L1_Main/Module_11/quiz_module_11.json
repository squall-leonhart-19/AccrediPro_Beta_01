            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "According to I.I. Brekhman's foundational criteria for adaptogens, which of the following is a core characteristic?",
            "options": [
                "Must directly stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies.",
                "Must exert a normalizing influence on physiological function, regardless of the direction of deviation.",
                "Must be a potent antimicrobial agent with broad-spectrum activity.",
                "Must provide immediate, acute energy boosts similar to stimulants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brekhman's criteria emphasize that adaptogens must be non-toxic, produce a non-specific increase in resistance to stress, and have a normalizing influence on physiological function, helping to restore homeostasis regardless of the initial imbalance."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Adaptogens primarily modulate the stress response by influencing the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. Which component of the HPA axis is directly stimulated by the hypothalamus in response to stress, initiating the cascade?",
            "options": [
                "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)",
                "Cortisol",
                "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH)",
                "Adrenal Medulla"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In response to perceived stress, the hypothalamus releases Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH), which then signals the pituitary gland to release ACTH, initiating the HPA axis cascade."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A common mechanism by which many adaptogens confer protection against various stressors is by upregulating the expression of <span class=\"highlight\">Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)</span>. What is the primary role of HSPs in cellular stress response?",
            "options": [
                "To directly neutralize free radicals and oxidative damage.",
                "To facilitate the proper folding and repair of damaged proteins, maintaining cellular integrity.",
                "To inhibit neurotransmitter synthesis, reducing neural excitability.",
                "To increase blood glucose levels, providing immediate energy reserves."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) act as molecular chaperones, helping to refold misfolded or damaged proteins, thereby protecting cellular integrity and function under various stress conditions, including heat, oxidative stress, and inflammation."

            "question": "A client seeking adaptogenic support for long-term cognitive endurance and immune modulation without significant overstimulation might be better suited for which ginseng variety, and why?",
            "options": [
                "Panax Ginseng (*Panax ginseng*), due to its higher Rg1 content promoting stimulating effects.",
                "American Ginseng (*Panax quinquefolius*), due to its higher Rb1 content promoting more calming and restorative effects.",
                "Panax Ginseng, as it is traditionally known for its cooling properties in Traditional Chinese Medicine.",
                "American Ginseng, because it contains unique ginsenosides not found in Panax Ginseng."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "American Ginseng (*Panax quinquefolius*) is generally considered more calming or 'cooling' than Panax Ginseng, with a higher proportion of ginsenosides like Rb1, making it suitable for those who might be sensitive to the more stimulating effects of Panax Ginseng while still offering cognitive and immune benefits."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Withanolides are the primary active compounds in Ashwagandha (*Withania somnifera*) responsible for its adaptogenic, anxiolytic, and stress-reducing effects, often influencing GABAergic pathways and modulating the HPA axis."

            "question": "A 45-year-old female client with a history of hypertension and currently on anticoagulant medication (e.g., warfarin) expresses interest in adaptogens for stress management. Which adaptogen would require particular caution or be contraindicated due to potential interactions, and why?",
            "options": [
                "Ashwagandha (*Withania somnifera*), due to its potential to lower blood pressure, which could exacerbate hypotension.",
                "Rhodiola (*Rhodiola rosea*), due to its mild stimulatory effects which might interfere with sleep.",
                "Panax Ginseng (*Panax ginseng*), due to its known antiplatelet effects and potential to significantly interact with anticoagulant medications.",
                "Schisandra (*Schisandra chinensis*), due to its hepatoprotective actions potentially altering the metabolism of various drugs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Panax Ginseng is known to have antiplatelet effects and can increase the risk of bleeding when combined with anticoagulant medications (e.g., warfarin). This makes it a significant contraindication for clients on such drugs, necessitating careful screening and alternative adaptogen selection."
