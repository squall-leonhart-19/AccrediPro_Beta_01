            "question": "An adaptogen specialist is approached by a client with severe anxiety and depression, currently on prescription medication. What is the MOST ethical and legally sound initial action for the specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend specific adaptogens and dosage, advising the client to gradually reduce their medication.",
                "Advise the client to stop their medication immediately and try a high dose of adaptogens for quick relief.",
                "Educate the client on how adaptogens support the body's stress response, emphasize they are not a substitute for medical treatment, and recommend consulting their prescribing physician before incorporating any new supplements.",
                "Refer them directly to a psychiatrist without discussing adaptogens, as this falls outside the specialist's scope of practice entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most ethical and legally sound action is to operate within one's scope of practice.
