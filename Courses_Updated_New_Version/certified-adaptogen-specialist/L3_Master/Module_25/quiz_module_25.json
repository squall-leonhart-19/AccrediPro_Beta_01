            "options": [
                "Supervision focuses on ensuring competency, client safety, and adherence to professional standards, while mentoring emphasizes the mentee's broader professional growth, skill development, and career advancement.",
                "Supervision is always a formal, paid arrangement, whereas mentoring is exclusively informal and pro bono.",
                "Mentoring involves direct instruction on specific adaptogen protocols, while supervision is solely about administrative oversight.",
                "Supervisors are always required to have more clinical experience than mentors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Supervision is often structured and mandated for competency and ethical practice, focusing on specific case review and client outcomes.
