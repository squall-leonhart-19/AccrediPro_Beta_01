            "id": "q22_1",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Power Dynamic' (L1), why is it ethically imperative for a reader to establish clear professional boundaries from the outset?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the reader can charge higher premium rates for their time",
                "To mitigate the inherent 'asymmetry of power' where the client may view the reader as an infallible authority",
                "To prevent the client from asking questions about the reader's personal life",
                "To speed up the reading process and handle more clients per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'asymmetry of power' is a psychological reality in spiritual consulting; practitioners must actively manage this to prevent client disempowerment and ensure the client remains the primary agent in their own life."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "A client asks: 'Does this spread indicate that I will win my upcoming medical malpractice lawsuit?' According to the 'Big Three' (L2) ethics, what is the most professional response?",
            "options": [
                "Interpret the cards specifically to predict the legal outcome of the case",
                "Tell the client that the cards are never wrong in legal matters",
                "State that you do not provide legal or medical advice and suggest they consult their attorney for case outcomes",
                "Charge a higher fee because legal questions require more archetypal energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Legal, medical, and financial advice are 'The Big Three' protected fields. Readers must provide a clear disclaimer and refer clients to qualified professionals to avoid practicing without a license and causing harm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of 'Informed Consent' in a Tarot practice as discussed in L3?",
            "options": [
                "To get the client to sign a waiver so they cannot leave a bad review",
                "To ensure the client understands the reader's methodology, the limitations of the reading, and their right to terminate the session",
                "To collect the client's data for future marketing purposes",
                "To confirm the client believes in the supernatural power of the cards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent ensures the client enters the session with realistic expectations, understands the 'Orientation' of the reader (e.g., secular vs. spiritual), and knows their autonomy is respected."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "L4 discusses 'Spiritual Bypassing.' Which of the following is an example of a reader facilitating this ethically problematic behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging a client to seek professional therapy for their grief",
                "Suggesting that a client's experience of clinical depression is simply a 'low vibration' that can be fixed by thinking more positively",
                "Using the cards to help a client find practical solutions to a workplace conflict",
                "Explaining that the cards reflect psychological archetypes rather than literal spirits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual bypassing involves using spiritual concepts to avoid or dismiss psychological wounds or real-world problems. Suggesting 'high vibrations' can cure clinical issues is a classic example."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "According to L5 on Cultural Competence, how should a reader handle archetypes that may have different meanings across various cultures?",
            "options": [
                "Always use the traditional 1910 Rider-Waite-Smith definitions regardless of the client",
                "Avoid using any cards that might be controversial",
                "Practice 'Archetypal Sensitivity' by acknowledging the client's cultural context and how it might influence their interpretation of the symbol",
                "Tell the client their cultural view is incorrect based on occult history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural competence requires the reader to be aware of their own biases and to respect the client's cultural lens, ensuring the archetypal language used is relevant and respectful to the individual."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "A client requests a reading to find out if their ex-partner is seeing someone new. Based on the 'Ethics of Third-Party Readings' (L6), why is this generally discouraged?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is technically difficult to read for someone who isn't present",
                "Because it violates the privacy and energetic autonomy of the third party who has not given consent",
                "Because the cards are only accurate for the person paying for the reading",
                "Because it takes too much time to focus on someone else's energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practitioners prioritize 'privacy and consent.' Reading for a third party without their permission is considered an invasion of privacy and often fuels the client's obsession rather than their growth."

        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "In 'Ethical Delivery' (L7), what is the main difference between 'Fatalistic' and 'Empowerment-Based' reading styles?",
            "options": [
                "Fatalistic readings are more accurate, while empowerment readings are just for fun",
                "Fatalistic readings tell the client what *will* happen (removing agency), while empowerment readings focus on how the client can *respond* (restoring agency)",
                "Empowerment readings are always positive, while fatalistic readings are always negative",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same thing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowerment-based reading shifts the focus from an unchangeable future to the client's current power of choice, which is the cornerstone of ethical, professional practice."

        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "L8 emphasizes 'Practitioner Integrity.' What is a recommended strategy to prevent 'Compassion Fatigue' or burnout in a high-volume Tarot practice?",

                "Reading for more clients to get used to the energy",
                "Ignoring personal emotions and remaining 'robotic' during sessions",
                "Engaging in regular 'Supervision' or peer review to process the emotional weight of client sessions",
                "Only reading for clients who have positive problems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional supervision (borrowed from the counseling world) allows readers to discuss difficult cases, manage countertransference, and maintain their own mental health to provide better service."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "If a client shows signs of 'Client Dependency' (L4), such as asking the same question daily, what is the practitioner's ethical duty?",
            "options": [
                "Continue to take their money as long as they want to pay",
                "Tell them the cards are 'broken' for them",
                "Gently set a boundary, explain the 'Law of Diminishing Returns' in readings, and suggest a waiting period before the next session",
                "Block the client immediately without explanation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical readers discourage dependency. Explaining that frequent readings on the same topic lead to confusion (diminishing returns) helps the client return to their own decision-making process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Gold Standard' for a legal disclaimer in a professional Tarot practice according to the module?",
            "options": [
                "A verbal statement made only if the client asks",
                "A written disclaimer visible on the website and booking confirmation stating that readings are for 'entertainment/self-development' and not a substitute for professional advice",
                "A small note hidden in the footer of the website",
                "There is no need for a disclaimer if you are a certified reader"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A clear, written disclaimer provided *before* the transaction is the gold standard for legal and ethical protection, ensuring the client acknowledges the nature of the service."
