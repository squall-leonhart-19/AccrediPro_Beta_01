            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "According to the Somatic Marker Hypothesis discussed in Lesson 1, which area of the brain integrates emotional signals from the body to create 'gut feelings' during a reading?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Primary Motor Cortex",
                "The Medulla Oblongata"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The vmPFC acts as a 'summing station' for somatic markers—physical sensations that the brain uses to guide decision-making and intuitive leaps before the conscious mind catches up."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In Jungian Psychology (Lesson 2), what is the primary difference between the 'Personal Unconscious' and the 'Collective Unconscious'?",
            "options": [
                "The Personal Unconscious contains only repressed memories, while the Collective contains future predictions.",
                "The Collective Unconscious consists of universal archetypes shared by all humans, whereas the Personal contains individual life experiences.",
                "The Personal Unconscious is accessible via Tarot, but the Collective is not.",
                "There is no difference; Jung used the terms interchangeably."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Jung posited that the Collective Unconscious is a reservoir of the experiences of our species, manifesting as universal symbols (archetypes) found in Tarot imagery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "The Pauli-Jung collaboration defined 'Synchronicity' as an 'acausal connecting principle.' What does 'acausal' imply in the context of a Tarot reading?",
            "options": [
                "The cards caused the event to happen in the future.",
                "The reader's energy physically moved the cards into a specific order.",
                "The event and the card share a meaningful connection without one causing the other.",
                "The reading was inaccurate because no cause was identified."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acausality means that two events (drawing a card and a life event) are linked by meaning rather than a direct cause-and-effect physical relationship."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Historical scholarship (Lesson 4) debunked the myth that Tarot originated in Ancient Egypt. Where does current evidence place the origin of the 78-card deck?",
            "options": [
                "18th-century France",
                "15th-century Northern Italy",

                "19th-century England"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Historical records and surviving decks like the Visconti-Sforza confirm Tarot originated as a parlor game called 'tarocchini' in 15th-century Northern Italy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "The 'Projective Hypothesis' in Tarot (Lesson 5) suggests that the cards function similarly to which clinical psychological tool?",
            "options": [
                "The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)",
                "The Beck Depression Inventory",
                "The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)",
                "The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Like the TAT, Tarot cards provide ambiguous stimuli that allow clients to project their internal narratives, conflicts, and desires onto the imagery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "When using the 'Hit Journal' methodology from Lesson 6, what is the 'Probability Baseline' used to determine if intuitive hits are statistically significant?",
            "options": [
                "The ratio of correct guesses to the total number of cards in the deck (1/78).",
                "The reader's subjective feeling of accuracy.",
                "Whether the client paid for the session or not.",
                "The number of Major Arcana drawn vs. Minor Arcana."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "To track intuition quantitatively, one must compare the frequency of 'hits' against the mathematical probability of drawing a specific card by random chance."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Research on the 'Therapeutic Alliance' (Lesson 7) indicates that the quality of the bond between practitioner and client accounts for what percentage of the variance in successful outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "15%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple meta-analyses in psychotherapy and coaching show that approximately 30% of successful outcomes are attributed to the relationship/alliance, regardless of the specific modality used."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "In the O.R.A.C.L.E. Framework™ (Lesson 8), the 'R' stands for 'Reflection.' What does this step specifically require the reader to do?",
            "options": [
                "Read the definition of the card from a book.",
                "Reflect the client's own words back to them to ensure alignment.",
                "Wait for the client to tell them what the card means.",
                "Ignore the imagery and focus only on psychic 'downloads'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflection involves active listening and mirroring the client's language to validate their experience and deepen the therapeutic alliance."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A 2019 study on 'Apophenia' mentioned in Lesson 1 found that the brain releases which neurotransmitter when it identifies a pattern in random data?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Dopamine",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The brain's reward system releases dopamine when it 'solves' a puzzle or finds a pattern, which explains the 'Aha!' moment often experienced during a reading."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Quantum Entanglement' as a metaphor for Tarot. What is the key characteristic of entangled particles that parallels intuitive 'knowing'?",
            "options": [
                "They only interact when they are in the same room.",
                "They change color based on the observer's mood.",
                "They remain connected such that the state of one instantaneously influences the other, regardless of distance.",
                "They eventually disappear if not observed regularly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-locality in quantum mechanics suggests that distance does not prevent particles from being linked, providing a theoretical (though metaphorical) framework for remote viewing and distance readings."
