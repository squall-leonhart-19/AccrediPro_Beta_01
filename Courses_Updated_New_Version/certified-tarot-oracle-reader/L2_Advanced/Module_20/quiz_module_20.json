            "question": "When performing 'Field Scanning' during a 10-card spread, a practitioner identifies a 'Hollow Resonance' in the future positions. What does this typically signify?",
            "options": [
                "A definitive negative outcome is inevitable.",
                "The client has already achieved the goal in their mind.",

                "The client is actively blocking the manifestation through fear."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hollow Resonance in field scanning indicates a lack of 'charge' or 'weight,' suggesting the potential future is still fluid or the client has not yet committed energy toward that specific outcome."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low Agency Score (under 4) indicates the client feels powerless. The practitioner should avoid 'big' advice and instead focus on micro-actions that help the client regain a sense of control."

                "Thoth decks are more positive and encouraging.",
                "Thoth decks emphasize objective systems and energetic structures rather than narrative/scenic storytelling.",
                "RWS decks are considered 'amateur' in professional assessment.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thoth-style decks are preferred for complex, systemic inquiries (like corporate career paths) because they focus on the underlying 'architecture' of a situation rather than just the narrative 'story.'"

                "The client is being lied to by someone in their inner circle.",
                "The blockage stems from self-betrayal or a 'lone wolf' mentality that prevents collaboration.",
                "The client needs to be more strategic and secretive about their plans.",
                "The blockage is purely financial and relates to theft."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a diagnostic context, the Seven of Swords as a 'Root Cause' usually points to internal patterns of avoidance, self-deception, or an inability to trust others (lone wolf syndrome)."
