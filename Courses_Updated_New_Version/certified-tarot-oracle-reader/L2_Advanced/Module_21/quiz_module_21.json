            "question": "In the ORACLE framework of metaphysical treatment planning, what is the primary objective of the 'Orientation' (O) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a predictive timeline for the client's future events",
                "To establish the client's energetic baseline and current state of psychic regulation",
                "To choose the specific tarot deck that best matches the client's aesthetic",
                "To finalize the strategic roadmap and action items"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orientation is the foundational step where the practitioner assesses the client's 'Energetic Baseline'—their current emotional, mental, and spiritual state—to ensure the session is calibrated correctly."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When identifying 'Resonance' (R), a practitioner notices a client has a visceral, negative physical reaction to 'The Tower.' According to professional standards, how should this be handled?",
            "options": [
                "Remove the card from the reading to avoid further client distress",
                "Explain that the card is just a symbol and has no real-world power",
                "Utilize the reaction as a 'Somatic Gateway' to identify deep-seated emotional alignments or fears",
                "Immediately switch to an Oracle deck with more positive imagery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonance is about identifying symbolic and emotional alignments; a strong visceral reaction indicates a high-charge area that provides a gateway into the client's subconscious narrative."

            "options": [
                "It focuses on the 'Soul’s Narrative' and long-term evolutionary themes rather than situational outcomes",
                "It requires the use of at least three different archetypal dictionaries during the session",
                "It is only used when the client asks specifically about their past lives",
                "It focuses exclusively on the Major Arcana and ignores the Minor Arcana"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Archetypal Analysis decodes the soul's narrative, looking at the deeper patterns of the Self's evolution rather than just the immediate 'Persona' or situational challenges."

                "General advice that could apply to anyone in the client's situation",
                "Synthesized insights that can be converted into specific, measurable behavioral or energetic shifts",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clarity is the process of synthesizing metaphysical insights into 'Actionable Intelligence'—concrete steps that the client can actually implement to change their reality."

            "options": [
                "To convince the client that their beliefs are factually incorrect",
                "To facilitate the energetic and cognitive 'unhooking' from old narratives to allow for a breakthrough",
                "To perform a ritual that removes the belief without the client's conscious participation",
                "To ignore the beliefs and focus only on the positive cards in the spread"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liberation is about facilitating breakthroughs where the client is freed (unhooked) from the energetic and cognitive constraints of their previous narrative."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client has a dysregulated baseline (static), the practitioner must first stabilize that baseline through grounding or regulation techniques before proceeding with the reading."

                "The session will end too quickly",
                "The insights may be 'intellectually correct' but fail to land emotionally, leading to low client compliance",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without Resonance, the client lacks the emotional 'buy-in' or alignment with the symbols. Insights may be understood logically but won't have the emotional weight necessary to drive real change."
