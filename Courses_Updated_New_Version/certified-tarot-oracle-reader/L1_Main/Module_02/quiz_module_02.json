            "question": "In the O.R.A.C.L.E. framework, how is 'Intuitive Resonance' specifically defined?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to memorize all 78 card meanings and recite them accurately.",
                "The vibrational alignment between the reader, the symbolic tool, and the querent’s energetic field.",
                "The physical act of shuffling the cards until they feel warm to the touch.",
                "The statistical probability that a specific card will appear in a spread."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resonance is the second stage of the O.R.A.C.L.E. workflow, focusing on the energetic 'click' or alignment between the reader, the cards, and the querent."

            "question": "A reader experiences a sudden 'tightness in the chest' while looking at the Three of Swords. Which 'Clair' is primarily being activated?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clairsentience involves receiving intuitive information through physical sensations or emotional 'gut feelings' in the body."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "What is the primary function of a 'Visual Anchor' during a Tarot reading?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the querent while the reader looks up meanings in a book.",
                "To serve as a focal point that triggers a deeper intuitive 'ping' or realization beyond the standard definition.",
                "To ensure the reader maintains eye contact with the querent at all times.",
                "To provide a physical weight that keeps the cards from moving on the table."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visual anchors are specific details in the card's art that 'catch the eye' and act as a springboard for intuitive resonance and specific messages."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to Elemental Harmonics, which two elements are traditionally considered 'Inimical' or naturally dissonant?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fire and Water are opposites; Fire evaporates Water, and Water extinguishes Fire, creating a 'dissonant' resonance that often indicates conflict or internal tension in a reading."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Third Space' is described as the foundation of the Reader-Querent Bridge. What does this space represent?",
            "options": [

                "The shared energetic field where the reader's intuition and the querent's reality meet.",
                "The time gap between the shuffling of the cards and the layout.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Third Space is the co-created energetic environment where resonance occurs, allowing the reader to access information relevant to the querent."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When a reader experiences 'Shadow Resonance' or dissonance because a card triggers their own personal trauma, what is the recommended professional response?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the feeling and continue the reading using only memorized meanings.",
                "End the reading immediately and tell the querent they are 'unreadable.'",
                "Practice 'The Pause'—acknowledge the internal trigger, ground the energy, and refocus on the querent's context.",
                "Tell the querent about your personal trauma to build rapport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Navigating dissonance requires self-awareness. 'The Pause' allows the reader to separate their own 'shadow' from the querent's message."

                "Oracle decks require more memorization of history.",
                "Oracle decks rely almost entirely on thematic and artistic resonance rather than a fixed 78-card structure.",
                "Oracle decks cannot be used for resonance; they are only for 'yes/no' questions.",
                "Tarot decks are strictly logical, while Oracle decks are strictly emotional."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because Oracle decks lack the universal structure of the Tarot (Major/Minor Arcana), resonance is the primary tool for interpretation, guided by the deck's specific theme."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Numerical Harmonics suggest that a 'preponderance of Fives' in a reading generally indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Stability, material success, and foundations.",
                "New beginnings and raw potential.",
                "Instability, conflict, or a necessary 'break' in the structure of the Four.",
                "Finality, completion, and the end of a cycle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In numerology, Fives represent the disruption of the stable Four, signaling a period of change, challenge, or growth through friction."

            "question": "Which of the following is a symptom of 'Weak Resonance' during the O.R.A.C.L.E. workflow?",
            "options": [
                "The reader feels a 'flow state' and the cards seem to tell a story effortlessly.",
                "The reader feels 'mechanical,' relying solely on keywords without any intuitive 'pings' or connection to the querent.",
                "The querent begins to cry because the message is so accurate.",
                "The reader experiences a clear 'Claircognizant' download."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weak resonance feels mechanical and 'dry.' It happens when the reader is stuck in 'Observation' (Step 1) and fails to move into 'Resonance' (Step 2)."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah' from Lesson 5, how did the reader re-establish resonance when the querent was skeptical and 'closed off'?",
            "options": [
                "By demanding the querent believe in the cards.",
                "By using a 'Resonance Reset'—taking a collective breath and asking an open-ended question to invite the querent into the 'Third Space.'",
                "By stopping the reading and charging a higher fee.",
                "By switching to a different deck without explanation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Resonance Reset' uses breath and inquiry to lower the querent's defenses and synchronize the energetic field between reader and querent."
