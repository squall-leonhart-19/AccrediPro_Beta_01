            "question": "In the Philosophy of Agency (L1), how is 'Empowerment' fundamentally distinguished from 'Fatalism' in a Tarot context?",
            "options": [
                "Fatalism views the cards as suggestions, while Empowerment views them as absolute commands.",
                "Fatalism assumes the future is fixed; Empowerment assumes the client is the primary architect of their future through choice.",
                "Fatalism focuses on the Major Arcana, while Empowerment focuses only on the Minor Arcana.",
                "There is no functional difference; both rely on the reader's intuition to dictate the client's path."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowerment-based reading shifts the focus from 'what will happen' (fatalism) to 'what the client can do' (agency), recognizing the client as the active driver of their own life."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "When translating symbols into strategic action (L2), which 'Action Translation' for the Eight of Swords best represents the Empowerment methodology?",
            "options": [
                "Wait for someone else to come and untie the bandages.",
                "Accept that you are currently trapped and cannot move until the cycle ends.",
                "Identify one self-imposed limiting belief and list three pieces of evidence that disprove it.",
                "Ignore the card entirely as it is too negative for an empowered reading."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowered action translation turns passive symbols into active tasks. Identifying and challenging limiting beliefs moves the client from a state of 'trapped' to 'analytical agency.'"

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Co-Creative Pathfinding, what is the primary role of the reader during the goal-setting phase?",
            "options": [
                "To tell the client exactly which goal they should pursue based on the Ace of Pentacles.",
                "To act as a facilitator who helps the client refine their own goals using the 'SMART' framework.",
                "To discourage the client from setting goals that seem too difficult for their current spread.",
                "To set the goals for the client to ensure they are 'spiritually aligned' with the reader's vision."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The reader facilitates the process, ensuring goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART), but the goals must originate from the client."

            "id": "q6_4",

            "options": [
                "To satisfy the client's desire for mystical or occult practices.",
                "To ensure the client returns for a follow-up reading within 30 days.",
                "To bridge the gap between subconscious insight and conscious habit through neuroplasticity.",
                "To prove the reader has magical authority over the client's daily routine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rituals serve as somatic and psychological anchors that help translate the 'aha' moment of a reading into repetitive, neural-pathway-building actions."

                "'The Universe is going to grant you the success you've been waiting for.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowered language uses 'How' and 'You' to place the power back in the client's hands, rather than making them a passive recipient of external events."

                "It is a discount code given to the client for their next session.",
                "It is a summary of all the negative cards to ensure the client remains cautious."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Action Affirmation is a verbal commitment from the client, which significantly increases the psychological likelihood of follow-through."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional ethics dictate that empowerment does not include practicing medicine, law, or therapy without a license. Knowing when to refer out is a hallmark of a professional reader."

            "id": "q6_9",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This question focuses on immediate, actionable agency (boundary setting) and future-oriented planning (resume updating), rather than passive waiting."

                "The client becomes too successful and no longer needs the reader.",
                "The reader loses money because the session ends too quickly.",
                "The client may feel shamed or blamed for their circumstances if they cannot 'manifest' a change in a systemic issue.",
                "The cards will lose their spiritual charge if used for practical goal setting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical empowerment recognizes that while we have agency, we do not have total control over external systems. Toxic positivity can lead to 'spiritual bypassing' or victim-blaming."
