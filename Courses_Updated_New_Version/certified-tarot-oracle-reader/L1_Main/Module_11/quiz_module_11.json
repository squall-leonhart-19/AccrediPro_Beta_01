            "question": "In the O.R.A.C.L.E. Framework™, what is the primary distinction between 'Orientation (O)' and traditional question-asking?",
            "options": [
                "Orientation focuses solely on the client's astrological chart before the cards are drawn.",
                "Orientation is the process of uncovering the 'Root Inquiry' or the 'Question behind the Question' to ensure the session addresses the soul's need.",
                "Orientation is a 20-minute silent meditation performed by the reader alone.",
                "Orientation is the phase where the reader decides which deck to use based on the client's aura."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orientation (O) moves beyond surface-level queries (e.g., 'Will I get the job?') to find the Sacred Inquiry (e.g., 'What is blocking my professional alignment?'), ensuring the reading has depth and purpose."

            "options": [
                "The reader is experiencing a digestive issue unrelated to the reading.",
                "The reader is projecting their own fears onto the client's cards.",
                "The reader is using 'Somatic Attunement' to mirror the client's energetic or emotional state through interoceptive awareness.",
                "The 10 of Swords always indicates a physical injury to the midsection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonance involves using the reader's body as a finely tuned instrument (Interoceptive Awareness) to pick up on the client's unspoken energetic 'charge' or emotional blockages."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clarity is about synthesis. To avoid overwhelming the client, the reader must move from 'macro' archetypes to 'micro' actionable steps, focusing on a singular, cohesive message."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liberation focuses on identifying the 'Energetic Hook' or the psychological loop that keeps a client stuck. This is often revealed through the repetition of archetypal themes in different areas of their life."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the O.R.A.C.L.E. Framework™, Clarity must lead to action. For the 8 of Swords, this means moving from the feeling of being trapped (symbol) to a specific, manageable action (boundary)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A critical part of Resonance is discernment—ensuring the reader isn't projecting their own 'stuff' onto the client. This requires high levels of self-awareness and energetic hygiene."
