                "To memorize the specific historical dates of the deck's creation",
                "To establish a secure energetic container and clear intentions for the seeker",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Architecture of Orientation focuses on setting the 'container'—the energetic and psychological space that allows for deep, safe, and focused intuitive work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic Resonance treats the body as an instrument; interoceptive signals (gut feelings, heart rate changes) are viewed as valid data points in the intuitive process."
