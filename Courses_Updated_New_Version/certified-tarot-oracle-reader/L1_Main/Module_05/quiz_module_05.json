            "question": "In the Alchemy of Release (L1), how is the 'Liberation Phase' distinct from the 'Awareness Phase'?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses purely on intellectual understanding of the problem.",
                "It marks the transition from identifying a pattern to the active energetic severance of that pattern.",
                "It is the final stage where the client has already achieved all their goals.",
                "It involves adding more cards to the spread to gain more information."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liberation is the active phase of 'doing'—where the client moves beyond knowing why they are stuck to actually severing the energetic ties that bind them."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which card combination is most likely to indicate a 'Shadow Anchor' (L2) involving a refusal to let go of material security at the expense of soul growth?",

                "Four of Pentacles and The Devil",
                "Three of Cups and Six of Wands",
                "Ace of Swords and Page of Wands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Four of Pentacles represents hoarding/clinging, while The Devil indicates an unhealthy attachment or perceived lack of freedom, creating a powerful 'Shadow Anchor' in the material realm."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "When performing 'Archetypal Reframing' (L3) on the Ten of Swords, how should a reader describe the 'Liberation' aspect of this card?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign that more pain is coming and the client should prepare.",
                "As the absolute lowest point from which the only possible movement is upward.",
                "As a suggestion to ignore the pain and focus on the positive.",
                "As a literal warning of physical back injury."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing the Ten of Swords focuses on the 'finality' of the pain; it represents the end of a cycle where the old way of thinking has been completely exhausted, allowing for a fresh start."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "During Somatic Integration (L4), a client who successfully 'releases' the energy of the Nine of Swords is most likely to report which physical sensation?",
            "options": [
                "A tightening in the jaw and temples.",
                "A heavy sensation in the pit of the stomach.",
                "A sudden cooling or 'lightness' in the chest and forehead.",
                "Increased tension in the lower back and hamstrings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Nine of Swords is associated with mental anguish and anxiety; its somatic release typically involves the clearing of 'heat' or pressure from the head and chest areas."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In Lesson L5, which ritual element is specifically recommended when 'Ritualizing the Release' of an emotional attachment represented by the Three of Swords?",
            "options": [
                "A fire ritual to burn the card (metaphorically).",
                "A water-based ritual, such as a salt bath or 'washing away' ceremony.",
                "Burial of a physical object in the earth.",
                "A shouting ritual to release vocal tension."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because the Three of Swords deals with emotional heartache (Water element context), water-based rituals are most effective for 'washing away' the grief and purifying the emotional body."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Which card, when appearing reversed in an ancestral spread, often indicates a 'Karmic Loop' (L6) of scarcity passed down through the paternal line?",

                "The Empress Reversed",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The King of Pentacles Reversed often represents a corruption of provider energy or a legacy of financial instability and scarcity mindset inherited from paternal ancestors."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson L7, what is the 'Secondary Gain' a client might receive from staying in the energy of the Five of Cups?",
            "options": [
                "The excitement of new beginnings.",
                "The 'safety' of not having to risk failure by trying again.",
                "Increased social status and recognition.",
                "Financial compensation from others."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain is the 'hidden benefit' of staying stuck. In the Five of Cups, mourning the past provides a shield against the vulnerability required to move forward and risk failing again."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "When 'Integrating the Void' (L8), why is it critical for the reader to discourage the client from immediately starting a new project or relationship?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client doesn't have enough money yet.",
                "Because the 'Void' is a necessary period of neutral integration where the 'new self' is still forming.",
                "Because the reader needs to sell them more sessions first.",
                "Because the cards say it will definitely fail."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rushing to fill the void often results in recreating the old patterns. The liberation process requires a period of 'emptiness' to ensure the new growth is not just a reaction to the old."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A case study in Module 5 describes 'Client M' who felt 'guilty' after releasing a toxic family dynamic. This is an example of which concept?",

                "Karmic Retribution"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resistance to the Void often manifests as guilt or discomfort because the client is used to the 'noise' of the old conflict and interprets the new 'silence' as a mistake or a betrayal."

            "id": "q5_10",

            "options": [
                "Position 1 (The Heart of the Matter)",
                "Position 8 (External Environment)",
                "Position 4 (The Root/Subconscious)",
                "Position 10 (The Outcome)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shadow Anchors are almost always rooted in the subconscious (Position 4), as they represent the foundational beliefs that hold the rest of the structure in place."
