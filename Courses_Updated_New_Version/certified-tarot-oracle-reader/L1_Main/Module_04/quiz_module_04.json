            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative Fluidity is the ability to weave individual card meanings into a cohesive, flowing story that addresses the client's specific situation rather than just listing definitions."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on 'Mundane Translation,' why is removing 'Woo-Woo' jargon critical for professional certification?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the reading shorter and more efficient",
                "It prevents the client from becoming too spiritual",
                "It bridges the gap between esoteric symbols and actionable real-world steps",
                "It allows the reader to charge higher corporate rates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mundane translation ensures that the insights from the cards are grounded in reality, making them useful and 'actionable' for the client's everyday life."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "What is the primary function of the 'Pivot Point' as described in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the card that represents the client's past mistakes",
                "To find the central theme or 'One Big Thing' that connects the entire spread",
                "To determine the exact date an event will occur",
                "To change the subject if the reader gets stuck"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pivot Point is the core message or 'Anchor' of the reading that provides the most significant clarity and connects all other cards to a central theme."

            "id": "q4_4",

                "A warning that the client is lying to the reader"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Contradictory cards usually represent 'Dynamic Tension,' indicating that two seemingly opposite truths are existing simultaneously in the client's life or psyche."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights the 'Executive Summary' approach to structuring delivery. Where should the core message be delivered for maximum impact?",
            "options": [
                "Only at the very end of the session",
                "Upfront (The 'Lead'), then supported by the cards, then summarized",
                "Hidden within the card-by-card descriptions to build suspense",
                "Only if the client asks for a summary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional clarity utilizes the 'Lead' approach—stating the core message early so the client has a framework to understand the supporting details that follow."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In 'Interactive Clarity' (Lesson 6), what is the primary risk of failing to use a feedback loop?",
            "options": [
                "The reader might run out of things to say",
                "The client might ask for a refund",
                "The reader may fall into 'Projection Bias' or 'Cold Reading' traps",
                "The session will last longer than 60 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Without a feedback loop (asking 'How does this resonate?'), the reader risks projecting their own biases onto the cards rather than clarifying the client's actual reality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A professional written report must conclude with clear, actionable steps to ensure the client knows how to apply the clarity they've gained."

                "The external person causing the client's problems",
                "The 'Shadow Anchor'—the internal belief or habit preventing progress",
                "A lack of spiritual protection",
                "The 'bad luck' shown in the cards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Bridge to Liberation requires identifying the 'Shadow Anchor'—the specific internal obstacle that, once addressed, allows the client to move forward."

            "id": "q4_9",

                "'Someone is going to betray you in a business deal soon.'",
                "'Your heart is broken because you love your business too much.'",
                "'There is a necessary 'severing' or painful decision required to stop further loss.'",
                "'You need to do a heart-chakra meditation to heal the business.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Option C translates the esoteric 'heartbreak' of the 3 of Swords into a mundane, actionable business concept: making a difficult cut or decision to prevent further decline."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "According to the module's synthesis principles, what should a reader do if the cards seem to 'mumble' or provide no clear answer?",
            "options": [
                "Keep drawing cards until one makes sense",
                "End the reading and tell the client to come back later",
                "Zoom out to the 'Elemental Dignities' or the 'Majority Suit' to find the underlying energy",
                "Tell the client the spirits are not talking today"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When specific card meanings are muddled, 'zooming out' to look at the overall elemental balance or dominant suit provides a higher-level clarity on the situation's general energy."
