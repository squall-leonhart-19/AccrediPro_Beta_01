            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liberation is the penultimate step of the O.R.A.C.L.E. Framework™, designed to move the seeker from a passive recipient of 'fortune' to an active participant in their own life through empowered choice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying 'Static' allows the practitioner to ground the seeker, ensuring that the reading reflects deeper insights rather than just mirroring the seeker's immediate, ungrounded emotional turbulence."
