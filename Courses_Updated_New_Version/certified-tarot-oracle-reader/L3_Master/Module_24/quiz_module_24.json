            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Energetic Hygiene' is described as a non-negotiable for Master Practitioners. What is the primary purpose of a 'cord-cutting' visualization after a heavy session?",
            "options": [
                "To punish the client for bringing negative energy into the space.",
                "To ensure the practitioner does not carry the client's emotional residue into their personal life.",
                "To prevent the client from booking future sessions.",
                "To increase the practitioner's psychic accuracy for the next client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic hygiene, including cord-cutting, is designed to maintain the practitioner's emotional and energetic sovereignty by releasing the client's narrative and emotional weight."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "A client asks: 'Will my ex-partner come back?' According to Lesson 2, what is the most likely 'Hidden Inquiry' the Master Practitioner should address?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners look beneath the surface question to find the 'Hidden Inquiry,' which usually relates to the client's internal state, such as a need for validation, safety, or closure."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "During a reading, you experience a sudden, sharp constriction in your throat (Somatic Resonance). Based on Lesson 3, what is the most professional way to utilize this information?",
            "options": [

                "Tell the client they have a medical thyroid issue immediately.",
                "Gently ask the client if there is something they feel they are unable to express or speak out loud.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic resonance in the throat often indicates 'unspoken truths.' A Master Practitioner uses this as a prompt to explore the client's communication or self-expression."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "When synthesizing Tarot and Oracle systems (Lesson 4), what is the primary functional difference between the two?",
            "options": [
                "Tarot provides the structural 'How' and 'Why' (archetypal map), while Oracle decks often provide the 'Theme' or 'Atmosphere' (nuance).",
                "Tarot is for negative news and Oracle is only for positive affirmations.",
                "Tarot is for beginners and Oracle is only for Master Practitioners.",
                "There is no difference; they are used identically in all contexts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Tarot offers a fixed archetypal structure (the map), whereas Oracle decks provide fluid, thematic insights that add specific 'flavor' or atmospheric guidance to the reading."

                "A period of intense upheaval will be followed by a mandatory, perhaps forced, period of withdrawal and recovery.",
                "The client will experience a peaceful disaster that causes no stress.",
                "The client should ignore the Tower and focus only on the rest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves synthesizing conflict. The Tower/Four of Swords combination suggests that the 'breakdown' leads directly to a necessary 'break,' emphasizing the cycle of upheaval and integration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners maintain professional boundaries by deferring to experts in specialized fields (law, medicine, finance) while providing spiritual/emotional perspective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes that without proper boundaries and hygiene (Lesson 1), practitioners suffer from 'empathic strain' or burnout by absorbing the client's emotional field."
