            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Working 'IN' the business involves the daily delivery of services (readings), while working 'ON' the business involves high-level strategy, scaling systems, and long-term vision."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 1-to-Many model allows the practitioner to leverage their time. In this case, 20 people x $45 = $900 for 1.5 hours, which is $600/hr, quadrupling the original hourly rate."
