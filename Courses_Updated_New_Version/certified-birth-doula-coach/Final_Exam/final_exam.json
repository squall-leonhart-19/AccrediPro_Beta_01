            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'C' in the C.R.A.D.L.E. Framework™ stands for Connection & Intake. Its goal is to build the coach-client alliance and understand the psychological and historical context of the client's pregnancy to tailor future support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2017 Cochrane review (n=15,858) found that continuous support from a doula significantly reduced the risk of Cesarean birth by approximately 39% and increased the likelihood of a spontaneous vaginal birth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hands and knees positioning uses gravity to pull the fetal back away from the maternal spine, creating space for the fetus to rotate from an OP to an OA (Occiput Anterior) position."

                "It chemically blocks the release of oxytocin in the brain.",

                "It physically pushes the fetus away from the nerve endings in the lower back.",
                "It numbs the peripheral nerves through localized pressure-induced ischemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gate Control Theory suggests that non-painful sensory input (like counter-pressure) can travel faster to the brain than pain signals, effectively blocking or 'closing the gate' to the perception of pain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doula advocacy is about facilitating communication and protecting client autonomy, not speaking for the client or providing medical advice. Encouraging the client to ask questions or use the B.R.A.I.N. tool is the standard of care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional Integration involves 'debriefing' the birth. This helps the client integrate the experience into their identity, promotes healing from any perceived trauma, and allows for early screening of postpartum depression or anxiety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas do not perform clinical tasks or give medical advice. For high-risk clients, the focus remains on comfort, emotional support, and helping the client understand the medical protocols being implemented."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees together, ankles apart) helps widen the pelvic outlet, which is crucial for the final stages of fetal descent and pushing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transition is the most intense phase of the first stage of labor. Physical signs like shaking, vomiting, and psychological signs like the 'loss of control' or wanting to go home are classic indicators."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VBAC clients need accurate, evidence-based information regarding the risks (such as uterine rupture, which is less than 1%) and benefits of vaginal birth to make an informed choice and feel confident in their decision."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both provide support, the 'Coach' model emphasizes a structured methodology (like C.R.A.D.L.E.) to build the client's internal resources, knowledge, and self-advocacy skills throughout the childbearing year."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In an emergency or precipitous birth, the doula remains calm, ensures the client is in a safe position (like on the floor or bed), and provides emotional reassurance. They should never attempt to delay the birth or perform clinical interventions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asynclitism occurs when the fetal head is tilted. Doulas use asymmetric positions (like the 'Captain Morgan' or side-lying release) to help realign the head and facilitate descent."
