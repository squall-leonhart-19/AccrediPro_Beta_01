            "question": "In the C.R.A.D.L.E. framework, which component is prioritized when a doula is navigating a high-stakes clinical emergency to ensure the birthing person's autonomy is preserved?",
            "options": [
                "Communication: Using 'The Pause' to slow down the room's energy",
                "Advocacy: Directly challenging the primary surgeon's medical decision",
                "Regulation: Managing the doula's own nervous system to prevent emotional contagion",
                "Logistics: Managing the physical space to ensure family presence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Master-level integration of C.R.A.D.L.E. emphasizes that 'The Pause' in communication is the most effective tool for preventing 'tunnel vision' in clinical staff and preserving the client's ability to provide informed consent during emergencies."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Influence without Authority' model for systemic advocacy, what is the most effective way for a doula to influence hospital culture regarding delayed cord clamping protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Distributing printed evidence-based research to all nurses on the floor",
                "Building 'Social Capital' through consistent, professional collaboration and inter-disciplinary respect",
                "Filing formal grievances every time a protocol is not followed",
                "Encouraging clients to refuse all care until the protocol is changed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic advocacy relies on social capital. By building rapport and demonstrating professional excellence, doulas gain the 'ear' of stakeholders, making institutional change more likely than through adversarial methods."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "A client is in the second stage of labor with a fetus in a persistent Occiput Posterior (OP) position. Which biomechanical maneuver is specifically designed to open the pelvic outlet and encourage internal rotation?",
            "options": [
                "The Walcher's Position",
                "The Miles Circuit",
                "Exaggerated Sims with internal rotation of the femur (knees in, heels out)",
                "External rotation of the femur (knees out, heels in)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the pelvic outlet (lower mid-pelvis), internal rotation of the femur (knees in, heels out) actually widens the intertuberous diameter, providing more space for an OP baby to rotate or descend."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis on birth trauma prevention suggests that the 'Quality of Provider Interaction' is a higher predictor of PTSD than the actual mode of delivery. How does a Master Doula apply this?",
            "options": [
                "By ensuring the client has a vaginal birth at all costs",
                "By facilitating 'Relational Repair' in the room through immediate processing of clinical interactions",
                "By taking over all communication so the client doesn't have to speak to providers",
                "By focusing exclusively on physical comfort measures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves 'Deep Processing'—facilitating immediate relational repair and ensuring the client feels heard and respected during the event, which significantly reduces the risk of long-term trauma (PTSD)."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "In the 'Business of Mastery' framework, what is the primary purpose of the 'Scaling Impact' phase for a veteran doula?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the number of births attended personally to 10+ per month",
                "To transition from a 'Time-for-Money' model to a 'Value-Based' or 'Leveraged' model",
                "To lower prices to attract a higher volume of low-risk clients",
                "To eliminate all administrative tasks by hiring a full-time virtual assistant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional longevity is achieved by moving away from the physical toll of 24/7 on-call work and toward leveraged models like agencies, education, or specialized consulting that provide value without requiring constant physical presence."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "When supporting a client with a dense epidural, research indicates that 'Passive Descent' (laboring down) for up to 2 hours can result in which outcome compared to immediate pushing?",
            "options": [
                "A 25% increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage",
                "A significant decrease in the duration of active pushing and lower rates of instrumental delivery",
                "An increased likelihood of fetal heart rate decelerations",
                "No statistical difference in any birth outcome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrative pharmacology teaches that laboring down allows the uterus to do the work of descent, significantly reducing maternal exhaustion and the need for forceps or vacuum extraction."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "A client decides on an 'Informed Refusal' of a recommended Cesarean for failure to progress. What is the doula's ethical 'Line of Demarcation' in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "The doula must convince the client to follow medical advice to avoid liability",
                "The doula should leave the room to avoid being associated with the refusal",
                "The doula supports the client’s right to refuse while ensuring the client has heard the risks/benefits and documenting the support provided",
                "The doula should provide medical counter-arguments to the doctor’s recommendation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Complex Ethics' lesson emphasizes that doulas support the *process* of informed refusal. The doula does not give medical advice but ensures the client's decision is documented and that the client remains supported emotionally."

        {
            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "The 'C.R.A.D.L.E. Audit' is a master-level tool used post-birth. What is its primary function?",
            "options": [
                "To provide the client with a detailed medical timeline for their records",
                "To identify gaps in the doula's own self-regulation and advocacy effectiveness for professional growth",
                "To bill the client based on the number of interventions used",
                "To report hospital staff to the nursing board for protocol violations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Audit is a reflective tool for the practitioner to evaluate their performance across the six C.R.A.D.L.E. domains, ensuring continuous improvement and preventing burnout through objective analysis."

        {
            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "During a 'Master Integration' case study: A client is experiencing a 'stalled' second stage at +1 station. The doula suggests an asymmetrical position (like a side-lying release). What is the physiological goal of this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the surge frequency through nipple stimulation",
                "To create space in the mid-pelvis by releasing the sacrotuberous ligaments and correcting asynclitism",
                "To sedate the client so they can sleep through the stall",
                "To move the baby back up to the fundus to start over"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced biomechanics focuses on resolving malpositioning. Asymmetrical positions and releases target specific pelvic ligaments and help correct asynclitism (tilted head), allowing the baby to navigate the mid-pelvis."

        {
            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Integrative Pharmacology,' how does a doula best support a client who has just received IV Pitocin for augmentation?",
            "options": [
                "By insisting the Pitocin be turned off every 30 minutes",
                "By increasing physical counter-pressure and 'doubling down' on relaxation techniques to match the increased intensity",
                "By telling the client that the Pitocin will likely lead to a Cesarean",
                "By stopping all support as the labor is now 'medicalized'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery in medicated labors involves adapting support to the chemical reality. Pitocin increases intensity; therefore, the doula must increase the 'dosage' of comfort measures and regulation to help the client stay on top of the waves."
