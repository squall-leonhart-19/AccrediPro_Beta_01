            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that 60% to 80% of people who attempt a TOLAC will achieve a successful vaginal birth, making it a statistically viable option for many."

            "question": "A client with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is entering the transition phase of labor. They are becoming increasingly agitated by the sound of the fetal monitor and the smell of the hospital's cleaning solution. What is the most effective trauma-informed doula intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to 'push through' the sensory discomfort to focus on the baby.",
                "Implementing sensory management by requesting the monitor volume be lowered and using a scent-free environment or preferred essential oil.",
                "Asking the nurse to increase the Pitocin to speed up the labor process.",
                "Telling the client that these smells and sounds are a normal part of the hospital experience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent clients often experience sensory processing differences; minimizing overwhelming stimuli (sensory management) is a core doula strategy for preventing a sensory meltdown."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MoDi twins share a placenta but are in separate sacs. This requires closer monitoring for Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) than dichorionic twins."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation or the 'freeze' response is a common survival mechanism for trauma survivors when they feel threatened or triggered, often occurring during invasive physical exams."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the doula supports the entire birth team, the primary 'patient' requiring physical comfort, advocacy, and labor support is the person performing the labor: the gestational carrier."
