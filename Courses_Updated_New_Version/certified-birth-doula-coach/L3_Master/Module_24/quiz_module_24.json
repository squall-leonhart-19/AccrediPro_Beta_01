            "question": "A Master Doula utilizes 'Somatic Co-Regulation' to stabilize a panicked client. Which physiological mechanism is primarily being engaged to lower the client's heart rate variability (HRV)?",
            "options": [
                "The sympathetic 'fight or flight' response",
                "The Ventral Vagal complex of the parasympathetic nervous system",
                "The HPA axis cortisol production",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners use their own regulated nervous system to influence the client's Ventral Vagal complex, promoting a state of social engagement and safety."

                "Identifying the client's desire to leave the facility AMA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LISA (Listen, Identify, Solve, Agree) requires identifying the 'why' behind the conflict—such as a nurse's fear of liability or a policy constraint—to find a collaborative solution."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "During a trauma-informed intake, you identify a client has a 'Dismissive-Avoidant' attachment style. How is this most likely to manifest during active labor?",
            "options": [

                "Frequent verbalization of fears and emotional vulnerability",
                "A preference for solitude and a potential rejection of physical touch or 'cooing' support",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A baby is confirmed to be in a Deep Transverse Arrest at +1 station. Which pelvic level must the Doula target to facilitate rotation and descent?",

                "The False Pelvis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A +1 station indicates the baby is in the mid-pelvis. Techniques like the side-lying release or asymmetric lunges are needed to create space at this specific level."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "The Gate Control Theory of Pain suggests that neuro-modulation techniques (like TENS or sterile water injections) work by:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-modulation provides non-painful sensory input that travels faster to the brain than pain signals, effectively blocking or 'gating' the pain perception."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'C' in CRADLE stands for Containment. In a crisis, the Doula's first job is to manage the environment, ensuring the medical team can work while keeping the partner from being physically in the way."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To open the outlet (bottom of the pelvis), internal rotation of the femurs (knees in) actually closes the outlet; external rotation (knees out/squatting) is required to widen the sitz bones."
