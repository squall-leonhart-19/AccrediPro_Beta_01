            "question": "In the context of the 'Cascade of Intervention,' which secondary intervention is most statistically likely to follow the administration of an epidural due to its effect on endogenous oxytocin?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate Cesarean section",
                "Synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin) augmentation",
                "Manual rotation of the fetus",
                "Spontaneous rupture of membranes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epidurals often slow down labor by inhibiting the natural surge of oxytocin (the Ferguson Reflex), frequently leading to the medical recommendation of Pitocin to regain labor patterns."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client is being pressured into an induction at 39 weeks solely due to a BMI of 34. According to evidence-based care discussed in Lesson 3, what is the most appropriate advocacy strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Agree with the provider as BMI over 30 is an automatic high-risk category",
                "Suggest the client request a 'Bishop Score' assessment to determine cervical readiness",
                "Advise the client to change providers immediately",
                "Recommend an elective Cesarean to avoid labor complications"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Bishop Score assesses cervical readiness; evidence suggests that inducing an unfavorable cervix in high-BMI clients significantly increases the risk of Cesarean, whereas BMI alone is not a medical indication for early induction."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "When supporting a client during a Trial of Labor After Cesarean (TOLAC), what is the most critical physiological sign a doula should monitor that might indicate uterine rupture?",
            "options": [
                "Increased urge to push",
                "Sudden, sharp pain at the scar site that persists between contractions",
                "A sudden burst of energy (nesting instinct)",
                "The 'bloody show'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While rare (0.5-0.9% risk), sudden localized pain at the previous incision site that does not subside between contractions is a potential warning sign of uterine dehiscence or rupture."

                "3 hours",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Precipitous labor is clinically defined as an exceptionally rapid labor and birth lasting less than 3 hours from the onset of regular contractions."

            "options": [
                "Ensuring the doula can perform the surgical scrub",
                "Requesting the use of a clear drape or lowering the drape for the birth",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Gentle Cesarean' emphasizes the birth experience, including visual contact (clear drapes) and immediate skin-to-skin contact in the OR if both mother and baby are stable."

            "options": [
                "The time between the first contraction and the first birth",
                "The time between the birth of Twin A and Twin B, requiring continued emotional support",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The inter-twin interval is the time between the two births. Doulas must support the parent through a 'second transition' as they often experience a lull followed by a rapid return of intense contractions."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "A client experiencing a stillbirth (Lesson 7) asks if they should see the baby. What is the most evidence-based, trauma-informed response for a doula?",

                "Advise them not to, as it might be too traumatic",
                "Encourage them to see the baby only if the baby looks 'normal'",
                "Gently offer the opportunity, explaining they can change their mind, and support 'memory making' at their pace",
                "Tell them the hospital policy usually forbids it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care involves offering choices without pressure, allowing the parents to lead the process of 'memory making' and saying goodbye."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "For a client with a high BMI, which labor position is specifically recommended in Lesson 3 to utilize gravity while reducing the ergonomic strain on the birthing person's joints?",
            "options": [
                "Flat on the back (Lithotomy)",
                "Side-lying with the top leg supported by a peanut ball",
                "Standing for the duration of the 10-hour labor",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Side-lying with a peanut ball is excellent for high-BMI clients as it opens the pelvic outlet, encourages rotation, and provides physical rest without the risks associated with supine positions."

            "options": [
                "To argue with the doctor on behalf of the client",
                "To facilitate a conversation where the client uses the BRAIN acronym to make an informed choice",
                "To physically prevent the nurse from administering medication",
                "To tell the client they must refuse the intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The doula's role in advocacy is to empower the client to use tools like BRAIN (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Nothing) to ensure informed consent and maintain their autonomy."

            "id": "q13_10",
