            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "When utilizing the BRAIN acronym to facilitate informed consent, what does the 'I' specifically represent in the context of the birthing person's autonomy?",
            "options": ["Intervention", "Information", "Intuition", "Implications"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the BRAIN acronym (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Nothing), 'Intuition' encourages the client to check in with their internal guidance and feelings about the proposed procedure, which is a vital part of person-centered care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which hormone is inhibited by the 'fight or flight' response (catecholamines) and requires a dark, private, and safe environment to reach peak levels for effective labor contractions?",
            "options": ["Prolactin", "Oxytocin", "Progesterone", "Cortisol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, often called the 'shy hormone,' is easily inhibited by adrenaline and catecholamines. For physiological labor to progress, the birthing person needs to feel safe to allow oxytocin levels to rise."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "During the 'Transition' phase of the first stage of labor, which emotional sign is most commonly observed by doulas as a physiological marker of progress?",
            "options": ["Extreme talkativeness and excitement", "A sudden sense of calm and sleepiness", "Statements like 'I can't do this anymore' or 'Take me home'", "Increased focus on social media and external environment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transition (8-10cm dilation) is often marked by a significant emotional shift where the birthing person may feel overwhelmed, irritable, or express a desire to give up, signaling that the second stage is near."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to a 2017 Cochrane review, what is the primary outcome of using continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) for low-risk women compared to intermittent auscultation?",
            "options": ["A significant decrease in neonatal seizures", "A significant reduction in cerebral palsy rates", "No improvement in neonatal outcomes but an increase in Cesarean sections", "A decrease in the use of epidurals"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Large-scale data shows that CEFM in low-risk pregnancies does not improve long-term neonatal outcomes but does correlate with higher rates of surgical interventions like C-sections."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A Bishop Score is used to determine the likelihood of a successful induction. What score generally indicates that the cervix is 'ripe' and an induction is likely to result in a vaginal birth?",
            "options": ["3 or lower", "Between 4 and 5", "8 or higher", "Exactly 6"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Bishop Score of 8 or higher suggests the cervix is favorable (ripe) and the chances of a successful vaginal delivery following induction are similar to those of spontaneous labor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "What is the most common side effect of an epidural that requires proactive management with IV fluids and frequent blood pressure monitoring?",
            "options": ["Maternal hypertension", "Maternal hypotension", "Fetal tachycardia", "Hyperventilation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maternal hypotension (a drop in blood pressure) is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia, which can lead to reduced placental perfusion and fetal heart rate decelerations if not managed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "When an instrumental delivery (vacuum or forceps) is proposed, which 'Alternative' should a doula help the client explore if the situation is not an immediate emergency?",
            "options": ["Immediate Cesarean section", "Changing maternal positions to open the pelvic outlet", "Increasing the Pitocin dosage immediately", "Requesting a different doctor"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Changing positions (such as moving to an upright or asymmetrical position) can often resolve fetal malpositioning or descent issues, potentially avoiding the need for instrumental assistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a birth plan within the 'Rights & Education' framework of the Certified Birth Doula Coach™?",
            "options": ["To create a legally binding contract with the hospital", "To ensure the doctor follows every instruction perfectly", "To serve as a communication tool and educational catalyst during pregnancy", "To prevent any medical interventions from occurring"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The birth plan is a tool for education and communication. Its value lies in the discussions it triggers between the parents and their care providers before labor begins."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "If a client is experiencing 'Failure to Progress' during the active phase of labor, which evidence-based approach is recommended before moving to a surgical birth?",
            "options": ["Strict bed rest to conserve energy", "The 'Rest and Be Thankful' phase", "The use of hydrotherapy and movement to encourage fetal rotation", "Immediate rupture of membranes (AROM)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Movement and hydrotherapy are evidence-based methods to encourage labor progress and fetal positioning, whereas strict bed rest often slows labor further."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of 'Informed Refusal' in a hospital setting?",
            "options": ["A client signing a generic consent form upon admission", "A client deciding not to have a Hep B vaccine for their newborn after being told the risks and benefits", "A nurse performing a cervical check without asking", "A doctor performing an episiotomy during an emergency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed refusal is the right of the patient to decline a treatment or procedure after being fully informed of the consequences of that refusal."
