            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to the Gate Control Theory of Pain discussed in Lesson 1, how does counter-pressure effectively reduce labor pain perception?",
            "options": [
                "It chemically neutralizes the production of prostaglandins in the uterus.",
                "Non-painful tactile stimuli travel faster along large-diameter nerve fibers, 'closing the gate' to slower pain signals.",
                "It forces the fetus into an anterior position, immediately ending the pain stimulus.",
                "It triggers an immediate 50% drop in maternal cortisol levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gate Control Theory suggests that the brain can only process a limited amount of information at once; counter-pressure provides tactile input that reaches the brain faster than pain signals, effectively blocking or 'closing the gate' to the pain."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "When applying a Double Hip Squeeze for a client experiencing intense back labor (Lesson 2), where should the Doula's hands be positioned for maximum efficacy?",
            "options": [
                "Directly on the spine at the L4-L5 vertebrae.",
                "On the iliac crests, pulling outward toward the hips.",
                "On the fleshy part of the buttocks (gluteus medius), pressing inward and slightly upward toward the sacrum.",
                "On the lower ribs to encourage deeper diaphragmatic breathing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Hip Squeeze is most effective when pressure is applied to the gluteal muscles, pushing the pelvic bones inward and upward to provide counter-pressure against the sacrum where the fetal head may be pressing."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Research on hydrotherapy (Lesson 3) suggests that immersion in water during the active phase of labor can reduce the use of epidural analgesia by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "30-40%",
                "Over 60%",
                "It has no statistically significant effect on epidural rates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies, including Cochrane reviews, indicate that hydrotherapy in active labor is associated with a 30-40% reduction in the use of pharmacological pain relief like epidurals."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Sensory Modulation), why is 'Environmental Design' focused on reducing neocortical stimulation?",
            "options": [
                "The neocortex is responsible for producing adrenaline, which speeds up labor too quickly.",
                "Overstimulation of the neocortex (the 'thinking brain') can trigger the sympathetic nervous system, inhibiting oxytocin flow.",
                "The neocortex must be fully active for the mother to remain conscious during transition.",
                "It allows the Doula to take over the decision-making process for the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Labor is controlled by the primitive brain (hypothalamus/pituitary). High levels of light, noise, or complex questions stimulate the neocortex, which can trigger a 'fight or flight' response that stalls oxytocin production."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "During Lesson 5, you learned about vocalization. Why are low-pitched, guttural sounds encouraged over high-pitched screaming during the second stage of labor?",
            "options": [
                "Low sounds are quieter and less likely to disturb other patients in the hospital.",
                "High-pitched sounds are associated with the 'Valsalva Maneuver,' which is the only way to push.",
                "There is a physiological link between the jaw and the pelvic floor; a relaxed, open jaw (low sounds) encourages a relaxed, open pelvic floor.",
                "Low sounds increase the mother's heart rate, providing more oxygen to the fetus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'sphincter law' suggests that tension in the mouth and jaw correlates with tension in the cervix and pelvic floor. Low, open vocalizations help maintain relaxation in the birth canal."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "When using a Rebozo for 'Sifting' (Lesson 6), what is the primary safety precaution the Doula must observe?",
            "options": [
                "Never use the Rebozo if the mother is in a side-lying position.",
                "Ensure the Rebozo is placed over the bony pelvis/hips, not the soft tissue of the upper abdomen.",
                "The sifting motion must be at least 120 beats per minute to be effective.",
                "Only use the Rebozo after the administration of an epidural."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To ensure safety and comfort, the Rebozo should cradle the abdomen with the pressure distributed across the hips and pelvic bones, avoiding direct, heavy pressure on the upper abdominal organs or the fundus."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which acupressure point (Lesson 7) is located in the webbing between the thumb and forefinger and is used to strengthen contractions and provide general pain relief?",
            "options": [
                "SP6 (Sanyinjiao)",
                "BL60 (Kunlun)",
                "LI4 (Hegu)",
                "K1 (Yongquan)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LI4 (Large Intestine 4) is a well-known point for moving energy downward, strengthening uterine contractions, and providing significant analgesic effects during labor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A client is experiencing a 'stalled' labor at 6cm dilation and is feeling discouraged. Applying the 'Dynamic Comfort' framework (Lesson 8), what is the Doula's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest an immediate epidural to allow the client to rest.",
                "Assess the 'Three Ps' (Passenger, Passage, Power) and suggest a position change to optimize fetal alignment.",
                "Tell the client that stalling is a sign that the body isn't ready and they should go home.",
                "Perform a vaginal exam to check for cervical effacement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dynamic Comfort involves assessing the physiological cause of discomfort or stall (the 3 Ps) and using movement or positioning (Passage/Passenger) to encourage progress before moving to pharmacological interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Thermal Modulation' (Lesson 3), when is the application of a cold compress to the perineum most beneficial?",
            "options": [
                "During the first stage of labor to prevent early dilation.",
                "During the 'Rest and Thankful' phase before pushing begins.",
                "During the 'crowning' phase of the second stage to reduce the burning sensation and swelling.",
                "Cold should never be used on the perineum as it causes tissue tearing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cold compresses applied to the perineum during crowning can provide a numbing effect (analgesia) and help reduce the inflammatory response and swelling of the tissues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Dynamic Comfort Plan' (Lesson 8), how should a Doula handle advocacy when a nurse insists a client must remain in bed for continuous monitoring?",
            "options": [
                "Argue with the nurse until they leave the room.",
                "Quietly tell the client to ignore the nurse's instructions.",
                "Ask the nurse: 'Is there a way we can use the monitors while the client is on the birth ball or standing?'",
                "Immediately call the hospital administrator to report a violation of rights."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional advocacy involves facilitating a solution that maintains the client's comfort goals (movement) while respecting the medical team's need for safety (monitoring), often through 'bridging' questions."
