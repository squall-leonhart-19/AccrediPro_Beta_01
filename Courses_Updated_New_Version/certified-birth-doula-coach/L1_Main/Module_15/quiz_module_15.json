            "question": "When a medical provider attempts to perform an intervention without clear consent, which 'soft advocacy' technique is most effective for a doula to use to preserve the provider-patient relationship while protecting the client?",
            "options": [
                "Directly telling the provider they are violating the law",
                "Asking for a 'pause' or five minutes of private time for the couple to discuss the BRAIN acronym",
                "Physically stepping between the provider and the client",
                "Reporting the provider to the head of nursing immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asking for a 'pause' or private time allows the birthing person to regain autonomy and process information without direct confrontation, which is a hallmark of effective doula advocacy."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the BRAIN acronym used for informed consent, what does the 'I' represent, and why is it critical in a high-stakes labor scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Intervention; to understand the mechanics of the procedure",
                "Insurance; to ensure the procedure is covered",
                "Intuition; to encourage the birthing person to check in with their internal guidance",
                "Immediate; to determine if the procedure must happen right now"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'I' stands for Intuition. In high-stakes scenarios, medical data can be overwhelming; checking in with one's intuition helps the birthing person align the decision with their personal values."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to research on the 'Cascade of Interventions' in medically managed labors, what is a common physiological consequence of early epidural administration?",
            "options": [
                "Increased maternal mobility",
                "Higher likelihood of needing synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin) to augment slowed contractions",
                "Immediate decrease in the risk of C-section",
                "Spontaneous increase in natural endorphin production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epidurals often slow down labor by inhibiting natural movement and hormonal flow, frequently leading to the use of Pitocin to maintain labor progress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cervical exams can be highly triggering for survivors. Trauma-informed care requires explicit permission, explanation, and the ability for the client to stop the exam at any time."

                "Competence is a lifelong process; Humility is a finished goal",
                "Competence focuses on 'mastering' a culture; Humility focuses on self-reflection and addressing power imbalances",
                "Humility is only for medical staff; Competence is for doulas",
                "There is no functional difference between the two terms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility is a lifelong commitment to self-critique and acknowledging that the client is the expert on their own culture and experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Birth trauma is subjective. A medically 'perfect' birth can be traumatic if the person felt silenced or unsafe, while a high-intervention birth can be empowering if they felt supported."

                "It causes a sharp rise in blood pressure to prevent fainting",
                "It stimulates uterine contractions to safely expel the placenta and minimize hemorrhage",
                "It suppresses the production of colostrum",
                "It helps the body metabolize the epidural medication faster"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The massive surge of oxytocin immediately after birth is vital for placental delivery and uterine involution, which prevents excessive bleeding."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious trauma is the emotional residue of exposure to the trauma of others. It requires active boundaries and self-care strategies to manage."

            "options": [
                "Tell the doctor that the client refuses the induction",
                "Encourage the client to ask: 'What happens if we do nothing for 24-48 hours?'",
                "Advise the client to leave the hospital immediately",
                "Agree with the doctor to avoid conflict"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asking 'What if we do nothing?' (the 'N' in BRAIN) helps the client understand the actual urgency versus hospital policy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doulas amplify the client's voice. This ensures that the medical staff acknowledges the client's stated needs and concerns, which is critical for those facing systemic disparities."
