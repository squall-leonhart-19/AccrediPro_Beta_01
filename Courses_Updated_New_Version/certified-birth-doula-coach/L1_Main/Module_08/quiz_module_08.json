            "question": "In the context of the 'Neuroscience of the Fourth Trimester,' research indicates that the maternal brain undergoes significant 'synaptic pruning.' What is the primary functional purpose of this reduction in gray matter?",
            "options": [
                "To compensate for the 'mom brain' cognitive decline caused by sleep deprivation",
                "To increase the efficiency of neural circuits dedicated to social cognition and theory of mind",
                "To reduce the metabolic demands of the brain during high lactation periods",
                "To eliminate traumatic memories associated with the intensity of the labor process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synaptic pruning in the maternal brain is not a sign of loss, but of specialization. It streamlines neural pathways to enhance the mother's ability to interpret infant cues and empathize with her child's needs."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "When facilitating the 'Processing of the Birth Narrative' (L2), which concept describes the window of time where a memory becomes labial and can be updated with new emotional meaning?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Dissonance Window",
                "The Narrative Arc",
                "Memory Reconsolidation",
                "The Refractory Period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Memory reconsolidation is the neurobiological process where retrieved memories can be modified before being stored again, allowing coaches to help clients shift the emotional charge of a traumatic birth story."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to current research on Obstetric Violence (L3), what is the most significant predictor of a birthing person developing PTSD-like symptoms post-birth?",
            "options": [
                "The use of emergency pharmacological interventions",
                "The total duration of the second stage of labor",
                "The subjective perception of lack of agency and loss of autonomy",
                "The physical severity of perineal tearing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that the 'subjective experience'—specifically feeling unheard, coerced, or invisible—is a stronger predictor of birth trauma than the actual medical interventions performed."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "In the 'Dance of Attunement' (L4), what does the term 'Rupture and Repair' refer to in the coach-client or parent-infant relationship?",
            "options": [
                "The physical healing of the pelvic floor after a traumatic delivery",
                "The inevitable moments of miscommunication followed by the intentional act of reconnecting",
                "The breakdown of the birth plan and the subsequent legal mediation",
                "The transition from the 'honeymoon phase' of postpartum to the 'reality phase'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rupture and repair is a core concept in attachment theory. It suggests that perfect attunement is impossible; the strength of the bond is built through the process of noticing a disconnect and working to fix it."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which specific symptom is a hallmark of 'Secondary Traumatic Stress' (STS) that distinguishes it from general 'Burnout' for a Doula Coach?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While burnout is characterized by exhaustion and cynicism, STS (or Vicarious Trauma) involves symptoms that mimic PTSD, such as intrusive thoughts or avoidance of triggers related to a client's trauma."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Within the CRADLE framework (L6), the 'E' stands for Endocrinology and Emotions. How does the coach apply the 'Endocrinology' component during a postpartum visit?",
            "options": [
                "By drawing blood to test progesterone and estrogen levels",
                "By prescribing oxytocin nasal sprays to assist with the let-down reflex",
                "By educating the client on how the 'progesterone drop' triggers the 'Baby Blues' around day 3-5",
                "By recommending specific hormonal birth control methods to stabilize mood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doula Coaches do not diagnose or prescribe. They apply endocrinology through education, helping clients normalize the physiological shifts (like the Day 3 hormone drop) that impact emotional health."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'precipitous labor' (under 3 hours) and reports feeling 'detached' and 'numb.' Which Advanced Case Management (L7) strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to ignore the birth and focus only on the baby",
                "Utilizing 'Sensory Grounding' to help the client integrate the rapid physiological shift into their conscious narrative",
                "Advising the client that they should be grateful for a fast labor compared to long ones",
                "Immediately referring to a psychiatrist for antipsychotic medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Precipitous labor can cause a 'neuro-psychological lag' where the mind hasn't processed what the body has done. Sensory grounding helps bridge this gap and promotes integration."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Under the 'Ethics and Standards' (L8) of the Certified Birth Doula Coach™, what is the 'Scope of Practice' boundary regarding Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs)?",

                "The coach may diagnose PPD if they use a validated tool like the Edinburgh Scale",

                "The coach screens for symptoms, normalizes the experience, and facilitates a referral to a clinical mental health professional",
                "The coach should avoid discussing mental health to prevent overstepping into medicine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach's role is 'Screen and Refer.' They use their knowledge to identify red flags and provide the bridge to clinical care without attempting to treat or diagnose themselves."

                "Primarily motivated by hunger rather than social connection",
                "Better at self-soothing when parents maintain a neutral, 'still' expression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Still Face Experiment shows that even very young infants are active participants in social interaction and become visibly distressed when a caregiver stops responding to their cues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While self-advocacy is for the individual, systemic advocacy looks at the 'macro' level, seeking to improve the birth culture and institutional systems for everyone."
