            "question": "The 'Ferguson Reflex' is a key physiological component of the second stage of labor. What primary hormonal trigger defines this reflex?",
            "options": [
                "A drop in progesterone causing uterine irritability",
                "The surge of oxytocin caused by fetal pressure on the pelvic floor and vaginal walls",
                "The release of adrenaline to provide the 'fetus ejection' energy",
                "A spike in relaxin to soften the pubic symphysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ferguson Reflex is a positive feedback loop where pressure on the internal functional os or vaginal walls triggers the posterior pituitary to release oxytocin, increasing uterine contractions."

            "question": "To specifically widen the pelvic OUTLET during the final stages of pushing, which maternal positioning adjustment is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "External rotation of the femurs (knees out, heels in)",
                "Deep squatting with a wide stance",
                "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out)",
                "Lying flat on the back with legs in stirrups"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While external rotation opens the pelvic inlet, internal rotation of the knees/femurs widens the pelvic outlet by increasing the distance between the ischial tuberosities."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Research comparing Valsalva (directed) pushing to spontaneous (open-glottis) pushing has shown that prolonged Valsalva pushing is associated with:",

                "Increased risk of fetal heart rate decelerations and lower umbilical cord pH",
                "A significantly shorter second stage of labor by over 60 minutes",
                "Reduced risk of pelvic floor trauma and urinary incontinence",
                "Higher maternal satisfaction scores due to a sense of control"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Valsalva pushing can reduce maternal cardiac output and placental perfusion, leading to potential fetal oxygenation issues and lower pH levels."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a classic clinical sign that the placenta has separated from the uterine wall during the third stage?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Signs of placental separation include a globular-shaped uterus, a gush of blood, and the lengthening of the umbilical cord as it descends."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "If a client experiences a shoulder dystocia, the 'Gaskin Maneuver' is often recommended. What does this maneuver involve?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gaskin Maneuver involves moving the mother to her hands and knees, which can change the pelvic diameters and allow the trapped shoulder to dislodge."

            "question": "A client with an epidural reaches 10cm dilation but the baby is at +1 station and the client feels no urge to push. Based on the concept of 'Laboring Down,' what is the best evidence-based suggestion?",
            "options": [
                "Begin directed pushing immediately to prevent the epidural from wearing off",
                "Turn off the epidural immediately to regain sensation",
                "Delayed pushing for 1-2 hours or until the client feels a reflex urge",
                "Perform an immediate episiotomy to clear the path for descent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Laboring down (delayed pushing) allows for passive fetal descent, reducing the time spent actively pushing and decreasing maternal exhaustion without increasing the risk of C-section."
