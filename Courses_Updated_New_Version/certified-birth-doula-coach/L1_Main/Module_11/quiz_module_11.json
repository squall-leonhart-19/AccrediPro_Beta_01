            "question": "A client with severe preeclampsia is being administered Magnesium Sulfate. What is the doula's primary role in this medically complex scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Monitoring the IV pump to ensure the dosage is correct.",
                "Providing emotional support and managing the environment to reduce overstimulation, as the client may be sensitive to light and sound.",
                "Encouraging the client to walk the halls to speed up labor despite the IV restriction.",
                "Advising the client on natural alternatives to Magnesium Sulfate to avoid side effects."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium Sulfate is a central nervous system depressant used to prevent seizures. Clients often feel very ill and are sensitive to stimuli; the doula's role is to maintain a calm, low-light environment and provide comfort measures within the constraints of medical monitoring."

            "options": [
                "The doula performing the surgical scrub to assist the surgeon.",
                "Ensuring the operating room remains completely silent throughout the procedure.",
                "Requesting the use of a clear drape or lowering the drape at the moment of birth to allow the parents to see the baby.",
                "Insisting that the father/partner remains in the waiting room to keep the OR sterile."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A gentle cesarean prioritizes the family's experience, often involving lowering the surgical drape, immediate skin-to-skin contact in the OR, and keeping the mother's arms free."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "When supporting a twin birth, what is the 'inter-delivery interval' and why is it significant for the doula?",
            "options": [
                "The time between the start of contractions and full dilation; it is longer in multiples.",
                "The time elapsed between the birth of the first twin and the second twin; the doula must provide continued support as labor 're-starts' for the second baby.",
                "The time between the administration of an epidural and the start of pushing.",
                "The time it takes for the placenta to detach after both babies are born."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The inter-delivery interval is the gap between the birth of Twin A and Twin B. Doulas must support the mother through a second 'transition' phase, which can be emotionally and physically taxing."

            "id": "q11_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that approximately 60-80% of women who attempt a TOLAC will achieve a successful vaginal birth (VBAC)."

            "options": [
                "The cervix is 'ripe' and the induction is highly likely to result in a vaginal birth.",
                "The cervix is 'unripe,' and the medical team will likely need to use cervical ripening agents (like prostaglandins) before starting Pitocin.",
                "The baby is in a breech position and an immediate Cesarean is required.",
                "The client is already in active labor and no induction is necessary."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Bishop Score of 6 or less indicates an 'unfavorable' or unripe cervix, suggesting that cervical ripening is necessary to increase the chances of a successful induction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bereavement support requires honest, sensitive language. Avoiding 'clinical' euphemisms and using the baby's name helps parents process the reality of their loss and validates their parenthood."

                "On the Intended Parents (IPs), ensuring they are comfortable in the waiting room.",
                "On the Gestational Carrier (the person giving birth), as they are the patient undergoing the physical process of labor.",
                "On the hospital staff to ensure the legal paperwork is filed correctly.",
                "Equally between the surrogate and the Intended Parents at all times."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the doula supports the entire 'birth team,' the physical support (massage, positioning, comfort measures) is directed at the gestational carrier who is performing the physical work of labor."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Bridge from E to C' is a framework for helping high-risk clients transition from the 'Emergency' mindset of a complex pregnancy/birth to a 'Calm' and supported postpartum recovery."

            "question": "When a medical provider suggests an unplanned intervention, the doula encourages the client to use the BRAIN acronym. What does the 'N' stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Negotiate the price of the procedure.",
                "Notice the heart rate of the baby.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the BRAIN acronym (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Nothing), the 'N' stands for 'Nothing'—asking what the risks/benefits are of waiting or doing nothing for a set period (e.g., 30-60 minutes)."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Uterine rupture is the most serious, though rare (less than 1%), risk associated with VBAC. Doulas should be aware of the signs, such as sudden sharp pain or changes in the fetal heart rate pattern."
