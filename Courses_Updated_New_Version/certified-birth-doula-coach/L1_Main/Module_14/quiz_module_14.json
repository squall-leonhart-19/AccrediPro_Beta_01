            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "To maximize the transverse diameter of the pelvic outlet during the final stages of fetal descent (Station +2 to +4), which biomechanical adjustment is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "External rotation of the femurs (knees out, ankles in)",
                "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, ankles out)",
                "Deep squatting with a posterior pelvic tilt",
                "Maintaining a neutral standing position"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the femurs moves the sitz bones (ischial tuberosities) apart, effectively widening the pelvic outlet. While many instinctively 'knees out' (external rotation), this actually narrows the outlet and is better suited for the pelvic inlet."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client is experiencing 'back labor' and the provider notes the baby is in an Occiput Posterior (OP) position. Which technique is specifically designed to address the soft tissue tension that may be preventing fetal rotation?",
            "options": [
                "The Walcher’s Position",
                "The Side-Lying Release (SLR)",
                "Closed-knee squatting",
                "Supine reclining with a wedge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Side-Lying Release targets the pelvic floor muscles and the broad ligament, creating more 'room' in the mid-pelvis for the baby to rotate from OP to OA (Occiput Anterior)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Physiology of Stalled Labor,' a 2021 study highlighted that high levels of maternal catecholamines (adrenaline) can lead to which physiological outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increased sensitivity to Pitocin",
                "Rapid cervical dilation due to muscle tension",
                "Inhibition of oxytocin receptors and reduction in uterine perfusion",
                "Spontaneous rupture of membranes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High adrenaline triggers the 'fight or flight' response, which diverts blood away from the uterus to the extremities and inhibits the pulsatile release of oxytocin, often leading to a plateau in labor progress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "When navigating the 'Induction Cascade,' what is the primary mechanical benefit of using a Foley Bulb or Cook Balloon compared to pharmacological methods alone?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for an epidural",
                "It provides continuous fetal heart rate monitoring",
                "It causes immediate rupture of membranes",
                "It provides mechanical pressure to the cervix, stimulating endogenous prostaglandin release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Foley bulb acts as a mechanical dilator, mimicking the fetal head's pressure on the cervix, which triggers the body to release its own prostaglandins, often resulting in a 'riper' cervix before Pitocin is started."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A client is restricted to Continuous Electronic Fetal Monitoring (CEFM). Which advocacy strategy best supports 'High-Tech' physiological descent while maintaining safety protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Demanding the removal of all monitors against medical advice",
                "Requesting a telemetry (wireless) unit to allow for upright movement and hydrotherapy",
                "Remaining in a semi-recumbent position to ensure the signal is never lost",
                "Requesting an internal scalp electrode (FSE) immediately to bypass external belts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Telemetry allows the client to utilize biomechanical movement and gravity while still providing the continuous data the clinical team requires for high-risk or induced labors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "For a client with a dense epidural who is at 7cm and the baby is at -1 station, which position using a peanut ball is most likely to encourage internal rotation and descent?",
            "options": [
                "Semi-sitting with the ball between the ankles",
                "Side-lying with the top leg internally rotated (knee lower than the foot) over the ball",
                "Side-lying with the top leg externally rotated (knee higher than the foot) over the ball",
                "Supine with the ball under the knees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the femur (knee lower than the foot) opens the mid-pelvis and outlet, which is crucial for babies moving through the mid-stations (0 to +2)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "During Second Stage Mastery, research suggests that 'delayed pushing' (laboring down) for clients with an epidural results in:",
            "options": [
                "A significant increase in 4th-degree tears",
                "Higher rates of fetal distress due to prolonged labor",
                "A decrease in the duration of active pushing and a higher rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery",
                "An automatic requirement for a vacuum extraction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Laboring down allows the uterus to move the baby lower into the birth canal without maternal effort, preserving maternal energy and reducing the time spent in the 'active' pushing phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "When processing the 'Birth Narrative' in the postpartum period, what is the 'Gap' that doulas must help clients bridge to prevent birth trauma?",
            "options": [
                "The gap between the cost of the doula and the insurance reimbursement",
                "The gap between the client's 'Expected Birth' and their 'Actual Birth' experience",
                "The gap between the first and second stages of labor",
                "The gap between the hospital's policy and the provider's personal preference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma often resides in the discrepancy between expectation and reality. Helping a client integrate their actual experience into their self-narrative is key to emotional recovery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Asynclitism is defined as the fetal head being tilted toward one shoulder. What is the doula's primary goal when using 'Asymmetry' to correct this?",
            "options": [
                "To force the baby into the pelvis using gravity",
                "To create uneven space in the pelvis to encourage the head to level out",
                "To speed up contractions using nipple stimulation",
                "To ensure the client remains perfectly still for 30 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asymmetric positions (like the 'stair lunges' or 'captain morgan') change the angles of the pelvic planes, providing the baby with a different path to align their head correctly (synclitism)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "In the 'Induction Cascade,' why is Pitocin titration often more aggressive after an epidural is placed?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client can no longer feel the intensity of the contractions",
                "Because the epidural naturally speeds up labor",
                "Because Pitocin is required to maintain the epidural's effectiveness",
                "Because the hospital receives higher reimbursement for 'augmented' labors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Once the 'pain barrier' is removed by the epidural, providers often increase Pitocin more rapidly to achieve a 'textbook' contraction pattern, which may increase the risk of fetal tachysystole."
