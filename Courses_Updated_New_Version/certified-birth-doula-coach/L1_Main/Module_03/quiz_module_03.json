            "question": "In the biomechanics of the pelvic inlet, which movement pattern is most effective for increasing the transverse diameter to facilitate fetal engagement?",
            "options": [
                "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out)",
                "External rotation of the femurs (knees out, heels in)",
                "Deep squatting with a posterior pelvic tilt",
                "Posterior pelvic tucking in a standing position"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To open the pelvic inlet (the top of the pelvis), the femurs should be externally rotated. This movement spreads the iliac crests and increases the space available for the fetal head to engage."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to the 2017 Cochrane Review discussed in Lesson 2, upright positions during the first stage of labor compared to recumbent positions resulted in which of the following outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "An average reduction in labor duration by approximately 1 hour and 22 minutes",
                "A 50% increase in the need for oxytocin augmentation",
                "Higher rates of maternal exhaustion due to gravity resistance",
                "No significant difference in the duration of the first stage of labor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Cochrane Review (Lawrence et al., 2017) found that upright and mobile positions reduced the first stage of labor by about 1 hour and 22 minutes and decreased the likelihood of Cesarean section."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client in the latent phase of labor is feeling anxious to 'get things moving.' Based on the 'Conservation of Energy' principle in Lesson 3, what is the best doula recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage curb walking and stair climbing immediately to intensify contractions",
                "Suggest a 2-hour session of power lunges to ensure the head is well-engaged",
                "Recommend the 'Rest Until You Can't' approach, prioritizing sleep and hydration",
                "Advise the client to remain strictly in bed to prevent any cervical change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the latent phase, conservation of energy is critical. Doulas should encourage rest, nutrition, and hydration so the client has the stamina required for the active and transition phases."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "When the fetus is at a -2 station, which pelvic level is the doula attempting to influence, and what is the primary goal?",
            "options": [
                "The Mid-pelvis; the goal is to rotate the baby from OP to OA",
                "The Pelvic Outlet; the goal is to widen the intertuberous diameter",
                "The Pelvic Inlet; the goal is to facilitate engagement and descent",
                "The Perineal Floor; the goal is to soften the levator ani muscles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A -2 station indicates the baby is still above the ischial spines, meaning they are working through the pelvic inlet. Positioning should focus on opening the top of the pelvis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "To facilitate the 'Final Descent' at the pelvic outlet (Station +2 to +4), which femoral position maximizes the intertuberous diameter?",
            "options": [
                "External rotation (knees wide, feet together)",
                "Internal rotation (knees together, feet wide/heels out)",
                "Neutral alignment (knees and feet parallel)",
                "Asymmetrical lunging with the lead foot externally rotated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out) creates more space between the sitz bones (intertuberous diameter), which opens the pelvic outlet for the final stages of birth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client is experiencing 'back labor' and the provider notes the baby is in an Occiput Posterior (OP) position. Which technique is specifically designed to use abdominal displacement to help the baby rotate?",
            "options": [
                "The Walcher’s Position",
                "The Abdominal Lift and Tuck",
                "Strict Lithotomy",
                "Supine Reclining"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Abdominal Lift and Tuck helps lift the baby's weight off the mother's spine and uses the pelvic tilt to encourage the baby to rotate into an Occiput Anterior (OA) position."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, the 'Passive-Active' approach for epidural users highlights the use of a peanut ball. Research indicates that correct peanut ball use can reduce the second stage of labor by approximately how much time for nulliparous clients?",
            "options": [
                "15 minutes",
                "30 minutes",
                "Over 90 minutes",
                "The research showed no reduction in time, only increased comfort"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, such as those by Tussey et al. (2015), have shown that peanut ball use for clients with epidurals can significantly shorten the second stage of labor, sometimes by 90 minutes or more."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Which second-stage position is associated with the highest rate of perineal integrity (lowest rate of severe tears) according to clinical data?",
            "options": [
                "Deep Squatting",
                "Side-lying (Sims position)",
                "Lithotomy (on the back with legs in stirrups)",
                "Semi-Fowler’s with high vertical incline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Side-lying positions allow for a slower, more controlled crowning process and reduce the pressure on the perineum compared to squatting or lithotomy, leading to better perineal outcomes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "What is the primary characteristic of 'Asynclitism' in fetal positioning?",
            "options": [
                "The baby is breech (buttocks first)",
                "The baby's head is tilted toward one shoulder (cocked to the side)",
                "The baby's chin is extended rather than tucked",
                "The baby is in a complete transverse lie"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asynclitism occurs when the fetal head is tilted to the side, meaning the parietal bones are not entering the pelvis symmetrically. This often requires asymmetrical maternal positioning to resolve."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A client with an epidural has been at 10cm for two hours, but the baby remains at +1 station. The doula suggests using a peanut ball with the client's top leg rotated inward (knees together, ankle out). Why?",
            "options": [
                "To close the inlet and prevent the baby from floating back up",
                "To open the pelvic outlet and encourage the baby to descend past the ischial spines",
                "To encourage the client to take a nap before the pushing stage",
                "To prevent the epidural medication from pooling on one side"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Since the baby is at +1 station (moving toward the outlet), internal rotation of the femur (knees together, ankle out) is the correct biomechanical move to widen the outlet and facilitate descent."
