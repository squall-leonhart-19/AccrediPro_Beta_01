            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "A laboring client has been at 5cm for four hours with strong contractions, but the baby remains at -2 station. According to the 'Pelvic Levels' troubleshooting guide, where is the most likely restriction?",
            "options": ["The Pelvic Outlet", "The Mid-Pelvis", "The Pelvic Inlet", "The Soft Tissue/Cervix only"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A baby high at -2 or -3 station indicates a restriction at the Pelvic Inlet. Corrective positions should focus on opening the top of the pelvis, such as Walcher’s or Forward Leaning Inversion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "When using the CRADLE framework for an induced labor, what does a Bishop Score of 4 typically indicate to the birth team?",
            "options": ["The cervix is 'ripe' and ready for Pitocin alone", "The likelihood of a vaginal birth is very high without intervention", "Cervical ripening (mechanical or pharmacological) is likely necessary before active induction", "An immediate Cesarean is indicated due to lack of progress"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Bishop Score of 6 or less generally indicates that the cervix is 'unripe' and that ripening agents (like Cytotec or a Foley bulb) are necessary to increase the chances of a successful vaginal induction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "During a 'Family-Centered Cesarean,' which of the following is a primary advocacy point for a doula supporting a client in the OR?",
            "options": ["Requesting the surgical drape be kept high and opaque at all times", "Advocating for 'Vaginal Seeding' regardless of hospital policy", "Requesting the pulse oximeter be placed on the non-dominant hand to facilitate immediate skin-to-skin", "Insisting on performing the newborn's first weight check personally"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A key element of a family-centered Cesarean is facilitating immediate skin-to-skin contact; placing the pulse oximeter on the non-dominant hand or toes allows the mother to hold the baby more easily."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "According to ACOG guidelines discussed in Lesson 4, what is the approximate success rate for a Trial of Labor After Cesarean (TOLAC)?",
            "options": ["20-40%", "40-50%", "60-80%", "90-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ACOG data shows that 60-80% of women who attempt a TOLAC will achieve a successful vaginal birth (VBAC)."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client is experiencing intense 'back labor' and the provider notes the baby is in an OP (Occiput Posterior) position. Which corrective technique is most effective for encouraging fetal rotation?",
            "options": ["The Miles Circuit or Side-Lying Release", "Static supine reclining", "Closed-knee squatting", "Applying fundal pressure"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Miles Circuit and the Side-Lying Release are advanced doula techniques designed to create space in the pelvis and soften the pelvic floor, allowing the baby to rotate from OP to OA."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "When supporting a client with a 'High-Risk' diagnosis such as Preeclampsia, what is the doula's primary role regarding medical monitoring?",
            "options": ["Diagnosing blood pressure spikes before the nurse does", "Adjusting the IV pump if the flow rate seems too slow", "Monitoring for 'red flag' symptoms like visual changes or epigastric pain and alerting the staff", "Advising the client to refuse Magnesium Sulfate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-risk cases, the doula provides emotional support while remaining vigilant for clinical 'red flags' like headaches or blurred vision, ensuring the medical team is informed immediately."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, the 'Soft Advocacy' approach to conflict resolution suggests using which phrase when a provider suggests an intervention without explanation?",
            "options": ["'That is against the birth plan.'", "'Can you help us understand the medical necessity for this right now?'", "'We refuse that intervention.'", "'I need to speak to the hospital administrator.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soft advocacy focuses on curiosity and information gathering. Asking for 'medical necessity' prompts the provider to explain their reasoning, facilitating informed consent without creating immediate hostility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "What is the defining characteristic of 'Asynclitism' in a laboring fetus?",
            "options": ["The baby is feet-first (breech)", "The baby's head is tilted toward one shoulder rather than being tucked to the chest", "The baby is in a transverse lie", "The baby is too large for the pelvic outlet (CPD)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asynclitism occurs when the fetal head is tilted to the side (parietal presentation), which can cause labor to stall because the widest part of the head is trying to enter the pelvis."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Modern evidence-based practice (Zhang’s Curve) suggests that 'Active Labor' typically begins at how many centimeters of dilation?",
            "options": ["3 cm", "4 cm", "6 cm", "8 cm"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recent research and updated ACOG/SMFM guidelines define the start of active labor at 6cm, acknowledging that progress is often slower before this point without indicating a 'stall.'"

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing the CRADLE professional practice, what is the 'Golden Rule' for a doula navigating medical bias?",
            "options": ["Always agree with the provider to maintain harmony", "Speak for the client so they don't have to", "Model calm communication while centering the client's autonomy", "Leave the room if a conflict becomes uncomfortable"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional doula practice requires maintaining a collaborative environment while ensuring the client remains the primary decision-maker through calm, centered advocacy."
