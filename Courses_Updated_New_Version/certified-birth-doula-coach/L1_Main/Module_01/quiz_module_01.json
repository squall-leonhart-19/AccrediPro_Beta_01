            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Connection' phase is designed to build the foundation of the relationship. While logistics and history are important, the primary goal of the Discovery Call is establishing rapport and ensuring the doula and client are a good 'fit' for a therapeutic partnership."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In obstetric notation, G (Gravida) refers to the total number of pregnancies, and P (Para) refers to the number of births after 20 weeks. G2P0 means the client has been pregnant twice but has not yet reached a birth beyond 20 weeks."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Values-based sorting helps clients move beyond a simple birth plan to understand their core priorities, allowing the doula to support them effectively even if the birth plan needs to change due to medical necessity."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal is the upper boundary of the Window of Tolerance where the sympathetic nervous system takes over, leading to anxiety or agitation. Trauma-informed doulas must recognize this to help bring the client back to a regulated state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Gap Analysis allows the doula to identify exactly where the client needs the most support—whether it's education, advocacy tools, or emotional processing—to bridge the distance between their current state and their desired birth experience."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validation and an invitation to identify safety needs are hallmarks of trauma-informed care. It acknowledges the client's lived experience without being dismissive or overly clinical."
