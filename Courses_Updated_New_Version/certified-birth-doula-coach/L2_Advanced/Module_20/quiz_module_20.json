            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "When conducting a Psychosocial Risk Screening (L1), which validated tool is specifically used to identify symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder that may impact the prenatal experience?",
            "options": ["EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale)", "GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7)", "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)", "ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) Score"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the EPDS is for depression/anxiety broadly, the GAD-7 is the gold standard for specifically screening for generalized anxiety symptoms during the prenatal and postpartum periods."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In Advanced Birth Value Mapping (L2), a client who ranks 'Autonomy' as their primary value is most likely to experience birth trauma if which of the following occurs?",
            "options": ["A medically necessary cesarean section is performed with full consent", "The labor lasts longer than 24 hours", "Interventions are performed without clear explanation or choice", "The hospital environment is louder than expected"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For clients who prioritize autonomy, the loss of agency and lack of informed consent are higher predictors of birth trauma than the medical interventions themselves."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A Biomechanical Assessment (L3) reveals a client has an Anthropoid pelvis. Which fetal position is statistically more common in this pelvic type due to its deep anterior-posterior diameter?",
            "options": ["Occiput Anterior (OA)", "Occiput Posterior (OP)", "Right Occiput Transverse (ROT)", "Left Occiput Transverse (LOT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Anthropoid pelvis is oval-shaped with a long anterior-posterior diameter, which often accommodates the fetus in an Occiput Posterior (OP) position more easily than other pelvic types."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "During a Sensory Processing Profile assessment (L4), a client is identified as a 'Sensory Avoider.' Which doula intervention is most likely to be effective during active labor?",
            "options": ["Using strong aromatherapy scents like peppermint for nausea", "Providing constant firm counter-pressure and touch", "Minimizing room traffic and lowering the volume of monitors", "Encouraging the use of a loud, upbeat labor playlist"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory avoiders have a low neurological threshold and can become easily overwhelmed by environmental stimuli; reducing noise and light helps them maintain focus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which Health Literacy assessment technique (L5) is most effective for a doula to ensure a client understands the risks and benefits of an induction of labor?",
            "options": ["Providing a 10-page evidence-based pamphlet", "The 'Teach-Back' method", "Asking 'Do you have any questions?'", "Using medical terminology to ensure accuracy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Teach-Back' method requires the client to explain the information in their own words, which confirms comprehension far more effectively than binary (yes/no) questions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "When assessing Clinical Environment & Hospital Culture (L6), a 'Tier 1' interventionist hospital is typically characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": ["A primary cesarean rate below 15%", "Routine use of intermittent auscultation for low-risk clients", "High rates of elective inductions and continuous EFM as standard policy", "Universal access to labor tubs and nitrous oxide"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tier 1 or highly medicalized cultures often prioritize standardized protocols, such as continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) and elective inductions, over individualized, low-intervention care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "During a Fetal Position Screening (L7) using Leopold's Maneuvers, the doula feels a hard, round, non-ballottable mass in the lower uterine segment. What does this indicate?",
            "options": ["The fetus is in a breech presentation", "The fetus is in a cephalic (head-down) presentation", "The fetus is in a transverse lie", "The placenta is low-lying"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Leopold's maneuvers, a hard, round mass at the pelvic inlet that moves with the body (non-ballottable) usually indicates the fetal breech (buttocks), whereas the head is ballottable (moves independently of the trunk)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "The City Birth Trauma Scale (L8) is used in postpartum assessment to distinguish between 'Baby Blues' and which of the following?",
            "options": ["Postpartum Psychosis", "Lactation Failure", "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) related to childbirth", "Iron-deficiency anemia"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The City Birth Trauma Scale is a specific psychometric tool designed to measure the symptoms of PTSD following childbirth, according to DSM-5 criteria."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "If a client's labor stalls at a +1 station (mid-pelvis), which biomechanical movement (L3) should the doula suggest to help the fetus descend?",
            "options": ["Deep squats to open the pelvic outlet", "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out)", "External rotation of the femurs (knees out, heels in)", "Sitting upright on a birth ball"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in) helps open the mid-pelvis and pelvic outlet, whereas external rotation (knees out) opens the pelvic inlet."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client with a 'Collaborative' Decision-Making Style (L5) is most likely to respond well to which doula approach?",
            "options": ["The doula making all decisions for the client", "The client ignoring all medical advice", "Facilitating a dialogue between the client and the OB/GYN to weigh options together", "The doula providing only peer-reviewed studies without discussion"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collaborative decision-makers value the expertise of their care team but want to be active participants in the final choice, making facilitated dialogue the most effective support tool."
