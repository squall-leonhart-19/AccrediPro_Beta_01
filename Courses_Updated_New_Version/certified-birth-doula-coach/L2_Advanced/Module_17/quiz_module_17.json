            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client who is a survivor of sexual abuse begins to dissociate during an unexpectedly intense transition phase. What is the most appropriate trauma-informed response for a doula?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the intensity of physical touch to 'ground' the client back into their body.",
                "Use a low, calm voice to name objects in the room (grounding exercises) and ask for permission before any physical contact.",
                "Immediately call for the anesthesiologist to suggest an epidural to stop the physical sensations.",
                "Leave the room to give the client privacy until the dissociation passes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care emphasizes safety and choice. Dissociation is a coping mechanism; grounding techniques (like naming objects) and strictly maintaining physical boundaries by asking permission help re-establish a sense of safety."

        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "For a client on strict hospital bed rest due to Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM), what is a key psychological challenge the doula should address?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Disenfranchised Grief' of not having a 'normal' third trimester.",
                "The physical atrophy of the abdominal muscles.",
                "The need for high-intensity aerobic exercise.",
                "The requirement to avoid all forms of digital communication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clients on long-term bed rest often experience a form of disenfranchised grief or 'stolen time,' where the loss of their expected pregnancy experience leads to significant emotional distress and anxiety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In a twin birth scenario, why do many hospitals require the vaginal delivery to occur in an Operating Room (OR)?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the mother cannot move during the delivery of Twin A.",
                "Because twin births are automatically considered surgical procedures by law.",
                "To allow for an immediate 'emergency' Cesarean transition if Twin B experiences cord prolapse or malpresentation after Twin A is born.",
                "To keep the babies' temperatures regulated in a colder environment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While Twin A often delivers without issue, Twin B faces higher risks of malpresentation (turning breech or transverse) or cord accidents once space opens up in the uterus, necessitating the proximity to surgical equipment."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "When supporting a client with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) in recovery, what is the doula's primary role regarding Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the infant's withdrawal symptoms before the nursing staff.",
                "To encourage the parent to hide their history from the pediatricians to avoid social services.",
                "To support 'Eat, Sleep, Console' (ESC) models, encouraging skin-to-skin and parental presence which can reduce the need for pharmacological intervention.",
                "To provide medical advice on tapering the client's Methadone or Buprenorphine dosage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Eat, Sleep, Console' method is a trauma-informed, evidence-based approach that prioritizes the parent's role in soothing the infant, which has been shown to reduce NICU stays and medication needs for the baby."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In the event of a stillbirth, which action is considered a 'Gold Standard' for bereavement doula support?",

                "Avoiding the use of the baby's name to prevent further emotional attachment.",
                "Offering to help create 'tangible memories,' such as photos, hair clippings, or handprints, even if the parents are initially hesitant.",
                "Telling the parents 'everything happens for a reason' to provide spiritual comfort."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creating tangible memories is a vital part of the mourning process. Many parents regret not having these items later; a doula gently offers these options while respecting the parents' ultimate choice."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A transgender man (gestational parent) expresses concern about 'chestfeeding' in the hospital. How should the doula best advocate for him?",
            "options": [

                "Model the client's preferred language (e.g., 'chestfeeding,' 'parental milk') and ensure his pronouns are correctly noted on the birth plan and room signage.",
                "Tell the client that the medical terminology is more important for the baby's health records.",
                "Advise the client to use formula to avoid the gender dysphoria associated with lactation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inclusive advocacy involves modeling the client's language and ensuring the environment (signage, charts) reflects their identity to reduce gender dysphoria and improve the care experience."

            "id": "q17_7",

            "options": [
                "Standard of Care",
                "Obstetric Violence",
                "Implicit Bias",
                "Active Management of Labor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Obstetric violence includes any act of non-consented procedures, physical abuse, or humiliation during the birthing process. An episiotomy performed without explicit, informed consent is a clear example."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "What is a defining characteristic of 'Prodromal Labor' that distinguishes it from 'Active Labor'?",

                "The immediate rupture of membranes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prodromal labor (often called 'start-stop' labor) involves contractions that feel like 'the real thing' but fail to dilate the cervix progressively, leading to significant maternal exhaustion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client is 41 weeks pregnant and their provider is insisting on an induction tonight, citing only 'the due date.' The client wants to wait. What is the doula's role in this 'Informed Refusal' scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client they must follow the doctor's orders to ensure a safe baby.",
                "Encourage the client to use the BRAIN acronym to ask about the risks of waiting versus the risks of induction.",
                "Argue with the doctor directly about the latest ACOG guidelines.",
                "Advise the client to leave the hospital and have a home birth instead."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is to facilitate communication. Using the BRAIN acronym (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Next steps/Nothing) helps the client gather the information needed to make an informed refusal or consent."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "According to research on the 'Slow' labor (Failure to Progress), what is one of the most effective non-pharmacological interventions a doula can suggest to help a baby rotate?",

                "Strict bed rest to save energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Miles Circuit and other optimal fetal positioning (OFP) techniques like forward-leaning inversions help create space in the pelvis for the baby to rotate from a posterior to an anterior position, often resolving 'failure to progress' issues."
