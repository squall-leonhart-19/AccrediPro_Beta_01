            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) sit at the top of the evidence pyramid because they synthesize data from multiple high-quality studies to minimize bias."

            "options": [
                "Have a spontaneous vaginal birth",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The review found that continuous support increased the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth and decreased the likelihood of Cesarean sections and the use of pain medications."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In L3, the 'Research-Practice Gap' in modern obstetrics is discussed. On average, how long does it take for high-quality clinical research to be integrated into routine medical practice?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, such as those by Balas & Boren, suggest it takes an average of 17 years for only 14% of original research to the benefit of patient care, highlighting a significant lag in evidence-based practice."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The original risk was 2%. A 50% reduction of a 2% risk results in a 1% risk. The Absolute Risk Reduction is the difference: 2% - 1% = 1%."

                "It had no impact on the use of epidurals or Pitocin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ARRIVE trial found that elective induction at 39 weeks led to a lower rate of Cesarean sections (18.6% vs 22.2%) specifically within the strict parameters of the study protocol."

            "id": "q19_6",

            "options": [
                "The study only included women over the age of 40.",
                "The trial was conducted in community birth centers rather than hospitals.",
                "The low C-section rate in the induction group may not be replicable in hospitals that do not follow the trial's strict labor management protocols.",
                "The trial found that induction was more expensive for the families."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The trial used a strict protocol for defining 'active labor' and 'labor arrest.' In many community hospitals without these strict definitions, induction often leads to higher C-section rates than those seen in the trial."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "NNT helps translate risk into a practical figure; for example, if the NNT for continuous support to prevent one C-section is 25, it means 25 women need a doula for one C-section to be avoided."

                "A client chooses a home birth.",
                "One intervention (like an induction or epidural) creates a new problem that requires further medical interventions to manage.",

                "The baby is born en caul."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The cascade refers to the process where one medical intervention leads to the need for another, such as Pitocin leading to stronger contractions, which leads to an epidural, which may lead to decreased mobility and further interventions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autonomy is the ethical requirement to respect a patient's right to self-determination, ensuring they are the primary decision-maker in their care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By providing evidence and then using open-ended questions, the Doula Coach empowers the client to make their own decision without overstepping into medical advice."
