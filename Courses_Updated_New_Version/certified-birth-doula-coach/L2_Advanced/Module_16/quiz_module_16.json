            "question": "In the CRADLE framework for high-risk inductions, what does the 'L' represent, and what is its primary focus for the doula?",
            "options": [
                "Labor Support; focusing on physical comfort measures like massage.",
                "Logistics; managing the environment, partner needs, and external communications.",
                "Legal Advocacy; ensuring the hospital follows the birth plan strictly.",
                "Lactation Preparation; starting breastfeeding education early due to high risk."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the CRADLE framework, 'L' stands for Logistics. This involves the doula taking over the management of the 'outer circle'—ensuring the partner is fed, the room is organized, and communication with family is handled—so the birthing person can focus on the high-stress medical situation."

            "question": "A client is experiencing 'back labor' and the provider confirms the baby is in the Occiput Posterior (OP) position. Which sequence of movements is specifically designed to help rotate an OP baby?",
            "options": [
                "The Walcher's Position for 30 minutes followed by flat supine rest.",
                "Immediate epidural administration to relax the pelvic floor.",
                "The Miles Circuit (Open Knee-Chest, Exaggerated Side-Lying, and Curb Walking/Movement).",
                "Strict bed rest to allow gravity to pull the baby's back down."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Miles Circuit is a renowned three-step positioning sequence used to help rotate a baby from OP to OA (Occiput Anterior) by creating space in the different levels of the pelvis."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "When supporting a survivor of sexual abuse, why might a client become 'unnaturally still' or 'extremely compliant' during a medical procedure?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates they are finally relaxed and trusting the medical team.",
                "It is a sign that the epidural is working effectively.",
                "It may be a 'freeze' response or dissociation used as a coping mechanism for trauma.",
                "It shows the client has moved into the 'Transition' phase of labor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma survivors may exhibit 'quiet compliance' or dissociation (freezing) when they feel their bodily autonomy is threatened. A trauma-informed doula recognizes this as a potential trigger response rather than true relaxation."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "According to ACOG data often cited in VBAC counseling, what is the approximate risk of uterine rupture for a person with one prior low-transverse cesarean section during a Trial of Labor (TOLAC)?",
            "options": [
                "5% to 7%",
                "0.5% to 0.9%",
                "10% to 12%",
                "0.01% to 0.05%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The risk of uterine rupture for a standard TOLAC with one prior low-transverse incision is low, typically cited between 0.5% and 0.9% (approximately 1 in 100 to 1 in 200)."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "During a precipitous labor (labor lasting <3 hours), the doula arrives at the home and finds the baby's head is crowning. What is the most appropriate immediate action for the doula?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to push as hard as possible to finish the birth quickly.",
                "Attempt to push the baby's head back in until EMS arrives.",
                "Guide the client to pant or blow short breaths to slow the crowning and minimize tearing.",
                "Perform a sterile cervical exam to check for a cord."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a precipitous birth, the goal is to control the speed of the emergence to prevent perineal trauma and manage the 'shock' of the rapid delivery. Panting or blowing helps prevent forceful involuntary pushing during crowning."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "The 'Intervention Cascade' often begins with an elective induction. Which sequence best describes a common progression of this cascade?",
            "options": [
                "Induction -> Pitocin -> Increased Pain -> Epidural -> Restricted Movement -> Assisted Delivery.",
                "Epidural -> Natural Rupture of Membranes -> Walking -> Spontaneous Birth.",
                "Pitocin -> Decreased Pain -> Movement -> Water Birth.",
                "Induction -> Reduced Monitoring -> Increased Mobility -> Cesarean."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Intervention Cascade describes how one medical intervention (like Pitocin for induction) often leads to the need for another (like an epidural for the increased pain), which then restricts movement and may lead to instrumental or surgical delivery."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In a twin pregnancy, which scenario is generally considered the most 'favorable' for a planned vaginal delivery?",
            "options": [
                "Twin A is Breech and Twin B is Vertex.",
                "Twin A is Vertex and Twin B is Vertex or Breech.",
                "Both twins are in a Transverse Lie.",
                "Twin A is Footling Breech and Twin B is Vertex."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As long as 'Twin A' (the baby lowest in the pelvis) is Vertex (head down), many providers are comfortable attempting a vaginal delivery, even if 'Twin B' is breech, as the birth canal has already been dilated by the first twin."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When providing bereavement support for a family experiencing a stillbirth, what is the 'Golden Rule' of doula communication mentioned in the module?",
            "options": [
                "Avoid using the baby's name to prevent further emotional pain.",
                "Use 'at least' statements (e.g., 'At least you know you can get pregnant').",
                "Follow the parents' lead, use the baby's name if they do, and offer to create tangible memories.",
                "Focus exclusively on the medical reasons for the loss to provide closure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bereavement support emphasizes validating the loss, using the baby's name to acknowledge their personhood, and facilitating memory-making (photos, handprints) which are vital for the grieving process."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client's labor has slowed significantly (Stalled Progress) at 7cm. The provider suggests an amniotomy (breaking the water). Using the BRAIN tool, the doula helps the client ask about 'Alternatives.' What is a valid physiological alternative to explore first?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate Cesarean section to avoid infection.",
                "Position changes, hydration, and a 'rest and be thankful' period.",
                "Increasing the epidural dosage to numb the stalled sensation.",
                "Starting Pitocin immediately without breaking the water."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before moving to more invasive interventions like an amniotomy, physiological alternatives such as changing positions (to fix a potential malposition), ensuring the client is hydrated/nourished, or allowing a period of rest can often restart stalled labor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "What is the primary risk associated with a 'Footling Breech' presentation compared to a 'Frank Breech'?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of the baby having hip dysplasia later in life.",
                "Higher likelihood of the baby being 'sunny-side up'.",
                "Increased risk of umbilical cord prolapse because the feet do not 'plug' the cervix effectively.",
                "There is no difference in risk between the two types of breech."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a footling breech, the feet or a single foot presents first. Because the feet do not fill the lower uterine segment as effectively as the buttocks (Frank breech) or head (Vertex), there is a significantly higher risk of the umbilical cord slipping past the presenting part (prolapse)."
