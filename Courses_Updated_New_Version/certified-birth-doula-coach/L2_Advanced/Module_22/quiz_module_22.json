            "question": "A client asks you if they should agree to a Pitocin induction recommended by their OB-GYN. According to the Advanced Scope of Practice, what is the most ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Advise them against it if they originally wanted a natural birth.",
                "Tell them it is a safe procedure and they should trust their doctor.",
                "Facilitate a discussion using the BRAIN acronym to help them evaluate the clinical recommendation.",
                "Provide a list of natural alternatives and tell them to refuse the induction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas do not give medical advice or make decisions for clients; instead, they provide tools like BRAIN (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Nothing) to support the client's own decision-making process."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios best describes 'coercion' rather than informed consent in a birth setting?",
            "options": [
                "A nurse explaining the risks of a procedure clearly.",
                "A provider telling a client, 'I won't be responsible for what happens to your baby if you don't do this,' to secure compliance.",
                "A doula suggesting the client try a different labor position.",
                "A doctor asking for a signature on a consent form after a full discussion of options."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coercion involves using fear, threats, or manipulation to gain compliance, which violates the ethical principle of bodily autonomy and informed refusal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Cultural Competence' and 'Cultural Humility' in doula care?",
            "options": [
                "Competence is for medical staff; humility is for doulas.",
                "Humility is a lifelong process of self-reflection and addressing power imbalances, while competence implies a 'finished' state of knowledge.",
                "Competence focuses on race, while humility focuses on religion.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are interchangeable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility recognizes that one can never be fully 'competent' in another's culture and requires ongoing self-critique and the balancing of power dynamics."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "While walking the 'Advocacy Tightrope,' a doula realizes their personal bias against epidurals is influencing the client's decision. What is the ethical mandate in this situation?",
            "options": [
                "Continue advocating against the epidural because it aligns with the original birth plan.",
                "Remain silent and let the medical staff take over completely.",
                "Check their bias and pivot back to supporting the client’s current autonomy, even if it contradicts the initial plan.",
                "Tell the client they are making a mistake based on the doula's experience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is to support the client's autonomy, not to project their own values or preferences onto the client's birth experience."

            "options": [
                "Accept the fee but don't tell the client to keep things simple.",
                "Accept the fee only if the photographer is high-quality.",
                "Decline the fee or disclose it fully to the client, as undisclosed kickbacks create a conflict of interest.",
                "Ask for a $100 fee instead to cover administrative costs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional integrity requires transparency. Undisclosed referral fees (kickbacks) can bias recommendations and undermine the client's trust."

            "id": "q22_6",

            "options": [
                "Immediately, as long as the client's face isn't visible.",
                "Only after obtaining specific, written consent from the client for that specific use.",
                "If the client previously signed a general contract that mentioned 'marketing'.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital ethics and privacy require explicit, informed consent for sharing any client-related content, regardless of whether names or faces are shown."

            "options": [
                "Intervene and tell the doctor they are being too rough.",
                "Document the event for a potential lawsuit.",
                "Maintain a calm presence, hold the client's hand, and stay out of the physical way of the medical team.",
                "Leave the room to give the medical team more space."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In an emergency, the doula must stay within scope by providing emotional support and maintaining the 'calm in the room' without interfering with life-saving medical maneuvers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Why is self-care considered an 'ethical mandate' for birth doulas rather than just a personal choice?",
            "options": [
                "Because doulas deserve to be happy.",
                "Because burnout and compassion fatigue can lead to poor judgment, boundary crossing, and inadequate client support.",
                "Because it is required by the IRS for business deductions.",
                "Because clients prefer doulas who look well-rested."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An impaired doula (due to burnout or vicarious trauma) cannot provide safe, ethical care. Self-care ensures the doula remains competent and present for their clients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client from a marginalized community expresses fear of systemic bias in the hospital. How does the ethical principle of 'Equity' guide the doula's response?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client that all patients are treated the same in modern hospitals.",
                "Acknowledge the validity of their concern and provide extra advocacy support to ensure their voice is heard.",
                "Suggest the client change hospitals immediately.",
                "Ignore the comment to avoid making the medical staff defensive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Equity involves recognizing that different clients face different levels of risk and systemic barriers, and providing the necessary support to bridge those gaps."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Professional Integrity, what should a doula do if they witness a clear violation of a client's rights by a medical provider?",
            "options": [
                "Physically block the provider from touching the client.",
                "Yell at the provider to stop immediately.",
                "Wait until after the birth to say anything.",
                "Encourage the client to ask for a pause (if safe) and use their voice, while documenting the incident objectively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The doula supports the client in using their own voice ('clinical pause') and provides objective documentation, which preserves the doula's role as a non-medical support person while protecting the client's rights."
