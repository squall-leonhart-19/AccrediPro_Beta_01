            "question": "A client's baby is currently at a -2 station, and labor has stalled. Based on advanced pelvic biomechanics, which area of the pelvis should the doula focus on opening?",
            "options": [
                "The pelvic inlet (top)",
                "The mid-pelvis (ischial spines)",
                "The pelvic outlet (bottom)",
                "The pubic symphysis only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "At a -2 station, the fetal head is still above the pelvic brim. Techniques like Walcher's or deep squats with external hip rotation are used to open the pelvic inlet to allow the head to engage."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "When utilizing the Rebozo 'Sifting' (Mantezo) technique during the first stage of labor, what is the primary physiological goal?",
            "options": [
                "To manually turn the baby from OP to OA",
                "To relax the abdominal muscles and uterine ligaments to facilitate fetal positioning",
                "To induce contractions by stimulating the cervix",
                "To provide counter-pressure to the sacrum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rebozo sifting is not a manual rotation; instead, it uses gentle vibration to relax the broad and round ligaments, allowing the baby to find the most optimal position for descent."

        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A client is diagnosed with an asynclitic fetal presentation (head tilted to one side). Which position is most effective for helping the fetal head level out?",
            "options": [
                "Semi-sitting in bed",
                "Symmetric squatting",
                "Exaggerated Side-Lying (Sims) on the side the baby is leaning toward",
                "Hands and knees with a flat back"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exaggerated side-lying (Sims) or the Side-Lying Release uses gravity and pelvic shifting to help an asynclitic head realign with the birth canal."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "To open the pelvic outlet for a client with an epidural who is in the pushing stage, how should the peanut ball be positioned?",
            "options": [
                "Between the thighs with knees and ankles parallel",
                "High between the thighs with knees wider than the ankles",
                "Between the calves with knees together and ankles rolled outward",
                "Under the small of the back to create an arch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, ankles out) opens the pelvic outlet, which is the narrowest part of the pelvis during the second stage of labor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "According to the Gate Control Theory of Pain, why is TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) effective during labor?",
            "options": [
                "It numbs the local nerves in the lower back entirely",
                "It stimulates large-diameter nerve fibers to 'close the gate' to slower pain signals",
                "It increases the production of synthetic oxytocin",
                "It lowers the client's heart rate through biofeedback"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TENS stimulates the sensory nerves that travel faster than pain nerves, essentially 'crowding out' or blocking the pain signals from reaching the brain."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "During a Pitocin-induced labor, a doula notices the client is experiencing 'tachysystole.' What is the most appropriate high-level advocacy step?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the nurse to turn off the Pitocin immediately",
                "Manually adjust the IV pump to a lower setting",
                "Suggest the client ask the provider: 'Can we pause the titration or lower the dose to allow the baby a recovery period?'",
                "Advise the client that tachysystole is a normal part of induction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas do not give clinical orders or touch medical equipment. High-level advocacy involves facilitating a conversation between the client and the medical team regarding the safety of the contraction pattern."

        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "In conflict transformation with medical staff, the 'CUS' model stands for:",
            "options": [
                "Calm, Understanding, Support",
                "Concerned, Uncomfortable, Safety Issue",
                "Caring, Urgent, Systematic",
                "Communicate, Underline, Solve"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CUS is a standard communication tool in healthcare: 'I am Concerned, I am Uncomfortable, this is a Safety issue.' It signals to the medical team that a critical pause is needed."

        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "When supporting a client with a history of previous birth trauma, which 'trauma-informed' action is most critical during a cervical exam?",
            "options": [
                "Leaving the room to give the client privacy",
                "Holding the client's hand even if they haven't asked",
                "Ensuring the provider asks for verbal consent and explains the steps before touching the client",
                "Telling the client 'this will be over quickly' to minimize anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care prioritizes autonomy and predictability. Ensuring the provider obtains clear consent and uses 'predictive guidance' helps the client feel safe and in control."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A baby is stuck at the mid-pelvis (0 station) in an Occiput Posterior (OP) position. Which technique is most likely to increase the transverse diameter of the mid-pelvis?",
            "options": [
                "Closed-knee pushing",
                "Asymmetrical movements like lunges or stair climbing",
                "Lying flat on the back with legs in stirrups",
                "Hyperflexion of the hips (McRoberts maneuver)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asymmetrical positions (lunges, side-lying with one leg up) shift the pelvic bones and can increase the space in the mid-pelvis to facilitate fetal rotation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "A client with an epidural begins to experience intense shivering (post-epidural shaking). What should the doula explain to the client?",
            "options": [
                "It is a sign that the epidural is wearing off and needs a bolus",
                "It is a common physiological response to the anesthetic and temperature regulation changes, not a sign of being cold",
                "It indicates an immediate allergic reaction to the medication",
                "It is a sign that the second stage of labor (pushing) has begun"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epidural-induced shivering occurs in up to 30-50% of patients due to the medication's effect on thermoregulation and the redistribution of body heat. It is benign but can be distressing if not explained."
