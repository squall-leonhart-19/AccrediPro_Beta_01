            "question": "During the Advanced Clinical Intake (L1), a client presents with a BMI of 36, a history of well-controlled gestational diabetes (GDM), and a previous 3rd-degree tear. How is this client categorized in the Risk Stratification framework?",
            "options": [
                "Tier 1: Low Risk / Standard Doula Care",
                "Tier 2: Moderate Risk / Enhanced Monitoring",
                "Tier 3: High Risk / Specialist Collaborative Care",
                "Tier 4: Emergent / Immediate Transfer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tier 2 (Moderate Risk) includes clients with managed metabolic conditions (GDM) and significant past obstetric trauma (3rd-degree tear) that require specific modifications to the treatment plan without necessitating high-risk specialist management."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When designing an Evidence-Based Educational Pathway (L2), which principle is most effective for ensuring a client retains biomechanical positioning techniques for labor?",

                "Passive observation of birth videos",
                "Single-session intensive lecture at 38 weeks",
                "Spaced repetition with active physical rehearsal throughout the third trimester",
                "Providing a 50-page manual for independent study"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adult learning science and the Pathway model emphasize spaced repetition and kinesthetic (active) rehearsal to ensure motor patterns are accessible during the stress of active labor."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "In Biomechanical Mapping (L3), if a fetus is confirmed to be in an 'Occiput Posterior' (OP) position at the +1 station, which pelvic level should the Proactive Positioning Plan target?",

                "The Abdominal Wall for external version"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The +1 station indicates the fetus is in the mid-pelvis. Positioning plans at this stage focus on pelvic mobility and 'opening' the mid-pelvis to facilitate the 135-degree rotation required for an OP fetus to turn to OA."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "Which intervention is a primary component of a Sensory Modulation Protocol (L4) for a client with high tactile sensitivity (hyper-responsiveness)?",

                "Continuous bright lighting for safety",
                "High-volume rhythmic music"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients with tactile hyper-responsiveness, light touch can be irritating or over-stimulating. Deep pressure (proprioceptive input) provides grounding and helps modulate the nervous system's response to pain."

                "To tell the provider what the client's birth plan says"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Clarify' step is designed to facilitate informed consent by ensuring the client has all the information (BRAIN: Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Nothing) before making a decision."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional safeguards are proactive tools, such as 'safe words' or 'pause signals,' that allow a survivor of trauma to maintain control and agency during clinical exams or interventions."

                "Leaving the room to stay out of the way of the medical team"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-intensity emergencies, the doula's role shifts to maintaining the emotional container and continuity of support, helping the client stay regulated while the medical team manages the clinical emergency."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "The 'Master CRADLE™ Treatment Plan Synthesis' (L8) combines six domains. What does the 'D' in CRADLE™ stand for in the context of trauma-informed care?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research into biomechanical protocols suggests a significant reduction in dystocia-related cesareans, typically ranging from 28% to 35% when positions are used proactively rather than reactively."
