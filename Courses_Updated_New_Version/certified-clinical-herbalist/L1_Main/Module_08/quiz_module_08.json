            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "In the context of the HPA Axis (Lesson 1), what phenomenon occurs when chronic stress causes glucocorticoid receptors to become less sensitive, leading to a failure of the negative feedback loop?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucocorticoid resistance occurs when tissues (including the brain) become less responsive to cortisol, preventing the negative feedback loop from 'shutting off' the stress response, leading to chronic systemic inflammation."
