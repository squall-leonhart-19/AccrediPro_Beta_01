            "question": "Which herbal action is specifically indicated for the 'Heat/Excitation' tissue state, characterized by redness, rapid pulse, and hyper-functioning tissues?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulants",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the tissue state model, Heat/Excitation requires cooling and calming influences. Refrigerants reduce heat, while Sedatives calm the over-active 'excited' state of the tissues."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tropism refers to the specific affinity an herb has for a particular organ system (e.g., Crataegus for the heart or Ceanothus for the spleen)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Atrophy implies dryness and lack of lubrication; therefore, a Demulcent (moistening) herb with a Respiratory tropism (like Althaea or Verbascum) is the correct match."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CYP450 enzymes are responsible for metabolizing most pharmaceuticals; herbs that induce or inhibit these enzymes (like St. John's Wort) can cause dangerous fluctuations in drug levels."
