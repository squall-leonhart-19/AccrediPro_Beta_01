            "question": "In the context of Herbal Energetics (Lesson 1), a client presenting with 'Adrenal Exhaustion' characterized by low blood pressure, thin pulse, and chronic fatigue would most likely be classified under which energetic state?",
            "options": [
                "Heat/Excitation",
                "Damp/Stagnation",
                "Cold/Depression (Atrophy)",
                "Dry/Tension"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cold/Depression or Atrophy represents a lack of vital fire and metabolic activity, common in late-stage HPA axis dysfunction where the 'Vital Spark' is diminished."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, which adaptogen is most appropriate for a 'tired but wired' client with an elevated Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and evening anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "Panax ginseng (Asian Ginseng)",

                "Rhodiola rosea (Rosavin-heavy extract)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is a 'calming' adaptogen (nervine/sedative qualities) that helps modulate high cortisol levels, whereas Panax and Rhodiola can be too stimulating for 'wired' individuals."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A 2018 double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Sharma et al.) referenced in Lesson 3 found that 600mg of Ashwagandha daily for 8 weeks resulted in which thyroid outcome?",

                "Direct neutralization of circulating glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine is a potent AMPK activator, which improves insulin sensitivity, increases glucose uptake in muscles, and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitex acts as a dopamine agonist at the pituitary, which reduces prolactin. Lower prolactin allows for better corpus luteum function and increased progesterone production."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "For male reproductive health (Lesson 6), why is Urtica dioica (Nettle) root specifically used to support testosterone levels in aging men?",
            "options": [
                "It converts estrogen directly into testosterone",
                "It binds to Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), increasing free testosterone",
                "It acts as a direct precursor to DHEA",
                "It stimulates the Leydig cells via LH mimicry"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nettle root contains lignans that bind to SHBG, preventing SHBG from binding to testosterone, thereby increasing the 'free' or bioavailable fraction of the hormone."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on Herb-Drug Interactions, why should Lycopus virginicus (Bugleweed) be avoided in patients taking Levothyroxine (Synthroid)?",
            "options": [
                "It causes Levothyroxine to reach toxic levels in the blood",
                "It may antagonize TSH and inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, counteracting the medication",
                "It increases the rate of Levothyroxine excretion through the kidneys",
                "It prevents the conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bugleweed has thyrosuppressive effects; using it alongside thyroid replacement therapy can lead to unpredictable hormone levels and reduced drug efficacy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Iodine (from Fucus) and Selenium are essential cofactors for thyroid hormone synthesis and the conversion of T4 to T3, making them foundational for subclinical support."
