            "options": [
                "The Chief Complaint is what the client wants to fix; the Root Cause is the underlying physiological or energetic imbalance.",
                "The Chief Complaint is always physical, while the Root Cause is always emotional.",
                "There is no distinction; they are used interchangeably in clinical herbalism.",
                "The Chief Complaint is determined by the herbalist, while the Root Cause is determined by the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Chief Complaint is the primary reason the client sought care (the symptom), whereas the Root Cause is the underlying driver or energetic pattern producing that symptom."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Objective (O) section contains measurable, observable data collected by the practitioner, including physical exams, tongue assessment, and pulse reading."

            "question": "During L3: Medical History & Medication Reconciliation, why is it critical to identify if a client is taking St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) alongside pharmaceutical drugs?",
            "options": [
                "It causes immediate toxicity in all combinations.",
                "It is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme, which can significantly lower the blood concentration of many medications.",
                "It inhibits the kidneys from excreting water-soluble drugs.",
                "It increases the sedative effects of all over-the-counter antihistamines."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is a well-documented inducer of the Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, which can lead to the rapid metabolism and decreased efficacy of various drugs, including oral contraceptives and anticoagulants."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These details identify what makes the symptom worse (cold/damp) and what makes it better (heat), which are key components of the 'OLD CARTS' mnemonic for symptom assessment."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In L5: Nutritional Assessment, a client reports stools that are 'separate hard lumps, like nuts' (Type 1 on the Bristol Stool Scale). This most likely indicates which energetic tissue state?",

                "Melatonin production has no impact on other hormones.",
                "Disrupted sleep can lead to dysregulated cortisol rhythms, affecting the entire endocrine axis.",
                "Sleep is only relevant if the client's chief complaint is insomnia.",
                "Circadian rhythms only affect digestive enzymes, not hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HPA axis is deeply influenced by light-dark cycles; chronic sleep disruption leads to cortisol imbalances that can cascade into thyroid and reproductive hormone issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ROS is a comprehensive head-to-toe inquiry designed to uncover symptoms the client may have forgotten or deemed irrelevant, which often reveal the broader systemic pattern."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unexplained rapid weight loss and night sweats are 'Red Flags' that require medical investigation to rule out serious underlying pathologies like malignancy or infection."
