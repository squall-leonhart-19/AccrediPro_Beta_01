            "question": "A client presents with a dry, non-productive, hacking cough that worsens at night, accompanied by a 'scratchy' throat and thin, red tongue. According to the HERB framework, which tissue state and remedy class are most indicated?",
            "options": [
                "Damp/Stagnation; Stimulating Expectorants",
                "Dry/Atrophy; Demulcents and Relaxing Expectorants",
                "Cold/Depression; Warming Pungents",
                "Hot/Excitation; Lymphatics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A dry, non-productive cough with a thin red tongue indicates a Dry/Atrophy tissue state. Demulcents (like Althaea officinalis) and relaxing expectorants (like Prunus serotina) are required to hydrate the mucosa and soothe the cough reflex."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Which herb is classified as a 'stimulating expectorant' due to its high saponin content and ability to irritate the gastric mucosa to trigger a reflex increase in respiratory secretions?",
            "options": [
                "Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow)",
                "Prunus serotina (Wild Cherry Bark)",
                "Inula helenium (Elecampane)",
                "Verbascum thapsus (Mullein Leaf)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inula helenium (Elecampane) is a classic stimulating expectorant. Its volatile oils and saponins stimulate the 'mucociliary escalator' and are indicated for damp, boggy conditions with stuck mucus."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In the context of Biological Integration (Pharmacology), why should an herbalist exercise caution when using Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice) in a client taking inhaled corticosteroids for asthma?",
            "options": [
                "It may cause immediate bronchospasm.",
                "It can potentiate the effect of corticosteroids by inhibiting the enzyme 11β-HSD, potentially increasing systemic side effects.",
                "It neutralizes the pH of the lung tissue, making the medication inert.",
                "It causes rapid degradation of the steroid molecules in the bloodstream."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glycyrrhiza glabra inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), which slows the breakdown of cortisol and exogenous corticosteroids, potentially leading to increased systemic steroid effects and potassium depletion."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which constituent found in Ammi visnaga (Khella) is known for its potent bronchodilatory effects and served as the template for the pharmaceutical drug Cromolyn sodium?",

                "Thymol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Khellin is a furanochromone found in Ammi visnaga. It acts as a smooth muscle relaxant and mast cell stabilizer, which led to the development of the asthma medication Cromolyn sodium."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "The 'Gut-Lung Axis' suggests that the health of the pulmonary system is deeply connected to the intestinal microbiome. What specific metabolite produced by gut bacteria is crucial for modulating lung inflammation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, acetate, and propionate, enter systemic circulation and signal to the bone marrow to produce specialized immune cells that reduce inflammation in the lungs."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "When assessing a client with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which physiological sign is most characteristic of 'Pink Puffers' (Emphysema) compared to 'Blue Bloaters' (Chronic Bronchitis)?",
            "options": [
                "Productive cough with significant edema",
                "Cyanosis and high mucus production",

                "Low respiratory rate and normal oxygen saturation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emphysema (Pink Puffers) is characterized by the destruction of alveoli, leading to hyperinflation of the lungs (barrel chest) and the use of pursed-lip breathing to maintain airway pressure."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Freeze-dried Urtica dioica (Nettle) is clinically used for allergic rhinitis due to its ability to inhibit mast cell degranulation and block histamine receptors."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "Prunus serotina (Wild Cherry Bark) is specifically indicated for which type of respiratory presentation?",
            "options": [
                "A wet, productive cough that needs more movement",
                "An irritable, persistent cough that prevents sleep or causes exhaustion",

                "Loss of voice due to chronic shouting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prunus serotina is a sedative/relaxing expectorant. It is used to calm an overactive cough reflex, especially when the cough is unproductive and exhausting to the client."

                "Heavy sedatives to suppress the cough reflex entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic 'morning phlegm' in a smoker typically indicates a Cold/Damp/Stagnant state. Warming stimulants are needed to increase circulation and expectoration to clear the accumulated 'dampness'."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Safety check: Why is the long-term, internal use of Tussilago farfara (Coltsfoot) generally discouraged in clinical practice?",
            "options": [
                "It causes permanent staining of the teeth.",
                "It contains unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) which are hepatotoxic and can cause veno-occlusive disease.",
                "It is a potent hallucinogen in small doses.",
                "It leads to immediate kidney failure after a single cup of tea."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coltsfoot contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which can cause cumulative liver damage. While traditionally used for coughs, modern clinical standards suggest limiting its use or using PA-free extracts."
