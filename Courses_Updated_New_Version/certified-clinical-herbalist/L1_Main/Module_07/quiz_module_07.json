            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Which specific cell type is responsible for the breakdown of bone matrix and the release of calcium into the bloodstream, a process that must be balanced with osteoblast activity to maintain bone density?",
            "options": [
                "Osteoclasts",
                "Osteocytes",
                "Chondrocytes",
                "Osteoblasts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Osteoclasts are the cells responsible for bone resorption (breakdown). Osteoblasts build bone, and an imbalance where osteoclast activity exceeds osteoblast activity leads to decreased bone density."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic joint pain that feels 'heavy,' is worse in damp weather, and is accompanied by visible swelling without significant redness. In the system of energetic assessment, which tissue state does this represent?",
            "options": [
                "Heat/Excitation",
                "Dry/Atrophy",
                "Damp/Stagnation",
                "Cold/Depression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Damp/Stagnation is characterized by heaviness, swelling (edema), and aggravation by external dampness. This differs from Heat/Excitation, which would present with redness and heat."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Which alkaloid-rich herb, often used as a potent anodyne, works primarily by inhibiting dopamine receptor binding and has been shown in studies to be effective for neuropathic and inflammatory pain?",
            "options": [
                "Valeriana officinalis",
                "Corydalis yanhusuo",
                "Salix alba",
                "Viburnum opulus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Corydalis yanhusuo contains dehydrocorybulbine (DHCB), which acts on dopamine receptors to provide significant pain relief, making it a premier herbal anodyne."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "When managing an acute Grade I sprain, what is the primary rationale for using a 'vulnerary' herb like Symphytum officinale (Comfrey) topically after the initial inflammatory phase?",
            "options": [
                "To induce systemic sedation and rest",
                "To provide immediate numbing of the nerve endings",
                "To stimulate cell proliferation and rapid tissue regeneration via allantoin",
                "To act as a primary circulatory stimulant to increase bruising"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Comfrey is a classic vulnerary containing allantoin, which stimulates cell proliferation (mitosis), speeding the healing of connective tissues and skin."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "How does the clinical presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) typically differ from Osteoarthritis (OA) regarding morning stiffness?",
            "options": [
                "RA stiffness lasts less than 30 minutes; OA stiffness lasts all day",
                "RA involves only large weight-bearing joints; OA involves only small joints",
                "RA stiffness typically lasts longer than 1 hour; OA stiffness usually resolves within 30 minutes",
                "There is no difference in the duration of morning stiffness between the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A hallmark of the autoimmune inflammatory nature of RA is prolonged morning stiffness (often >1 hour), whereas the 'wear and tear' stiffness of OA typically improves quickly with movement (usually <30 minutes)."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Which herb-drug interaction is of greatest concern when a client is taking high-dose Aspirin or Warfarin while also using Filipendula ulmaria (Meadowsweet)?",
            "options": [
                "Antagonistic effect on the liver enzymes",
                "Increased risk of gastric ulceration and bleeding due to additive salicylate effects",
                "Reduced absorption of the pharmaceutical medication in the small intestine",
                "Spiking of blood glucose levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meadowsweet contains salicylates. When combined with other salicylate-containing drugs (Aspirin) or anticoagulants (Warfarin), it can increase the risk of thinning the blood too much or irritating the gastric lining."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "In the context of topical formulation for joint pain, what is the purpose of adding a 'rubefacient' like Capsicum or Ginger to a salve?",
            "options": [
                "To cool the area and reduce Heat/Excitation",
                "To act as a preservative for the carrier oil",
                "To increase local blood flow and 'draw' metabolic waste away from the joint",
                "To prevent the absorption of other herbs into the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rubefacients cause local vasodilation (reddening of the skin), which increases circulation to the area, helping to bring in fresh nutrients and remove metabolic waste products from stagnant tissues."

        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "According to the lesson on bone longevity, which mineral-rich herb provides highly bioavailable silica, essential for the cross-linking of collagen fibers in the bone matrix?",
            "options": [
                "Equisetum arvense (Horsetail)",
                "Arctium lappa (Burdock)",

                "Passiflora incarnata (Passionflower)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Horsetail is one of the richest plant sources of silica, which is a critical trace mineral for bone mineral density and the structural integrity of connective tissue."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 5 described a client with Osteoarthritis who failed to see results with Devil's Claw after 2 weeks. Based on clinical data, what is the most appropriate advice?",
            "options": [
                "Stop the herb immediately as it is clearly ineffective for this client",
                "Increase the dose by 500% to achieve a 'loading' effect",
                "Continue for at least 8-12 weeks, as the therapeutic effect of Harpagophytum often takes months to peak",
                "Switch to a sedative herb like Skullcap"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical trials on Harpagophytum procumbens (Devil's Claw) indicate that while some benefit may be felt early, the full therapeutic effect for chronic OA typically requires 2 to 3 months of consistent use."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which herbal action is specifically defined as 'relieving involuntary muscle spasms,' making it essential for treating conditions like tension headaches or lower back spasms?",

                "Astringent",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Antispasmodics (like Cramp Bark or Black Haw) reduce overactivity and involuntary contractions in skeletal or smooth muscle tissue."
