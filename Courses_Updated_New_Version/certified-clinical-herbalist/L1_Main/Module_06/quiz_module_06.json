            "question": "According to the Clinical Follow-up Framework (L1), what is the primary objective of the first follow-up session, typically scheduled 2-4 weeks after the initial consultation?",
            "options": [
                "To perform a complete overhaul of the initial protocol",
                "To assess safety, tolerance, and initial compliance with the protocol",
                "To discharge the client as 'healed' if symptoms have improved",
                "To introduce advanced heroic herbs that were too strong for the first visit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first follow-up is primarily about monitoring for adverse reactions, ensuring the client understands how to take their herbs (compliance), and assessing their initial response to the formula."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "When utilizing the Metabolic Screening Questionnaire (MSQ) for longitudinal tracking (L2), which of the following indicates a clinically significant 'Major Improvement'?",
            "options": [
                "A 5% reduction in total score",
                "A 10% increase in total score",
                "A 30% or greater reduction in the total score",
                "The score remaining exactly the same for three consecutive months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In clinical practice, a 30% or greater reduction in the MSQ score is considered a significant milestone, indicating that the protocol is effectively addressing systemic imbalances."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "The 'Art of Protocol Titration' (L3) suggests 'Micro-titration' for sensitive clients. What does this specifically involve?",
            "options": [
                "Taking the full dose only once per week",
                "Starting at 1/4 or 1/8 of the standard therapeutic dose and increasing slowly",
                "Mixing the herbs with large amounts of honey to mask the taste",
                "Using only homeopathic dilutions rather than herbal extracts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-titration involves starting with very small fractions of a standard dose to ensure the client's system can handle the herbs without a 'healing crisis' or adverse reaction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "When a client encounters a 'Healing Plateau' (L4), where progress stalls after initial success, what is the practitioner's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Doubling the dosage of all current herbs immediately",
                "Investigating 'Therapeutic Fatigue' and checking for protocol compliance",
                "Referring the client to a different practitioner immediately",
                "Telling the client that herbs no longer work for them"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before changing the formula, the practitioner must determine if the plateau is due to the client stopping the protocol (therapeutic fatigue) or if the body has reached a state of homeostasis with the current dose."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Research on 'Complexity Interference' (L5) shows that client compliance drops significantly when a protocol becomes too difficult. What is the recommended 'Golden Rule' for daily herbal dosing frequency?",
            "options": [
                "Dosing every 2 hours while awake",
                "A maximum of 2 to 3 dosing events per day",
                "Only dosing once every 48 hours",
                "Dosing only when the client remembers to do so"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compliance is highest when protocols are integrated into existing routines (e.g., breakfast and dinner). Exceeding 3 doses per day often leads to missed doses and therapeutic failure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "During the transition to the 'Maintenance Phase' (L6), which category of herbs is most appropriate for long-term use to support 'longevity'?",
            "options": [
                "Strong purgative laxatives",
                "Low-dose heroic alkaloids",
                "Trophorestoratives and Adaptogens",
                "Antimicrobial volatiles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trophorestoratives (organ-nourishing herbs) and Adaptogens are the foundation of maintenance protocols because they support systemic resilience without over-stimulating the body."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "In the SOAP note format for longitudinal documentation (L7), where should a practitioner record the client's reported 'Energy Level' on a scale of 1-10?",
            "options": [
                "Subjective (S)",
                "Objective (O)",
                "Assessment (A)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Subjective' section includes the client's self-reported feelings, symptoms, and self-assessments like energy or pain scales."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "When making 'Seasonal Adjustments' (L8) for a client with a 'Cold' constitution entering the winter months, which herbal action should be emphasized?",
            "options": [
                "Refrigerant (Cooling)",
                "Circulatory Stimulant (Warming)",
                "Diaphoretic (Sweat-inducing) at high doses daily",
                "Strong Sedative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Seasonal adjustments involve counteracting environmental influences. In winter, warming circulatory stimulants like Ginger or Cinnamon help maintain constitutional balance."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client has been taking a formula for 12 months for chronic joint support. They feel great but are worried about 'becoming dependent.' What is the best clinical response based on Module 6 principles?",
            "options": [
                "Tell them to stop all herbs immediately to 'test' their body",
                "Explain the concept of 'Tonic Support' and transition to a pulse-dosing schedule",
                "Increase the dose to prove they aren't dependent",
                "Tell them they must take the herbs for the rest of their life without breaks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pulse dosing (e.g., 5 days on, 2 days off) allows the body's own regulatory mechanisms to remain active while still benefiting from the tonic support of the herbs."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "How should a practitioner adjust the dosage for an elderly client (70+) compared to a younger adult when managing long-term follow-up?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the dose because elderly people have more symptoms",
                "Use only powder forms because they cannot swallow liquids",
                "Start with lower doses (e.g., 1/2 dose) due to potential changes in hepatic and renal clearance",
                "Dosage should never be changed based on age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to naturally declining kidney and liver function in aging, elderly clients often require lower doses to achieve therapeutic effects while avoiding accumulation or toxicity."
