        {
            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which component of the immune system provides a non-specific, immediate response to pathogens through mechanisms like phagocytosis and the inflammatory cascade?",
            "options": [
                "Adaptive Immune System",
                "Innate Immune System",
                "Humoral Immunity",
                "Cell-Mediated Memory System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The innate immune system is the first line of defense, providing rapid, non-specific responses including physical barriers, phagocytic cells (neutrophils/macrophages), and inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system lacks a central pump. What is the primary mechanism for moving lymph fluid through the vessels?",
            "options": [
                "Cardiac output and arterial pressure",
                "Skeletal muscle contraction and rhythmic vessel wall movement",
                "Pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange",
                "Hepatic portal circulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lymphatic flow depends on the 'musculovenous pump' (skeletal muscle contraction), respiratory pressure changes, and the intrinsic contractions of lymphatic vessel walls (lymphangions)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A clinical herbalist is working with a client who has a history of seasonal 'lingering' colds. Which category of herbs is most appropriate for long-term use (3-6 months) to build 'Deep Immune' resilience?",
            "options": [
                "Immune Stimulants (e.g., Echinacea purpurea)",
                "Immune Modulators (e.g., Astragalus membranaceus)",
                "Antipyretics (e.g., Salix alba)",
                "Lymphatic Alteratives (e.g., Galium aparine)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Immunomodulators like Astragalus are used for long-term 'tonification' of the immune system, whereas stimulants like Echinacea are generally reserved for acute, short-term activation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In the management of a 'stagnant' fever where the client feels chilled and has dry skin, which class of herbs is indicated to help the body reach the 'flush' stage?",
            "options": [
                "Cold Sedatives",
                "Stimulating Diaphoretics",
                "Relaxing Diaphoretics",
                "Astringents"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulating diaphoretics (like Ginger or Cayenne) increase peripheral circulation and help 'push' a fever that is stuck in the cold/chill phase to its resolution."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "According to the module's discussion on autoimmunity, why is the long-term use of potent immune stimulants like Echinacea often cautioned in conditions like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?",
            "options": [
                "They may cause hepatotoxicity in autoimmune clients",
                "They might further stimulate the overactive Th1 or Th2 pathways driving the tissue damage",
                "They are known to deplete the bone marrow's white blood cell reserve",
                "They interfere with the absorption of Vitamin D3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune conditions, the goal is often modulation rather than stimulation; potent stimulants can potentially exacerbate the existing imbalance in T-helper cell pathways."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Which specialized dendritic cells located in the epidermis act as the 'sentinels' of the integumentary immune system, capturing antigens and migrating to lymph nodes?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Langerhans cells are the primary antigen-presenting cells of the skin, bridging the gap between the skin's barrier function and the systemic immune response."

                "No statistical difference compared to placebo",
                "An increase in bacterial secondary infections"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These agents work primarily by stabilizing the membranes of mast cells, preventing them from degranulating and releasing histamine and other inflammatory mediators."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with swollen cervical lymph nodes, 'brain fog,' and slow wound healing following a viral illness. Which 'Lymphatic Alterative' herb is best suited for moving thick, stagnant lymph in the neck and head region?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phytolacca (Poke Root) is a powerful lymphatic stimulant specifically indicated for hard, swollen glands and lymphatic congestion, though it must be used with extreme caution and low dosing."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Immune Resilience' and longevity, what is the 'Bi-Directional' relationship between the HPA axis and the immune system?",
            "options": [
                "The immune system only responds to the HPA axis during sleep",
                "Cortisol from the HPA axis suppresses acute inflammation, while cytokines from the immune system can activate the HPA axis",
                "The HPA axis produces white blood cells during times of stress",
                "There is no connection; they operate as entirely independent systems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This is the core of psychoneuroimmunology: stress hormones (cortisol) modulate immune function, and immune signals (cytokines) travel to the brain to trigger the stress response."
