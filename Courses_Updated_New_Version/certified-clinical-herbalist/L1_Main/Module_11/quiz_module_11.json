            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "In the context of immunology fundamentals, which cell type is considered the primary bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems due to its role in antigen presentation?",
            "options": ["Natural Killer (NK) Cells", "Dendritic Cells", "Neutrophils", "Basophils"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dendritic cells are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that capture pathogens, migrate to lymph nodes, and present antigens to T-cells, effectively bridging innate and adaptive responses."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Wind-Cold' symptoms: clear nasal discharge, chills, no sweating, and a stiff neck. Which category of herbs is most appropriate for this energetic pattern?",
            "options": ["Cold and Bitter Alteratives", "Nourishing Yin Tonics", "Warm Acrid Surface Releasers", "Cooling Immunomodulators"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Warm acrid surface releasers (diaphoretics) like Fresh Ginger or Boneset are used to 'release the exterior' by inducing diaphoresis and expelling the Cold pathogen."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the Materia Medica of polysaccharides, what is the primary molecular mechanism by which fungal beta-glucans (like those in Reishi) stimulate immune surveillance?",
            "options": ["Direct lysis of viral envelopes", "Binding to Dectin-1 receptors on macrophages", "Inhibiting the production of Interleukin-10", "Increasing gastric acid production"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-molecular-weight polysaccharides, specifically beta-1,3/1,6-glucans, bind to Dectin-1 and Complement Receptor 3 (CR3) on macrophages and NK cells to 'prime' the immune system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "In clinical protocols for autoimmunity, why is Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) sometimes used with caution during an acute, high-fever infection?",
            "options": ["It is too cooling and may suppress the fever too quickly", "It may 'lock the pathogen in' the deeper layers of the body", "It causes immediate depletion of T-cells", "It interferes with the absorption of vitamin C"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), tonifying herbs like Astragalus are avoided during the peak of an acute 'Exterior' invasion because they can strengthen the pathogen's hold or 'lock it in' the body."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Which specific lymphatic herb is indicated for 'boggy' tissues, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and a 'sandy' feeling in the urine (urolithiasis)?",
            "options": ["Galium aparine (Cleavers)", "Phytolacca americana (Poke Root)", "Trifolium pratense (Red Clover)", "Baptisia tinctoria (Wild Indigo)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cleavers (Galium aparine) is a classic 'alterative' and lymphatic tonic specifically indicated for swollen nodes, fluid stagnation (edema), and as a mild diuretic for urinary irritation."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In the Th1/Th2 balance model, which cytokine profile is typically associated with the 'allergic cascade' and IgE-mediated hypersensitivity?",
            "options": ["Th1 Dominance (IFN-gamma, IL-2)", "Th2 Dominance (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13)", "Th17 Dominance (IL-17, IL-22)", "T-Reg Dominance (TGF-beta)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Th2 dominance promotes B-cell class switching to IgE and the activation of eosinophils and mast cells, which are the hallmarks of allergies and asthma."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis (Hawkins et al.) regarding Elderberry (Sambucus nigra) supplementation for viral respiratory symptoms found that it reduced symptom duration by an average of how many days?",
            "options": ["1 day", "2 days", "4 days", "7 days"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis of 180 participants found that Elderberry significantly reduced the total duration of upper respiratory symptoms by an average of 4 days compared to placebo."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Which herb contains the flavonoid Quercetin and is clinically used as a mast cell stabilizer to prevent the release of histamine in seasonal allergies?",
            "options": ["Echinacea purpurea", "Urtica dioica (Nettle)", "Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi)", "Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nettle (Urtica dioica) contains quercetin and other constituents that inhibit mast cell degranulation and the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "When formulating using the 'Triangle' strategy for chronic immune depletion, which layer should represent the foundation (base) of the formula?",
            "options": ["Acute Immunostimulants (e.g., Echinacea)", "Lymphatic Alteratives (e.g., Blue Flag)", "Deep Immunomodulators/Adaptogens (e.g., Reishi, Astragalus)", "Symptomatic Relievers (e.g., Peppermint)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For chronic depletion, the foundation of the formula should be deep immunomodulators and adaptogens that build 'Wei Qi' and support long-term resilience."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Poke Root (Phytolacca americana) is a potent lymphatic 'low-dose' herb. What is its specific clinical indication regarding the texture of lymph nodes?",
            "options": ["Hard, stony, or fixed nodes", "Soft, fluctuating, and painless nodes", "Nodes that are hot, red, and rapidly spreading", "Nodes that disappear in the morning and reappear at night"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phytolacca is traditionally used for 'hard,' congested, or stony lymph nodes and mammary congestion, but must be used in very small, drop-level doses due to its potential toxicity."
