            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "Which molecule, synthesized by the endothelium, is primarily responsible for vasodilation and the prevention of leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall?",
            "options": ["Angiotensin II", "Nitric Oxide (NO)", "Endothelin-1", "Homocysteine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nitric Oxide (NO) is the critical signaling molecule produced by the endothelium that maintains vascular tone through vasodilation and protects against atherosclerosis by preventing platelet and leukocyte adhesion."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the energetic assessment of the heart, a 'Heart Fire' pattern in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is most likely to present with which clinical symptom?",
            "options": ["Bradycardia and cold extremities", "Edema in the lower ankles", "Mouth ulcers, palpitations, and restlessness", "Pale tongue with a thin white coat"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heart Fire is an excess heat pattern often manifesting as restlessness, sleep disturbances, palpitations, and physical signs of heat like mouth ulcers or a red tongue tip."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Which constituent in Crataegus spp. (Hawthorn) is primarily credited with increasing the refractory period of the myocardium and enhancing coronary blood flow?",
            "options": ["Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins (OPCs)", "Reserpine", "Cardiac Glycosides", "Allicin"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hawthorn's OPCs and flavonoids are responsible for its trophorestorative effects, improving the heart's functional capacity and antioxidant status without the toxicity associated with cardiac glycosides."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the interstitial fluid filtered by the capillaries is returned to the venous circulation via the lymphatic system daily?",
            "options": ["50%", "10%", "90%", "25%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the majority of fluid is reabsorbed by the venous ends of capillaries, approximately 10% remains in the tissue and must be returned via the lymphatic system to prevent lymphedema."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "When using Phytolacca americana (Pokeweed) as a lymphagogue, what is the standard safety protocol regarding dosage?",
            "options": ["3-5 mL of tincture three times daily", "10-20 drops of the essential oil internally", "1-10 drops of the fresh root tincture per dose", "It should only be used as a dried root infusion (1 cup daily)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phytolacca is a 'low-dose' botanical. Due to its potential for toxicity (mitogenic properties), it is typically dosed in drop increments (1-10 drops) rather than milliliters."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "A clinical trial on Aesculus hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) for Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) found that its primary active constituent, aescin, works by:",
            "options": ["Increasing blood viscosity", "Reducing capillary permeability and inhibiting lysosomal enzymes", "Acting as a systemic anticoagulant like Warfarin", "Stimulating the production of Red Blood Cells"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aescin reduces the 'leakiness' of capillaries (permeability) by sealing the vessel walls and inhibiting enzymes that break down the vascular basement membrane."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Which herb is considered a potent hypotensive due to its ability to deplete catecholamines, but requires strict monitoring for side effects like depression and nasal congestion?",
            "options": ["Leonurus cardiaca", "Rauwolfia serpentina", "Tilia europaea", "Viscum album"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rauwolfia (containing reserpine) is a powerful hypotensive that works via catecholamine depletion; however, it is rarely a first-line therapy today due to significant side effects like clinical depression."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A client is currently taking the pharmaceutical Warfarin (Coumadin). Which of the following herbs is strictly contraindicated due to its potential to increase the risk of hemorrhage?",
            "options": ["Galium aparine", "Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen)", "Taraxacum officinale leaf", "Crataegus oxyacantha"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen) has potent antiplatelet and anticoagulant effects that can synergize dangerously with Warfarin, significantly increasing INR and bleeding risk."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Alterative' therapy, why is the lymphatic system addressed alongside the liver and kidneys?",
            "options": ["To increase the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins only", "To ensure metabolic waste moved from the extracellular matrix is properly transported for excretion", "Because the lymphatic system is the primary site of bile production", "To bypass the circulatory system entirely"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alteratives work by improving the 'quality of the blood' and tissue health; this requires efficient lymphatic drainage to move waste from the interstitial space (the matrix) to the primary emunctories."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which botanical is specifically indicated for 'palpitations associated with anxiety' and is often described as a 'mother's embrace' for the nervous heart?",
            "options": ["Digitalis purpurea", "Aesculus hippocastanum", "Leonurus cardiaca", "Iris versicolor"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leonurus cardiaca (Motherwort) is the classic remedy for the 'nervous heart,' specifically indicated for palpitations, tachycardia, and anxiety-induced cardiac symptoms."
