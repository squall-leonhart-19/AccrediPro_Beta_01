            "question": "Which specific constituent group in Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) is primarily responsible for its ability to increase the force of myocardial contraction while simultaneously dilating coronary arteries?",
            "options": [
                "Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) and flavonoids",
                "Cardiac glycosides like digitoxin",
                "Tropane alkaloids",
                "Steroidal saponins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hawthorn's cardiotonic effects are attributed to its OPCs and flavonoids, which inhibit phosphodiesterase, increasing cAMP levels in the myocardium and promoting vasodilation and mild positive inotropic effects without the toxicity of glycosides."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the Energetic Patterns of the Heart (Lesson 2), a client presenting with palpitations, a red tip on the tongue, and 'restless spirit' (Shen) insomnia would most likely be categorized under which pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Heart Blood Deficiency",
                "Heart Fire",
                "Heart Yang Collapse",
                "Phlegm Misting the Heart"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Fire is characterized by heat signs (red tongue tip), restlessness, and palpitations. This pattern often requires cooling nervines and bitter heart-sedatives like Motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca)."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which Rauwolfia serpentina (Indian Snakeroot) lowers blood pressure, and why is it used with extreme caution in clinical practice?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a calcium channel blocker; causes peripheral edema",
                "It depletes catecholamines (norepinephrine) by inhibiting VMAT; can cause severe depression",
                "It is a potent diuretic; causes potassium wasting",
                "It inhibits ACE enzymes; causes a dry, non-productive cough"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rauwolfia contains reserpine, which depletes norepinephrine stores. While highly effective for hypertension, it is notorious for causing deep clinical depression and is generally reserved for cases resistant to other botanical interventions."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "According to the 2023 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 4, standardized Garlic (Allium sativum) supplementation was shown to reduce Total Cholesterol by what average percentage in hyperlipidemic patients?",
            "options": [
                "2-5%",
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "Garlic showed no statistical significance in lipid reduction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that consistent use of standardized garlic preparations (providing adequate allicin yield) results in a 10-15% reduction in total cholesterol and LDL, making it a cornerstone of botanical lipid management."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which 'low-dose' lymphagogue is specifically indicated for hard, enlarged cervical lymph nodes but requires strict adherence to drop-dosing due to its potential for systemic toxicity and emesis?",
            "options": [
                "Galium aparine (Cleavers)",
                "Calendula officinalis (Marigold)",
                "Phytolacca decandra (Poke Root)",
                "Trifolium pratense (Red Clover)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phytolacca (Poke Root) is a powerful lymphagogue for glandular swelling but is considered a 'low-dose' herb. Excessive doses can cause severe vomiting, purging, and respiratory depression."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "When assessing edema in Lesson 7, a 'non-pitting' edema that feels firm or 'brawny' to the touch is most characteristic of which underlying pathology?",
            "options": [
                "Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)",
                "Chronic Venous Insufficiency",

                "Acute Renal Failure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike cardiac or renal edema which is usually 'pitting' (leaves an indentation), chronic lymphedema often results in fibrotic tissue changes, leading to non-pitting, firm swelling."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Red Root (Ceanothus americanus) is distinguished from other lymphagogues by its specific affinity for which organ/tissue?",
            "options": [
                "The Spleen and portal circulation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Red Root is a unique 'organ remedy' with a specific affinity for the spleen. It is used clinically for splenic enlargement, portal congestion, and to reduce the viscosity of the blood and lymph."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A client taking Warfarin (Coumadin) for atrial fibrillation should avoid high therapeutic doses of Dan Shen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "Dan Shen contains Vitamin K and inhibits the drug's action",
                "Dan Shen has potent antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects that may potentiate the drug's effect, increasing bleeding risk",
                "Dan Shen induces CYP3A4, clearing the drug too quickly from the system",
                "Dan Shen causes vasoconstriction, opposing the drug's purpose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dan Shen is a powerful 'Blood Vitalizer' in TCM that inhibits platelet aggregation and enhances fibrinolysis. Combining it with Warfarin significantly increases the risk of hemorrhage."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Which herbal energetic pairing is most appropriate for a client with 'Damp-Heat' in the lymphatic system, manifesting as swollen, hot, and painful lymph nodes?",
            "options": [
                "Warm and Pungent (e.g., Ginger and Prickly Ash)",
                "Cool and Alterative (e.g., Figwort and Blue Flag)",
                "Hot and Stimulating (e.g., Cayenne and Garlic)",
                "Dry and Astringent (e.g., Oak Bark and Witch Hazel)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For Damp-Heat patterns, herbs that are cooling and move 'stagnant fluids' (alteratives) are required. Scrophularia (Figwort) and Iris versicolor (Blue Flag) are classic choices for hot, boggy lymphatic stagnation."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Lymphatic-Immune' connection (Lesson 5), what percentage of the body's total lymphocytes are typically found circulating in the blood at any given time?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 2%",
                "Approximately 25%",

                "Over 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Only about 2% of the body's lymphocytes are in the blood; the vast majority reside within the lymphatic tissues (nodes, spleen, thymus, GALT). This highlights why supporting lymphatic flow is critical for systemic immunity."
