            "question": "In the context of Energetic Herbalism, what is the primary objective of a clinical assessment?",
            "options": [
                "To match a specific botanical species to a specific disease name",
                "To identify the 'tissue state' of the individual and match it with the energetic properties of a plant",
                "To replace conventional blood tests with tongue and pulse diagnosis exclusively",
                "To determine the chemical constituents of the plant regardless of the patient's constitution"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic herbalism focuses on identifying the underlying pattern or 'tissue state' (heat, cold, damp, dry, etc.) and matching it with the corrective energetic qualities of the herb."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a pale tongue, a slow pulse, a preference for warm beverages, and chronic fatigue. Which energetic axis is most likely imbalanced?",
            "options": [
                "Excess Heat (Excitation)",
                "Systemic Dryness (Atrophy)",
                "Systemic Cold (Depression)",
                "Tension (Constriction)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Paleness, slow pulse, and a desire for warmth are hallmark indicators of the 'Cold' or 'Depression' tissue state, where metabolic functions are underactive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which herbal action is specifically indicated for the 'Damp Relaxation' (Atony) tissue state, characterized by 'leaking' fluids such as chronic diarrhea or excessive sweating?",
            "options": [
                "Demulcents",
                "Astringents",
                "Humectants",
                "Relaxing Diaphoretics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Astringents contain tannins that 'knit' or tighten relaxed, leaking tissues, making them the primary choice for Damp Relaxation/Atony."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "During a visual assessment, you notice the sides of the client's tongue are significantly redder than the rest of the body. According to the tongue map, which organ system does this primarily reflect?",
            "options": [
                "The Heart and Lungs",
                "The Kidneys and Bladder",
                "The Liver and Gallbladder",
                "The Digestive Center (Spleen/Stomach)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In traditional energetic mapping, the sides of the tongue reflect the state of the Liver and Gallbladder; redness here often indicates 'Liver Fire' or Heat/Tension in those systems."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A 'Wiry' pulse—feeling like a taut guitar string under the fingers—is most commonly associated with which tissue state?",
            "options": [
                "Tension (Wind/Constriction)",
                "Damp Stagnation (Torpor)",
                "Dry Atrophy",
                "Cold Depression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A wiry pulse indicates 'Tension' or 'Wind,' reflecting a state of constriction in the nervous system or smooth muscles."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "What does a 'thick, yellow, greasy' coating on the back of the tongue typically signify in a clinical synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Dryness in the Lungs",
                "Damp-Heat in the Lower Burner (Intestines/Bladder)",
                "Cold-Damp in the Heart",
                "Constitutional Vitality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A thick coating indicates dampness, while a yellow color indicates heat. The back of the tongue corresponds to the 'Lower Burner' or lower abdominal organs."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Dry/Atrophy' tissue state?",
            "options": [
                "Overactive secretions and rapid metabolism",
                "Hard, calloused skin and excessive mucous production",
                "Withered tissues, lack of lubrication, and loss of function due to 'starvation' of fluids",
                "Acute inflammation with redness and swelling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dryness/Atrophy is characterized by a lack of essential fluids (Yin deficiency), leading to withered, brittle, or non-functional tissues."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client with 'Damp Stagnation' (Torpor) would most likely benefit from which category of herbs?",
            "options": [
                "Pungent, warming stimulants and alteratives",
                "Cooling demulcents like Marshmallow root",
                "Heavy, nutritive tonics",
                "Astringents like Oak bark"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Damp Stagnation requires 'moving' and 'warming' actions to clear the accumulation of fluids and metabolic waste; pungent stimulants help increase circulation and resolve torpor."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "When assessing the 'Axis of Tone,' a client presenting with 'Relaxation/Atony' would show which clinical sign?",
            "options": [
                "Sharp, cramping pains that come and go",
                "A tongue that is long, pointed, and trembling",
                "Prolapsed organs or chronic loose stools with a 'boggy' feel",
                "A tight, 'ropey' pulse quality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Relaxation (Atony) is a loss of structural integrity or tone, leading to prolapse, sagging, and an inability to hold fluids."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "In synthesizing an energetic picture, if a client has a 'Red, peeled (no coat) tongue' and a 'Rapid, thready pulse,' what is the most likely energetic diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "Excess Damp-Heat",
                "Yin Deficiency (Heat + Dryness)",
                "Yang Deficiency (Cold + Damp)",
                "Acute Wind-Cold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A red tongue indicates heat, the lack of coating indicates dryness/fluid loss, and a thready, rapid pulse indicates the body is working hard with very little fluid volume (Yin Deficiency)."
