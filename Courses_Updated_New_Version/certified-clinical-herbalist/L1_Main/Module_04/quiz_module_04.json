            "question": "In the context of Botanical Pharmacokinetics (ADME), what does the 'First-Pass Effect' primarily refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The initial absorption of phytochemicals through the mucosal lining of the stomach.",
                "The rapid metabolism of an orally administered herb in the liver before it reaches systemic circulation.",
                "The binding of herbal constituents to plasma proteins like albumin.",
                "The excretion of herbal metabolites through the renal tubules."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first-pass effect (or first-pass metabolism) occurs when the concentration of a substance is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation, primarily due to metabolism in the liver after oral ingestion."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a potent inducer of which enzyme system, potentially leading to sub-therapeutic levels of drugs like cyclosporine and oral contraceptives?",

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'Pharmacodynamic' interaction rather than a 'Pharmacokinetic' interaction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when the herb and drug have additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects at the receptor level or on a physiological system (like potassium levels), rather than changing the drug's concentration in the blood."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Polypharmacology describes the 'multi-target' nature of whole-plant extracts, where various phytochemicals act on different receptors or pathways simultaneously to produce a therapeutic effect."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aging is associated with a decline in renal function (reduced GFR), which slows the excretion of herbal metabolites and drugs, significantly increasing the risk of accumulation and toxicity."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which efflux transporter acts as a 'biological vacuum cleaner,' pumping herbal constituents and drugs out of cells and back into the intestinal lumen or bile?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-dependent efflux transporter that limits the absorption and increases the elimination of many substances by pumping them out of the cells."

                "Garlic has antiplatelet effects that may have an additive effect with Warfarin, increasing bleeding risk.",
                "Garlic will induce CYP2C9, causing the Warfarin to be metabolized too quickly.",
                "Garlic contains high amounts of Vitamin K, which will neutralize the effects of Warfarin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Garlic's effect on the INR is sometimes debated, its known antiplatelet activity can provide a pharmacodynamic additive effect with anticoagulants like Warfarin, increasing the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase II metabolism involves conjugation reactions, where a polar group (like glucuronic acid, sulfate, or glutathione) is attached to the molecule to increase its water solubility for easier excretion via urine or bile."
