            "options": ["The King (Emperor)", "The Minister (Associate)", "The Assistant (Adjuvant)", "The Messenger (Envoy)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "question": "What is the primary scientific advantage of using the percolation method over traditional maceration for herbal extractions?",
            "options": ["It requires less alcohol to achieve the same result", "It results in total exhaustion of the marc in a fraction of the time", "It prevents the extraction of bitter constituents", "It allows for the use of fresh plant material only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Percolation uses gravity and a continuous flow of menstruum to achieve 'total exhaustion' of the plant material, making it faster and more efficient than the static maceration process."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "During a clinical tongue assessment, a 'geographic' or 'peeled' tongue coating that lacks moisture in the center typically indicates which tissue state?",
            "options": ["Liver Qi Stagnation", "Excessive Damp-Heat in the Lower Burner", "Stomach and Spleen Yin Deficiency", "Heart Fire Blazing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A peeled or geographic tongue coating, especially in the center (the stomach/spleen area), is a classic indicator of Yin deficiency and a lack of fluids in the digestive system."

            "question": "Which low-dose botanical is characterized by its specific affinity for 'weeping, shifting, or moody' individuals and requires drop-dosing due to its high potency?",
            "options": ["Pulsatilla vulgaris (Pasque Flower)", "Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion)", "Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow)", "Crataegus monogyna (Hawthorn)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pulsatilla is a classic low-dose botanical used for specific constitutional types (weeping, changeable) and must be dosed carefully to avoid adverse effects."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is known to induce the CYP3A4 enzyme. What is the clinical implication of this for a client on pharmaceutical medication?",
            "options": ["It increases the plasma concentration of the drug, leading to toxicity", "It has no effect on drug metabolism", "It decreases the plasma concentration of the drug, potentially rendering it ineffective", "It blocks the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inducing the CYP3A4 enzyme speeds up the metabolism of drugs processed by that pathway, which lowers their concentration in the blood and can lead to therapeutic failure."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In Spagyric philosophy, the 'Three Essentials' consist of Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury. What does the 'Sulfur' principle represent in a plant?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Spagyrics, Sulfur represents the Soul, which contains the essential oils, fats, and resins that give the plant its unique 'personality' and therapeutic aroma."

            "options": ["Acute Inflammation", "Tension and Constriction", "Atrophy, coldness, and lack of vital function", "Damp Relaxation and excessive discharge"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tissue Depression is a state of 'under-activity' characterized by coldness and atrophy, requiring stimulating herbs to restore vital function."

            "options": ["Volatile oils only", "Water-soluble polysaccharides and alcohol-soluble triterpenes", "Chlorophyll and minerals", "Simple sugars and tannins"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Medicinal mushrooms contain beta-glucans (water-soluble) and triterpenes (alcohol-soluble); a dual extraction ensures both are present in the final medicine."
