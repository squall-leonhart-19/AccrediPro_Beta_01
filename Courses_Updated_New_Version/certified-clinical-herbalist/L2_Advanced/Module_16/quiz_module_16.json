            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms, characterized by high evening cortisol spikes and morning exhaustion. Which adaptogen is most clinically indicated to down-regulate the evening HPA-axis overshoot?",
            "options": [
                "Panax ginseng (Asian Ginseng)",
                "Rhodiola rosea (Roseroot)",
                "Ocimum sanctum (Holy Basil)",
                "Eleutherococcus senticosus (Eleuthero)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Holy Basil is specifically indicated for cortisol modulation, particularly when evening spikes prevent sleep, whereas Panax and Rhodiola are generally too stimulating for this specific 'wired' presentation."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In a case of active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or other Th1/Th2 imbalanced autoimmune flares, why is the use of Echinacea purpurea generally cautioned against?",
            "options": [
                "It causes rapid hepatotoxicity in autoimmune patients.",
                "It may non-specifically stimulate immune activity, potentially exacerbating the overactive response.",
                "It contains high levels of salicylates that interfere with steroids.",
                "It is a strong sedative that masks symptoms of a flare."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune complexity, non-specific immunostimulants (like Echinacea) can sometimes trigger or worsen a flare by further activating an already over-responsive immune system; modulators like Reishi or Astragalus are preferred in the long term."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A 2023 clinical review discussed in the Metabolic Syndrome lesson noted that 1500mg of Berberine daily was comparable to which pharmaceutical intervention for reducing HbA1c levels?",

                "Lisinopril",
                "Metformin",

                "Warfarin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine has been shown in multiple meta-analyses to have comparable efficacy to Metformin in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing HbA1c in patients with Metabolic Syndrome."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In the Gut-Brain Connection cases, which herb is considered a 'trophorestorative' for the enteric nervous system, helping to repair the gut lining while simultaneously calming the Vagus nerve?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chamomile acts as both a vulnerary for the GI mucosa and a mild nervine sedative, making it a primary choice for gut-brain axis dysregulation and 'nervous stomach' presentations."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When managing a geriatric patient who is taking Warfarin (Coumadin) for atrial fibrillation, which of the following herbs is strictly contraindicated due to its high coumarin content?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sweet Clover contains natural coumarins which can potentiate the anticoagulant effect of Warfarin, significantly increasing the risk of hemorrhage."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In complex perimenopause cases involving 'estrogen dominance' and luteal phase deficiency, how does Vitex agnus-castus primarily exert its effect?",
            "options": [
                "By acting as a direct phytoestrogen replacement.",
                "By stimulating the pituitary to increase Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and supporting progesterone production.",
                "By blocking all testosterone receptors in the ovaries.",
                "By increasing the clearance of progesterone through the liver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitex acts on the pituitary-ovarian axis to favor the production of LH, which supports the corpus luteum and progesterone levels, helping to balance the estrogen/progesterone ratio."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Milky Oat Tops are a premier nervous system trophorestorative for children, providing a grounding, nourishing effect that helps with sensory integration without the heavy sedation of Valerian or Hops."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "According to the 'Stuck Case' troubleshooting protocol, if a client shows no improvement after 3 months despite a theoretically correct protocol, what is the first 'Obstacle to Cure' that should be investigated?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In 'stuck' cases, herbalists must look for 'Obstacles to Cure'—external or internal factors like mold, hidden dental infections, or toxicity that prevent the body's vital force from responding to the herbs."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A 70-year-old client with congestive heart failure is taking Digoxin. Which herb must be avoided because it contains cardiac glycosides that can lead to fatal drug-herb synergy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lily of the Valley contains cardiac glycosides (like convallatoxin) which have a similar mechanism to Digoxin; combining them can lead to digitalis toxicity and cardiac arrest."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "In the clinical management of Metabolic Syndrome, what is the primary reason for combining Crataegus (Hawthorn) with Hibiscus in a protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the patient's appetite.",
                "To provide synergistic ACE-inhibiting and cardioprotective effects for blood pressure management.",
                "To mask the bitter taste of other herbs.",
                "To induce rapid weight loss through diuresis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hibiscus has clinical evidence for mild ACE-inhibition and blood pressure reduction, while Hawthorn improves cardiac output and protects the vascular endothelium, creating a synergistic effect for cardiovascular health."
