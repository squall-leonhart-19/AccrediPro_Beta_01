            "question": "In the 'Clinical Triage' hierarchy (Lesson 1), which system is prioritized first when a client presents with multi-system dysfunction to ensure foundational stability?",
            "options": [
                "Endocrine modulation (HPA Axis)",
                "Digestion and GI Integrity",
                "Nervous system sedation",
                "Immune system stimulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to the Clinical Triage model, the digestive system is addressed first to ensure nutrient absorption and eliminate systemic inflammation originating in the gut before addressing higher-level endocrine or immune issues."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client is taking the anticoagulant Warfarin. Which herb is contraindicated due to its induction of CYP3A4 enzymes, which can significantly lower the drug's plasma concentration?",
            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of the CYP450 enzyme system (specifically CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein, which increases the clearance of many drugs, including Warfarin and oral contraceptives."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "When working with Autoimmune Complexity (Lesson 3), what is the primary difference between an 'Immunostimulant' and an 'Immunomodulator'?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulants increase white blood cell count, while modulators decrease it.",
                "Stimulants trigger non-specific immune activity (like Th1), while modulators seek to balance the Th1/Th2/Th17 ratios.",
                "Modulators are only used in acute infections, while stimulants are for chronic disease.",
                "There is no clinical difference; the terms are interchangeable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Immunostimulants (like Echinacea) can trigger pro-inflammatory cytokines that may flare an autoimmune condition, whereas immunomodulators (like Reishi) help regulate the immune response toward homeostasis."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "In the Endocrine Triad (Lesson 4), how does chronic HPA axis activation (high cortisol) typically affect the HPT (Thyroid) axis?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the production of TSH.",
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to T3.",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, reducing T4 to T3 conversion and increasing Reverse T3 (rT3).",
                "It has no measurable effect on thyroid function."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol inhibit the conversion of the inactive T4 hormone into the active T3 hormone, often leading to 'functional hypothyroidism' despite normal TSH levels."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Neuro-inflammation (Lesson 5) is primarily characterized by the over-activation of which resident immune cells in the Central Nervous System?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain. When chronically activated by gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or systemic inflammation, they produce neurotoxic cytokines."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client experiencing a 'Herxheimer Reaction' (Lesson 6) while treating a stealth infection is reacting to:",
            "options": [
                "An allergic reaction to the herbal tincture alcohol base.",
                "The rapid release of endotoxins and debris from dying pathogens that overwhelms clearance pathways.",

                "The primary side effect of Berberine-containing plants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs when the death of bacteria (like Borrelia) releases toxins faster than the body's detoxification organs (liver/kidneys) can eliminate them."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "In Environmental Toxicity (Lesson 7), which Phase II conjugation pathway is most responsible for the detoxification of estrogens and many pharmaceutical drugs?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation is a major Phase II pathway. If this pathway is sluggish (e.g., due to high beta-glucuronidase in the gut), toxins and estrogens can be deconjugated and reabsorbed."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of herbalism in a Palliative Care setting (Lesson 8)?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Palliative care focuses on comfort, dignity, and symptom management rather than curative intent, using gentle nervines, carminatives, and palliatives."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-viral syndromes like Long-COVID often involve endothelial dysfunction and mitochondrial strain; therefore, support should focus on repair and regulation rather than aggressive stimulation."
