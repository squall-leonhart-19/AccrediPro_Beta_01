            "question": "In the H.E.R.B.A.L. clinical interviewing framework, what does the 'B' specifically prompt the clinician to investigate?",
            "options": [
                "Biotics and Biochemistry (medications, supplements, and lab work)",
                "Botanical History (previous experience with herbs)",
                "Biological Rhythms (sleep-wake cycles)",
                "Blood Pressure and Vital Signs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'B' stands for Biotics and Biochemistry, ensuring the clinician reviews current medications, supplements, and any available laboratory data to check for potential herb-drug interactions or physiological imbalances."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a tongue that is pale, swollen, and exhibits distinct 'scalloping' or teeth marks on the lateral edges. This traditionally indicates which tissue state?",
            "options": [
                "Heat and Tissue Irritation",
                "Dampness and Spleen Qi Deficiency",
                "Dryness and Blood Stasis",
                "Wind and Nervous System Exhaustion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A pale, swollen tongue with scalloped edges is a classic indicator of intracellular or extracellular dampness and a deficiency in 'Spleen Qi' (digestive and transformative fire)."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "During pulse assessment, you encounter a 'Wiry' (Chord-like) pulse that feels like a taut guitar string. This quality is most commonly associated with which clinical pattern?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A wiry pulse indicates tension and constriction, typically mapped to Liver Qi stagnation, emotional stress, or the presence of physical pain."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In Constitutional Analysis, a client exhibiting the 'Tense/Constriction' tissue state (characterized by high muscle tone and nervous tension) would most likely require which category of herbs?",
            "options": [
                "Astringents (e.g., Oak Bark)",
                "Antispasmodics and Relaxing Nervines (e.g., Skullcap or Lobelia)",
                "Pungent Stimulants (e.g., Cayenne)",
                "Bitters (e.g., Gentian)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Tense/Constriction state requires herbs that release tension and relax the nervous system or musculature, such as antispasmodics and relaxing nervines."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "When interpreting laboratory results, an herbalist notes a Ferritin level of 22 ng/mL. While within the 'standard' clinical range, why might this be flagged as sub-optimal?",
            "options": [
                "It is too high and indicates iron toxicity",
                "It is optimal for all populations",
                "Optimal levels for hair regrowth and thyroid function are typically between 70-100 ng/mL",
                "Ferritin has no relevance to herbal clinical assessment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical herbalists often use 'optimal' rather than 'standard' ranges; Ferritin below 40-50 ng/mL can contribute to fatigue and hair loss, with 70-100 ng/mL being the target for many practitioners."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During physical inspection, you observe 'Beau’s Lines' (transverse/horizontal ridges) on a client's fingernails. What does this usually signify?",
            "options": [
                "A recent acute fungal infection",
                "A period of severe systemic stress, high fever, or acute illness",

                "Chronic dehydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beau's lines occur when nail growth is temporarily interrupted by severe systemic stress, such as a high fever, surgery, or intense acute illness."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "In an Environmental Assessment, why is the timing of blue light exposure (450-480nm) scrutinized?",
            "options": [
                "It causes immediate permanent retinal damage",
                "It suppresses melatonin production by the pineal gland, disrupting the circadian rhythm",
                "It increases the absorption of Vitamin D",
                "It triggers the release of digestive enzymes prematurely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light exposure in the evening suppresses melatonin secretion, which is critical for sleep-wake cycles and systemic antioxidant activity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MYMOP is a patient-generated outcome measure that tracks the severity of symptoms the patient identifies as most important, making it highly effective for monitoring progress in holistic practice."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with a 'Deep, Weak, and Slow' pulse and a tongue that is 'Pale and Wet.' Which constitutional tissue state is most likely present?",
            "options": [
                "Heat/Excitation",
                "Cold/Depression",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A slow, weak pulse combined with a pale, wet tongue points to the Cold/Depression tissue state, indicating a lack of metabolic fire and vital movement."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "When reviewing a CBC (Complete Blood Count), an RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width) higher than 14.5% may indicate which underlying issue before Hemoglobin drops?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal oxygen carrying capacity",
                "Developing nutrient deficiency (Iron, B12, or Folate) causing variation in cell size",
                "Excessive red blood cell production",
                "Chronic over-hydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated RDW indicates 'anisocytosis' (varying sizes of red blood cells), which is often an early functional marker of nutrient deficiencies (like B12 or Iron) even if the Hemoglobin is still within range."
