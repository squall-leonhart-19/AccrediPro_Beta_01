            "question": "In Lesson 1, the concept of 'Collective Witnessing' is described as a primary mechanism for healing. What is its main psychological effect on group members?",
            "options": [
                "It creates a competitive environment for recovery",
                "It reduces the 'shame-isolation cycle' by normalizing the health struggle through shared experience",
                "It allows the practitioner to work fewer hours for the same pay",
                "It ensures that all members receive the exact same dosage of herbs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collective witnessing validates the individual's experience within a community, breaking the isolation that often accompanies chronic illness and reducing the psychological burden of the 'shame-isolation cycle.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Rooting' phase focuses on the foundational 'why'—the energetics and physiology—ensuring students understand the underlying principles before applying specific herbal remedies."

            "options": [
                "To track the financial profitability of each student",

                "To determine which students should be removed from the program"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Constitutional Matrix allows the clinical herbalist to see the 'shape' of the group, identifying if the majority are Hot/Dry, Cold/Damp, etc., which informs the design of the group's core formula."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Efficiency and clinical efficacy are balanced by using a 70-80% core formula that addresses the shared pathology/theme, with small 'satellite' modifications to handle individual constitutional differences."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical Masterminds leverage the 'collective intelligence' of the group, where practitioners or advanced students analyze cases together, fostering peer-to-peer growth rather than just receiving information from a teacher."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Boundary management requires acknowledging the individual while protecting the group's scope. A 'bridge session' or private referral ensures the individual gets the care they need without derailing the group's educational focus."
