            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme, which accelerates the metabolism of many pharmaceuticals, potentially leading to sub-therapeutic drug levels and treatment failure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In advanced formulation, the Assistant or Harmonizer herb is used to moderate the intensity of the primary herbs and ensure the formula is well-tolerated by the patient's specific constitution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune conditions, the immune system is already hyper-reactive. Immunostimulants can further drive the inflammatory cascade, whereas immunomodulators (like Reishi or Ashwagandha) seek to restore homeostatic balance."
