            "question": "In the context of 'Clinical Architecture,' what is the fundamental difference between a single consultation and a structured clinical program?",
            "options": [
                "A program focuses only on acute symptoms, while consultations focus on chronic issues.",
                "A program provides a predictable container for physiological shifts and behavioral change over a set duration.",
                "Consultations are always more expensive for the client than programs.",
                "Programs exclude the use of individual herbal tinctures in favor of pre-made formulas."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical architecture moves beyond transactional consultations to create a structured timeline (e.g., 3-6 months) that supports deep physiological remodeling and habit formation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Layer 1 focuses on the 'foundational' systems—nervous system (safety) and digestion (nutrient assimilation)—to ensure the body can handle more specific interventions later."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Narrative Synthesis' during a high-complexity clinical intake?",
            "options": [
                "To record every word the client says for legal documentation.",
                "To identify the 'Golden Thread' or the core physiological/emotional pattern connecting disparate symptoms.",
                "To ensure the client talks for at least 90 minutes to feel heard.",
                "To categorize the client into a single standardized diagnostic code."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative Synthesis is the process of distilling complex data into a coherent story that identifies the root pattern (the Golden Thread) driving the client's health state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trophorestoratives (like Milky Oats for the nervous system or Hawthorn for the heart) are used to restore the integrity and function of exhausted tissues."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Herbalists use labs as 'biological data points' to track trends and refine herbal protocols, staying within scope by not diagnosing or treating diseases."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "In 'Protocol Sequencing,' why is 'Clearing' (Phase 1) usually performed before 'Tonifying' (Phase 2)?",
            "options": [
                "Because tonics are too expensive to use early in a program.",
                "To ensure metabolic pathways are open and inflammation is reduced before stimulating tissue growth or energy production.",
                "Because clearing herbs always taste better than tonifying herbs.",
                "To ensure the client loses weight before starting the rebuilding phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sequencing ensures that the body's 'exits' are open (detoxification/elimination) so that when tonification increases metabolic activity, waste products don't accumulate."

                "It eliminates the need for any 1-on-1 interaction with the herbalist.",
                "Group programs are the only way to legally recommend herbs in some states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Contagion in a clinical setting refers to the phenomenon where health-promoting behaviors spread through a group, increasing individual compliance and success."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing, adjusting, or advising the discontinuation of pharmaceutical medications is strictly outside the scope of practice for a clinical herbalist and is a major ethical violation."

            "question": "During a 'Clinical Follow-up,' a client reports a 'flare' of symptoms after starting a new formula. What is the most appropriate first step in 'Protocol Evolution'?",

                "Tell the client to double the dose to 'push through' the reaction.",
                "Immediately discontinue all herbs and refer the client to the ER.",
                "Assess if the reaction is a 'healing crisis' (clearance) or true intolerance, and consider adding 'drainage' support.",
                "Ignore the flare and wait another month to see if it resolves on its own."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protocol evolution requires distinguishing between a therapeutic reaction (needing better drainage) and an adverse reaction (needing formula adjustment)."
