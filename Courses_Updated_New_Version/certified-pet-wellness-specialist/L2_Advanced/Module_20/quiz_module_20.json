            "options": [
                "A pet can have a high Body Condition Score (BCS) but a low Muscle Condition Score (MCS).",
                "MCS is only relevant for senior pets experiencing sarcopenia.",
                "MCS is determined solely by weighing the pet on a digital scale.",
                "A score of 1 on the MCS scale indicates 'Ideal' muscle mass."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "MCS assesses muscle mass independently of fat. Sarcopenic obesity is common, where a pet is overweight (high BCS) but has significant muscle wasting (low MCS)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratios (above 10:1) are associated with pro-inflammatory pathways. The goal for wellness is often closer to 4:1 or lower."

            "explanation": "Functional interpretation looks at the 'well' range within the broader reference range to identify sub-clinical shifts toward dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A decrease in HRV indicates reduced autonomic flexibility and is typically a marker of increased stress, pain, or overtraining."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Creatinine can be falsely low in pets with muscle wasting (sarcopenia). SDMA is independent of muscle mass and can detect kidney function loss as early as 25-40%."
