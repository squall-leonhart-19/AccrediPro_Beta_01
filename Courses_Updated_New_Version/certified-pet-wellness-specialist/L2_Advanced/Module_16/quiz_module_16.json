            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first 3 days are characterized by decompression, where the dog is often overwhelmed, has high cortisol levels, and may not show their true personality."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In chronic dermatological cases, what is the primary reason that 'flare-ups' occur even when a known food allergen has been removed from the diet?",
            "options": [
                "The dog has developed an immediate immunity to the new food",
                "The 'Itch-Scratch Cycle' has caused a breakdown in the skin barrier, allowing environmental allergens to penetrate",
                "Food allergies only account for 5% of skin cases",
                "The dog is likely reacting to the plastic bowl rather than the food"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic scratching damages the stratum corneum (skin barrier), leading to trans-epidermal water loss and increased penetration of environmental allergens (Atopy)."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "For a high-performance working dog (e.g., Search and Rescue), what is the physiological benefit of 'fat-loading' or a high-fat diet?",
            "options": [
                "It prevents the dog from getting too distracted by scents",
                "It increases the glycogen storage in the liver by 500%",
                "It promotes 'metabolic conditioning,' allowing the body to burn fat more efficiently and spare glucose for the brain",
                "It helps the dog maintain a waterproof coat for swimming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-fat diets for working dogs increase mitochondrial density and allow for 'fat-adaptation,' which provides a more sustained energy source and spares limited glycogen stores."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "When managing post-surgical recovery for a cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) repair, what is the 'Golden Window' to begin passive range of motion (PROM) to prevent joint fibrosis?",
            "options": [
                "14 days post-op (after suture removal)",
                "24 to 72 hours post-op (if pain is managed)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early mobilization (within 24-72 hours) through gentle PROM and controlled walking is critical to prevent muscle atrophy and joint stiffness, provided pain is adequately controlled."

                "Approximately 15%",
                "Exactly 50%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that up to 80% of dogs with behavioral issues, particularly sudden-onset aggression or irritability, have an undiagnosed painful condition like Osteoarthritis."

                "Arachidonic Acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHA is a primary structural component of the brain; supplementation helps reduce oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation associated with cognitive decline."

            "question": "A feline patient with concurrent Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) presents a nutritional challenge because:",
            "options": [
                "Diabetes requires high fiber, while CKD requires low fiber",
                "Diabetes requires high protein/low carb, while CKD requires protein restriction and phosphorus control",
                "Cats with CKD cannot digest carbohydrates at all",
                "Insulin cannot be administered to cats with kidney issues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This is a classic 'competing pathology' case where the high-protein requirement for diabetic remission conflicts with the need to limit phosphorus and protein by-products in CKD."
