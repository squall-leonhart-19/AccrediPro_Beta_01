            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Advanced Treatment Planning,' what is the primary purpose of the 'Stabilization Phase' before moving to 'Optimization'?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce the financial burden on the client by delaying expensive supplements",
                "To address acute physiological stressors and pain that would otherwise interfere with long-term metabolic healing",
                "To test the client's compliance levels before committing to a full-year protocol",
                "To allow the pet's microbiome to reset naturally without any external intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stabilization Phase is critical for removing immediate barriers to healing, such as uncontrolled pain or acute inflammation, ensuring the body is receptive to long-term optimization strategies."

            "question": "When developing a Bio-Individual Nutritional Strategy for a pet with chronic inflammation, which 'Omega-3 to Omega-6' ratio is generally targeted in professional protocols?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While standard commercial diets often have ratios of 1:20 or higher, therapeutic bio-individual plans target a much tighter ratio (1:1 to 1:2) to shift the eicosanoid balance toward anti-inflammatory pathways."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Felines are sensitive to high-frequency sounds (ultrasonic) that humans cannot hear; these 'silent' environmental stressors can keep a pet in a state of chronic sympathetic nervous system arousal."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a vast majority of sudden behavioral changes in adult pets are rooted in physical discomfort or pain, requiring a medical intervention before behavioral modification."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators (like HRV or daily activity levels) provide real-time data that can predict health changes before they manifest as clinical 'lagging' results like bloodwork changes or weight loss."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
