            "options": [
                "Linear diagnosis focuses on a single symptom, while systems-thinking identifies the interconnected 'root drivers' across multiple biological systems.",
                "Systems-thinking is only used for physical ailments, while linear diagnosis is used for behavioral issues.",
                "Linear diagnosis requires veterinary oversight, whereas systems-thinking is purely for wellness coaches.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in professional practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Systems-thinking views the pet as a whole, identifying how a breakdown in one area (e.g., gut health) may be the root driver for another (e.g., skin issues or anxiety)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-habit stacking (e.g., performing a 2-minute mobility stretch immediately after the morning walk) significantly improves long-term adherence by leveraging existing neural pathways."

            "options": [
                "Because it requires the client to spend the most money.",
                "Because it works passively 24/7 to reduce the pet's total allostatic load (stress) without requiring active training.",
                "Because it only benefits the pet's physical health, not their behavior.",
                "Because it replaces the need for high-quality nutrition."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Optimizing the habitat (lighting, air quality, toxin reduction) provides a constant, passive benefit that lowers the pet's overall stress burden, making all other interventions more effective."
