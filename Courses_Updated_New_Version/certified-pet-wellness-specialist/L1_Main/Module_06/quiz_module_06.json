            "question": "In the 'S' Pillar Framework of Sustained Vitality, what is the primary distinction between 'Stability' and 'Stewardship'?",
            "options": [
                "Stability refers to maintaining the pet's homeostatic baseline, while Stewardship involves the specialist's role in managing the pet parent's compliance and education.",
                "Stability is the collection of data, while Stewardship is the analysis of that data by a veterinarian.",
                "Stability refers to the pet's physical environment, while Stewardship refers to the nutritional protocol only.",
                "Stability is a short-term goal, while Stewardship is a long-term goal for geriatric pets only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stability focuses on keeping the biological systems in a state of equilibrium (homeostasis), whereas Stewardship is the active management and ethical guidance provided by the specialist to ensure the plan is executed correctly."

            "question": "A 2022 study highlighted in the module suggests that SDMA (Symmetric Dimethylarginine) can detect declining kidney function much earlier than Creatinine. At what percentage of functional loss does SDMA typically rise?",
            "options": [
                "75% loss of kidney function",
                "50% loss of kidney function",
                "25% to 40% loss of kidney function",
                "10% to 15% loss of kidney function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SDMA is a more sensitive biomarker than Creatinine, rising when there is as little as 25-40% loss of kidney function, whereas Creatinine often remains normal until 75% of function is gone."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "When performing an at-home physical assessment, a Capillary Refill Time (CRT) of 2.5 seconds in a resting dog should be interpreted as:",
            "options": [
                "Optimal cardiovascular health and hydration.",
                "A normal variation for brachycephalic breeds.",
                "A delayed response indicating potential dehydration or poor peripheral perfusion.",
                "An emergency situation requiring immediate CPR."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A normal CRT is under 2 seconds. A CRT of 2.5 seconds is considered delayed and is a clinical indicator of decreased tissue perfusion, often caused by dehydration or low cardiac output."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which behavioral biometric is most indicative of 'Sickness Behavior' mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines rather than simple cognitive decline?",
            "options": [
                "Increased vocalization during the night.",
                "Anhedonia (loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities like play or greeting).",
                "Forgetting basic commands that were previously mastered.",
                "Pacing in circles in the living room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anhedonia, along with lethargy and reduced social interaction, is a hallmark of 'Sickness Behavior,' which is an evolutionary adaptation triggered by the immune system's cytokine response to inflammation or infection."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "During an Environmental Stress Audit, the Specialist identifies 'Micro-Stressors.' Which of the following is a statistically significant micro-stressor for indoor cats that often goes unnoticed by owners?",
            "options": [
                "High-frequency sounds (10-60 kHz) from electronic appliances.",
                "The color of the walls in the primary living area.",
                "The presence of a television being left on at low volume.",
                "Using a plastic water bowl instead of a ceramic one."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cats have a hearing range that extends into the ultrasonic (up to 64 kHz). Electronic 'coil whine' or high-frequency sounds from appliances can be a source of chronic, invisible stress that elevates baseline cortisol."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "When analyzing data from a wearable biometric device, a consistent decrease in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) over a 14-day period most likely suggests:",
            "options": [
                "The pet's fitness level is improving significantly.",
                "The pet is entering a state of deep relaxation and recovery.",
                "The autonomic nervous system is under stress, indicating poor recovery or impending illness.",
                "The device's battery is low and providing inaccurate readings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates a flexible, resilient autonomic nervous system. A consistent decrease in HRV suggests the sympathetic nervous system ('fight or flight') is dominant, signaling stress, pain, or lack of systemic recovery."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "In the 'Pivoting the Plan' protocol, what is the 'Rule of Three' used to determine if a major roadmap adjustment is necessary?",
            "options": [
                "Three different family members must agree on the change.",
                "The pet must show symptoms for at least three consecutive weeks.",
                "Three or more independent data points (e.g., weight, a biomarker, and behavior) must show a negative trend.",
                "The specialist must consult three different veterinarians before suggesting a pivot."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of Three' ensures that we aren't reacting to an isolated 'blip' in data. When three independent metrics trend negatively, it provides high confidence that the current wellness plan needs a strategic pivot."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "When using the 'Data Sandwich' technique for client communication, how should the Specialist structure the conversation about a pet's declining mobility?",
            "options": [
                "Present the bad news first, then the data, then the cost of the new plan.",
                "Start with a positive trend (e.g., stable weight), present the mobility decline data, and conclude with the actionable solution.",
                "Present all the negative data at once to ensure the client understands the gravity of the situation.",
                "Avoid mentioning the decline and focus only on the positive aspects of the pet's health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Data Sandwich' (Positive - Challenge - Action) builds trust and reduces client defensiveness, making them more likely to adhere to the recommended adjustments."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Why is monitoring the Muscle Condition Score (MCS) considered more vital than the Body Condition Score (BCS) in aging pets?",
            "options": [
                "BCS is impossible to measure in long-haired breeds.",
                "MCS measures fat mass, which is the primary driver of inflammation.",
                "Pets can maintain a 'normal' BCS while suffering from significant sarcopenia (muscle wasting), which correlates with higher mortality.",
                "MCS is the only metric that can be measured without physically touching the pet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarcopenia (loss of lean muscle) is a major predictor of morbidity in seniors. A pet can appear to have a healthy weight (BCS) but have dangerously low muscle mass (MCS), which requires different nutritional and exercise interventions."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "A Specialist notices a canine client's resting respiratory rate (RRR) has trended from 18 breaths per minute to 26 breaths per minute over three weeks. What is the most appropriate action according to the module's guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the pet's cardiovascular exercise to improve lung capacity.",
                "Advise the owner to monitor for another month to see if it reaches 30 bpm.",
                "Flag this as a significant deviation and recommend a veterinary evaluation for potential cardiac or pulmonary issues.",
                "Suggest changing the pet's diet to a low-calorie formula to reduce pressure on the diaphragm."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 26 bpm is still within the 'normal' range for some dogs, the *trend* (an increase of nearly 50% from the pet's baseline) is a red flag for early-stage congestive heart failure or respiratory distress and requires professional medical screening."
