            "question": "Why are cats significantly more susceptible to essential oil toxicity than dogs, as discussed in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "They have a higher metabolic rate that processes oils too quickly",
                "They lack the necessary glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes in the liver for proper detoxification",
                "Their skin is thicker, preventing the oils from being absorbed effectively",
                "They have fewer olfactory receptors, leading them to ingest more oil"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats lack specific UGT enzymes required for the glucuronidation pathway, making it difficult for their livers to metabolize and eliminate the phenols and terpenes found in many essential oils."
