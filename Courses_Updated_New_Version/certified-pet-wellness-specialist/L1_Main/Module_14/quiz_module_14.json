            "question": "According to the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) lesson, why are cats and small dogs more susceptible to Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from floor cleaners and aerosol sprays?",
            "options": [
                "They have a higher metabolic rate than humans",
                "They spend more time near the floor where heavy vapors settle",
                "They possess more olfactory receptors which increases absorption",
                "Their skin is thinner and absorbs chemicals faster"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many VOCs and chemical vapors are heavier than air and settle near the ground. Because pets live closer to the floor and have higher respiratory rates relative to their size, they inhale a higher concentration of these pollutants."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Which specific liver enzyme deficiency makes cats particularly vulnerable to toxicity from certain essential oils (like tea tree or peppermint)?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Glucuronosyltransferase",
                "Cytochrome P450",
                "Alanine Aminotransferase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats lack the liver enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, which is required for the glucuronidation pathway. This makes them unable to effectively metabolize phenols and monoterpene hydrocarbons found in many essential oils."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In the context of Seasonal Wellness, the '80/80 Rule' suggests that pets are at significant risk of heat exhaustion when:",
            "options": [
                "The temperature is 80°F and the pet is over 80 lbs",
                "The temperature is 80°F and the humidity is 80%",
                "The heart rate exceeds 80 bpm for 80 minutes",
                "The humidity is 80% and the pet's age is over 8 years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/80 rule states that when the ambient temperature is 80°F and the relative humidity is 80%, the 'heat index' makes it difficult for pets (especially brachycephalic breeds) to cool themselves through panting."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "When implementing a Travel Stress Mitigation plan, how long before departure should synthetic pheromones (like Feliway or Adaptil) be applied to a carrier?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately before placing the pet inside",
                "At least 15–20 minutes prior to allow the alcohol carrier to evaporate",
                "2 hours prior to ensure full saturation",
                "24 hours prior to allow the scent to stabilize"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pheromone sprays use an alcohol base. If a pet is placed in the carrier immediately, the strong smell of alcohol can be aversive. Waiting 15–20 minutes allows the alcohol to evaporate, leaving the soothing pheromones behind."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "To minimize resource guarding and social tension in a multi-cat household, what is the recommended 'N+1 Rule' for essential resources?",
            "options": [
                "One resource for every pet plus one extra",
                "One resource for every two pets",
                "One resource per room plus one per pet",
                "One resource for every pet minus one to encourage sharing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'N+1 Rule' (where N is the number of pets) ensures that there is always an available resource (litter box, water bowl, or bed) even if one is being guarded or occupied by another pet."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "During an emergency triage, what do 'brick red' or 'bright purple' mucous membranes typically indicate in a dog or cat?",
            "options": [
                "Normal, healthy oxygenation",
                "Anemia or severe blood loss",
                "Heatstroke, sepsis, or carbon monoxide poisoning",
                "Liver failure or jaundice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While pale gums indicate blood loss or shock, bright red or 'injected' mucous membranes are a sign of hyperthermia (heatstroke), systemic infection (sepsis), or toxic inhalation."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In Integrated Pest Management (IPM), what percentage of a flea population typically exists as 'adults' on the pet at any given time?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5%",

                "Approximately 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Only about 5% of a flea population consists of adults on the pet. The remaining 95% exists in the environment as eggs, larvae, and pupae, which is why environmental treatment is critical."

            "options": [
                "To check for dust and allergens on top of high furniture",
                "To identify hazards from the height and perspective of the pet",
                "To assess the aesthetic appeal of the pet's living space",
                "To measure the light levels for circadian rhythm regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Pet's Eye View' audit involves getting down on hands and knees to identify hidden hazards like loose wires, small swallowable objects, or chemical residues that are not visible from a human standing height."

            "options": [
                "Kidney failure and respiratory distress",
                "Severe hypoglycemia and acute hepatic (liver) necrosis",
                "Cardiac arrest and intestinal blockage",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xylitol causes a rapid, massive insulin release in dogs leading to life-threatening hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), followed by potential acute liver failure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A normal resting heart rate for an adult dog is typically between 70–120 bpm, though smaller dogs and puppies may have higher rates (up to 160 bpm)."
