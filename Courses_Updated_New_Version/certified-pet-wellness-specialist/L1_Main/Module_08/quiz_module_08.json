            "question": "According to the principles of Sustained Vitality (L1), what is the primary reason for increasing wellness screening frequency to every six months for senior pets?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the revenue generated per client per year",
                "Because physiological changes in seniors occur approximately 5-7 times faster than in humans",
                "To satisfy insurance requirements for geriatric coverage",
                "To ensure the pet is receiving adequate socialization with clinic staff"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because pets age significantly faster than humans, a six-month gap in a senior pet is equivalent to several years of human aging, making frequent monitoring essential for early disease detection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Contrary to old myths about protein and kidney health, healthy seniors actually require high-quality protein to maintain lean muscle mass and prevent sarcopenia (muscle wasting)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "On a 9-point scale, each point above the ideal (5) represents approximately 10-15% excess body weight; therefore, a 7/9 is roughly 20-30% overweight."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the P.A.W.S. method, physical causes (pain or disease) must be ruled out first; a senior cat may soil outside the box because it is too painful to climb into a high-sided litter box."
