            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Profiling' phase within the P.A.W.S. Method™?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose specific medical conditions that require immediate surgery",
                "To create a comprehensive biological and environmental baseline before intervention",
                "To sell specific nutritional supplements based on breed standards",
                "To replace the need for professional veterinary diagnostics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Profiling is about establishing a 'holistic baseline'—understanding the pet's current state across physical, nutritional, environmental, and behavioral domains before any wellness strategy is implemented."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During a physical assessment (L2), you observe a Capillary Refill Time (CRT) of 3.5 seconds. What is the most likely clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "Normal cardiovascular function and hydration",
                "Excellent peripheral perfusion and high oxygenation",
                "Potential dehydration, poor perfusion, or low blood pressure",
                "The pet is in a state of 'hyper-excitement' or high stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A normal CRT is under 2 seconds. A delayed CRT (over 2-3 seconds) suggests that blood is not returning to the capillaries quickly, often due to dehydration or cardiovascular compromise."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A 20kg neutered adult dog has a calculated Resting Energy Requirement (RER) of approximately 662 calories. If the owner provides 200 calories in treats daily, what percentage of the 'Caloric Drift' does this represent?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 20%",
                "Approximately 30%",
                "Approximately 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "200 divided by 662 is approximately 30.2%. This 'Caloric Drift' significantly exceeds the recommended 10% limit for treats and can lead to nutrient imbalances."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Environmental Stressors), which of the following is identified as a significant source of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that contribute to a pet's 'Toxic Load'?",
            "options": [
                "Stainless steel water bowls",
                "Filtered tap water",
                "Synthetic fragrances and 'plug-in' air fresheners",
                "Organic cotton pet bedding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthetic fragrances and air fresheners are major contributors to indoor air pollution and VOC levels, which pets are particularly sensitive to due to their proximity to the floor and higher respiratory rates."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A cat presents for assessment showing 'whale eye,' frequent lip licking, and a crouched posture with the tail tucked tightly. According to the FAS (Fear, Anxiety, and Stress) scale, which level is this pet likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "FAS 0 (Relaxed)",
                "FAS 1 (Mild)",
                "FAS 3 (Moderate)",
                "FAS 5 (Severe/Aggressive)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FAS 3 involves clear physiological signs of distress (lip licking, whale eye, avoidant posture) without the pet yet resorting to overt aggression (FAS 5) or complete freezing."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When conducting a Medical History Review (L6), why is the 'Chronicity' of a symptom more important than the symptom itself for a Wellness Specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Chronicity determines the cost of the veterinary insurance claim",
                "It helps distinguish between an acute incident and a systemic wellness failure",
                "Chronic symptoms are always easier to fix than acute ones",
                "It allows the specialist to prescribe stronger medications"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding if a symptom is chronic (long-term/recurring) versus acute (sudden) helps the specialist identify if the issue is rooted in lifestyle, environment, or a deeper systemic imbalance."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "During the Functional Mobility Assessment (L7), you observe a dog 'bunny hopping' (moving both hind legs together) while running. This is a classic compensatory sign of:",
            "options": [
                "Excellent core strength and athletic ability",
                "Neurological high-stepping (ataxia)",
                "Reduced range of motion in the hips or pelvic discomfort",
                "A behavioral habit with no physical significance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bunny hopping is a common compensatory gait used by dogs to minimize the individual range of motion required in each hip joint, often indicating hip dysplasia or arthritis."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "The 'Preventive Care Gap' refers to which common finding during a Medical Audit?",
            "options": [
                "The time between a pet's birth and their first vaccine",
                "The discrepancy between recommended wellness screenings and the actual care received",
                "The distance a client has to travel to reach a specialist clinic",
                "The difference in price between generic and brand-name medications"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Preventive Care Gap identifies areas where standard wellness protocols (like annual bloodwork or dental checks) have been missed, creating 'blind spots' in the pet's health profile."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which of these is a critical distinction between Body Condition Score (BCS) and Muscle Condition Score (MCS)?",
            "options": [
                "BCS measures fat cover, while MCS evaluates lean muscle mass independently of fat",
                "BCS is only for dogs, while MCS is only for cats",
                "MCS can only be assessed by a veterinarian using X-rays",
                "A pet with a high BCS (overweight) cannot have a low MCS (muscle wasting)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "It is possible for an overweight pet (high BCS) to have significant muscle wasting (low MCS), especially in cases of chronic illness or aging (sarcopenia). Both must be assessed independently."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of synthesizing all data into the 'PAWS Wellness Scorecard' (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a legal document for insurance purposes",
                "To calculate the exact date of the pet's next vaccination",
                "To identify 'High-Impact Levers'—the 20% of changes that will yield 80% of the wellness results",
                "To rank the pet against other clients in the practice for marketing purposes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data synthesis allows the specialist to look at the 'big picture' and identify the specific interventions (High-Impact Levers) that will most effectively improve the pet's quality of life."
