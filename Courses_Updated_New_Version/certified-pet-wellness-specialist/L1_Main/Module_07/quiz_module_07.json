            "question": "According to the Biological Blueprint (L1), which physiological feature most distinguishes the canine digestive tract from omnivores like humans?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of salivary amylase to begin carbohydrate breakdown",
                "A highly acidic stomach pH (1-2) designed to neutralize pathogens and digest bone",
                "A long, complex colon designed for extensive microbial fermentation of fiber",
                "The ability to synthesize Vitamin C in the liver without dietary intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike omnivores, dogs and cats maintain a very low gastric pH (1-2) when consuming a species-appropriate diet, which is essential for protein denaturation and pathogen defense."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In the context of Nutritional Bioavailability (L2), how does the 'Extrusion Process' typically affect the nutrient density of commercial kibble?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the bioavailability of heat-sensitive vitamins like Thiamine (B1)",
                "It creates Maillard reaction products which can promote systemic inflammation",
                "It eliminates the need for synthetic vitamin premixes",
                "It reduces the glycemic index of the starches used as binders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-heat extrusion creates Maillard reaction products (Advanced Glycation End-products), which are linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, while often destroying up to 50-70% of heat-sensitive vitamins."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A 2023 study referenced in L3 found that house-bound pets often have higher levels of PBDEs (flame retardants) than their owners. What is the primary reason for this?",
            "options": [
                "Pets have a higher metabolic rate that attracts dust particles",
                "Pets spend 90% of their time near the floor where heavy toxins settle in 'micro-climates'",
                "Pets lack the liver enzymes necessary to process any synthetic chemicals",
                "Pet food packaging is the only source of PBDE exposure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pets live in the 'breathing zone' of the floor, where heavy toxins like phthalates, PBDEs from carpets/furniture, and cleaning residues settle into concentrated micro-climates."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Regarding Circadian Rhythms (L4), what is the physiological consequence of exposing a dog to high-intensity blue light (LEDs/Screens) late in the evening?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the pineal gland to overproduce melatonin",
                "It suppresses melatonin secretion, delaying the shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance",
                "It has no effect because dogs lack the specific retinal receptors for blue light",
                "It increases the core body temperature, leading to 'night panting'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light exposure inhibits the pineal gland's production of melatonin, preventing the body from entering the deep restorative sleep phases necessary for cellular repair."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "The 'Gut-Brain-Skin Axis' (L5) suggests that which percentage of a pet's immune system is located within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25-30%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 70-80%",
                "Nearly 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that 70-80% of the immune system resides in the gut, meaning microbiome dysbiosis is frequently the root cause of chronic skin allergies and behavioral anxiety."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In L6 (Cognitive Enrichment), the term 'Neuroplasticity' refers to the brain's ability to:",
            "options": [
                "Remain static once a pet reaches social maturity",
                "Reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life in response to environmental stimuli",

                "Store an infinite amount of short-term memory without sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity allows the brain to change and adapt. Cognitive enrichment (novel scents, puzzles, training) stimulates BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) to support this process even in senior pets."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "According to Stress Physiology (L7), what is the primary danger of 'Chronic Cortisol Elevation' in a pet?",
            "options": [
                "It leads to a permanent increase in muscle mass",
                "It causes the thymus gland to shrink and suppresses T-cell production, weakening the immune response",
                "It increases the bioavailability of dietary protein",
                "It causes an immediate drop in blood glucose levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While acute cortisol is life-saving, chronic elevation is immunosuppressive, shrinking the thymus and making the pet more susceptible to infections and slow healing."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "When implementing the Sustained Vitality Protocol (L8), which 'Longitudinal Marker' provides the best insight into systemic inflammation over time?",
            "options": [
                "Body Weight",
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP) or Albumin/Globulin (A/G) Ratio",
                "Number of calories consumed per day",
                "The frequency of professional grooming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal tracking focuses on internal biomarkers. Trends in CRP or changes in the A/G ratio are critical indicators of 'inflammaging' and internal health shifts before clinical symptoms appear."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Practical Application: A client's dog has chronic 'yeasty' ears and paws. Based on Module 7's focus on the Microbiome (L5), what should be the first area of investigation?",
            "options": [
                "Applying topical steroids to the ears immediately",
                "Checking for intestinal dysbiosis and high-starch intake that feeds fungal overgrowth",
                "Increasing the frequency of bathing with scented shampoos",
                "Restricting the dog's water intake to reduce moisture"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yeasty ears and paws are often outward manifestations of 'Leaky Gut' and microbiome imbalance, frequently fueled by high-glycemic carbohydrates in the diet."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Practical Application: To optimize a pet's 'Home Detox' (L3), which of the following is the most effective high-impact change a specialist can recommend?",
            "options": [
                "Switching to 'unscented' versions of the same chemical cleaners",
                "Using a HEPA-certified air purifier and removing synthetic 'plug-in' fragrances",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HEPA filtration removes the toxic dust pets inhale near the floor, and removing synthetic fragrances eliminates VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) that stress the pet's liver and respiratory system."
