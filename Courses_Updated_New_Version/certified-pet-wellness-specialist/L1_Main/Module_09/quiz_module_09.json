            "question": "Which cellular phenomenon is characterized by the accumulation of non-dividing cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the 'inflammaging' process in senior pets?",
            "options": [
                "Apoptosis",
                "Cellular Senescence",

                "Telomere Elongation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cellular senescence occurs when cells stop dividing but remain metabolically active, secreting a 'Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype' (SASP) that promotes chronic, low-grade inflammation (inflammaging)."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In the PAWS framework for senior wellness, what is the primary focus of the 'P' (Profiling) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing pharmaceutical interventions",
                "Establishing a baseline through comprehensive diagnostics and behavioral history",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'P' in PAWS stands for Profiling, which involves deep-dive assessments, including bloodwork, urinalysis, and behavioral screening to establish a geriatric baseline."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A common misconception in geriatric nutrition is that all senior dogs should be on a low-protein diet. According to current research, what is the actual protein requirement for healthy aging dogs?",
            "options": [
                "Protein should be restricted to below 15% to protect the kidneys.",
                "Seniors require lower protein because their metabolism slows down.",
                "Healthy seniors often require increased protein (up to 25% more) to prevent sarcopenia.",
                "Protein quality is irrelevant as long as the calorie count is low."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unless advanced renal disease is present, healthy senior dogs actually require higher-quality protein to maintain lean muscle mass and prevent sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SDMA (Symmetric Dimethylarginine) and a decrease in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine (Lower USG) typically appear well before creatinine levels rise outside of reference ranges."

            "options": [
                "It is a sign of high energy and vitality.",
                "It is a compensatory gait often indicating hip dysplasia or osteoarthritis pain.",
                "It is a behavioral trait associated with cognitive decline.",
                "It is a normal neurological reflex in dogs over 10 years old."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bunny hopping (using both hind legs together) is a classic compensatory movement used to minimize the weight-bearing load on individual painful joints, usually indicating OA or hip issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scent mapping uses the pet's olfactory strengths to compensate for vision loss, helping them navigate 'zones' in the house safely."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because aging occurs more rapidly in pets, bi-annual (every 6 months) exams are the gold standard for early detection of age-related pathologies."

            "question": "Case Study: 'Max,' a 13-year-old Beagle, is restless at night, staring at walls, and has had several indoor accidents despite being walked. What is the most appropriate first step for a Wellness Specialist?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In senior pets, behavioral changes often have underlying medical causes (like a UTI causing accidents or OA pain causing restlessness). Medical clearance is always the first step before assuming it is purely cognitive."
