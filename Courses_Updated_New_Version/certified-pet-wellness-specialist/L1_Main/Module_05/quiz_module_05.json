            "options": [
                "To establish a baseline of physical, behavioral, and environmental data before intervention",
                "To prescribe a specific brand of therapeutic pet food",
                "To perform emergency medical procedures on an injured animal",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Profiling is the foundational step used to gather comprehensive data on physical health markers and behavioral history to inform the rest of the P.A.W.S. plan."

            "question": "When evaluating physical health markers, how does Muscle Condition Score (MCS) differ from Body Condition Score (BCS)?",
            "options": [
                "MCS measures fat accumulation, while BCS measures bone density",
                "BCS evaluates fat cover, while MCS specifically assesses muscle mass over bony prominences",
                "MCS is only used for cats, while BCS is only used for dogs",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable in clinical settings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BCS assesses body fat, but MCS is critical for identifying sarcopenia (muscle wasting), which can occur even in overweight pets."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trigger stacking occurs when multiple stressors (even minor ones) happen in close succession, leading to a reactive outburst because the animal's stress hormones haven't returned to baseline."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Biological appropriateness is defined by how well the nutrient profile matches the species' evolutionary needs and how easily those nutrients are absorbed."

                "It allows cats to go up to two weeks without any fluid intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats have a low thirst drive; they are biologically designed to obtain the majority of their hydration through their diet (prey is typically 70-75% water)."
