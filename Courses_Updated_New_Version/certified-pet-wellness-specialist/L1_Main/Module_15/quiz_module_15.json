            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "According to the biological foundations discussed in Lesson 1, approximately what percentage of a pet's immune system is housed within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": ["30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%", "90-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 70-80% of the immune system resides in the GALT, making the gut the primary driver of systemic immune health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "When reviewing a microbiome profile in Lesson 2, an overrepresentation of which phylum is most frequently associated with acute inflammation and metabolic endotoxemia?",
            "options": ["Bacteroidetes", "Proteobacteria", "Firmicutes", "Actinobacteria"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The phylum Proteobacteria contains many pathogens (like E. coli); high levels are a 'red flag' for dysbiosis and systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In the context of nutritional modulation (Lesson 3), what is the primary byproduct of microbial fermentation of soluble fiber that serves as the main energy source for colonocytes?",
            "options": ["Lactate", "Ammonia", "Butyrate", "Propionate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is a Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) that provides up to 70% of the energy needed by the cells lining the colon (colonocytes)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the Gut-Brain Axis. Which physical structure serves as the primary 'superhighway' for bi-directional communication between the enteric nervous system and the brain?",
            "options": ["The Vagus Nerve", "The Sciatic Nerve", "The Spinal Cord", "The Trigeminal Nerve"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Vagus Nerve (Cranial Nerve X) provides the direct physical link for the bidirectional flow of information between the gut and the brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Based on the environmental influences discussed in Lesson 5, what is the 'Old Friends Hypothesis' primarily concerned with?",
            "options": ["The benefits of multi-pet households for social behavior", "The loss of ancestral microbial exposure leading to increased autoimmune and allergic diseases", "The impact of senior pets on the microbiome of younger puppies", "The relationship between soil quality and canine longevity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Old Friends Hypothesis suggests that a lack of exposure to diverse, ancestral microbes in modern, sterile environments leads to immune system dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "According to the ISAPP definitions in Lesson 6, what distinguishes a 'Postbiotic' from a 'Probiotic'?",
            "options": ["Postbiotics must be live organisms, whereas probiotics are dead", "Postbiotics are the fiber sources that feed the bacteria", "Postbiotics are inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confer a health benefit", "Postbiotics only function in the small intestine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postbiotics are non-living (inanimate) microbial cells or cell fragments that still provide a physiological benefit to the host."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "In the Lesson 7 case study regarding 'Cooper' (the anxious Lab with chronic loose stools), which intervention was most critical for shifting his behavior via the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["High-dose sedative medication", "Increasing insoluble fiber to 15% of the diet", "Introduction of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) and prebiotic chicory root", "Transitioning to a 100% raw meat diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific strains like L. rhamnosus have been shown to modulate GABA receptors and reduce stress markers when paired with appropriate prebiotic fuel."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes long-term monitoring. What is considered the most practical, daily 'biomarker' a pet owner can use to assess gut health?",
            "options": ["Body condition score", "The Bristol Stool Scale (or equivalent fecal consistency score)", "Breath odor analysis", "Daily water intake volume"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fecal consistency and quality are immediate, non-invasive indicators of the state of the microbiome and digestive efficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A pet presents with high levels of 'Kynurenine' in a metabolic screen. According to Lesson 4, this suggests that Tryptophan is being diverted away from the production of which neurotransmitter?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Serotonin", "Acetylcholine", "Epinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the gut is inflamed, the 'Kynurenine Pathway' is activated, stealing Tryptophan away from Serotonin production, often leading to anxiety and depression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Alpha Diversity' metric used for in microbiome profiling (Lesson 2)?",
            "options": ["Measuring the number of different species and their distribution within a single sample", "Comparing the microbiome of a dog to that of a cat", "Determining the ratio of protein to fat in the diet", "Identifying the single most dominant 'Alpha' bacteria in the gut"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Alpha diversity measures the richness (number of species) and evenness (distribution) within an individual's microbiome; higher alpha diversity is generally a marker of health."
