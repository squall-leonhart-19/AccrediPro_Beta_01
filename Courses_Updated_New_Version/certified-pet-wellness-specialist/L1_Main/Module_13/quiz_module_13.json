            "question": "During a 'Knee-High' Environmental Audit, why are Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (Quats) considered particularly hazardous to cats even after surfaces appear dry?",
            "options": [
                "They emit high levels of radiation for 48 hours",
                "Cats groom their paws, leading to oral ingestion and corrosive esophageal damage",
                "Quats react with feline fur to produce toxic chlorine gas",
                "They lose all efficacy once dry, making them a waste of money"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (found in many disinfectants) are cationic detergents. Cats are at high risk because they walk on treated surfaces and then groom themselves, leading to oral ulcers, stomatitis, and esophageal burns."

            "question": "A client's cat has ingested a small amount of pollen from a 'Stargazer' Lily (Lilium orientalis). What is the critical window for intervention before irreversible damage occurs?",
            "options": [
                "Intervention is only needed if the cat eats the entire bulb",
                "Within 12-18 hours, as acute kidney injury (AKI) can occur rapidly",
                "Intervention is not needed; lilies only cause mild GI upset in cats",
                "Within 72 hours, as the toxin is slow-acting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lilies of the Lilium and Hemerocallis genera are highly nephrotoxic to cats. Even a small amount of pollen or water from the vase can cause acute kidney injury within 12-72 hours, making immediate intervention (within 18 hours) vital for survival."

            "question": "What is the physiological mechanism that makes Xylitol (Birch Sugar) life-threatening to dogs but generally safe for humans?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a massive, rapid release of insulin leading to profound hypoglycemia",
                "It causes immediate calcification of the heart valves",
                "It triggers an allergic reaction that closes the airway",
                "It prevents the absorption of Vitamin C in the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In dogs, xylitol is a potent stimulator of insulin release. This leads to a rapid, dose-dependent drop in blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and can also lead to acute hepatic necrosis (liver failure)."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) toxicosis is a critical concern for avian households. At what temperature do non-stick pans typically begin releasing these lethal gases?",
            "options": [
                "100°F (37°C)",
                "212°F (100°C)",
                "530°F (280°C)",
                "Over 1,000°F (537°C)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When PTFE (Teflon) is heated above 530°F (280°C), it undergoes thermal degradation and releases toxic fumes. Because birds have highly efficient respiratory systems, these particulates cause rapid pulmonary hemorrhage and death."

            "question": "A dog presents with 'Shake and Bake' syndrome (muscle tremors and severe hyperthermia) after playing in a garden. Which external hazard is the most likely culprit?",
            "options": [
                "Glyphosate (RoundUp)",
                "Metaldehyde (Snail and Slug Bait)",
                "Nitrogen-based fertilizer",
                "Pine mulch ingestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metaldehyde, the active ingredient in many snail and slug baits, causes 'Shake and Bake' syndrome. It leads to severe muscle tremors, seizures, and life-threatening hyperthermia (elevated body temperature) due to the constant muscle activity."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which specific toxin found in Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) blooms is responsible for rapid, often fatal, hepatotoxicity in dogs?",
            "options": [
                "Microcystins",
                "Fluoride",
                "Chloramine",
                "Calcium Carbonate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Microcystins are the most common cyanotoxins found in blue-green algae blooms. They target the liver, causing massive hepatic necrosis and often leading to death within hours of exposure."

            "question": "When assessing indoor air quality, why are 'Plug-in' air fresheners and scented candles specifically discouraged for pet wellness?",
            "options": [
                "They consume too much oxygen from the room",
                "They contain Phthalates and VOCs that can disrupt endocrine function and irritate sensitive respiratory linings",
                "The light from candles causes feline cataracts",
                "The scent molecules are too large for pets to smell"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthetic fragrances often contain Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Phthalates. These chemicals are respiratory irritants and known endocrine disruptors, which are particularly impactful on smaller animals with faster metabolic rates."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Which of the following 'human foods' causes Heinz Body Anemia in pets through oxidative damage to red blood cells?",
            "options": [
                "Macadamia nuts",
                "Avocados",
                "Allium species (Onions, Garlic, Leeks)",
                "Raw potatoes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allium species contain N-propyl disulfide, which causes oxidative damage to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. This results in the formation of Heinz bodies and subsequent hemolytic anemia."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "In an emergency poisoning scenario, when is inducing emesis (vomiting) strictly CONTRAINDICATED?",
            "options": [
                "If the pet ingested the toxin more than 10 minutes ago",
                "If the substance is a corrosive (acid/alkali) or a hydrocarbon (gasoline)",
                "If the pet is a large breed dog",
                "If the toxin was a grape or raisin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inducing vomiting is contraindicated for corrosive substances (which cause a 'second burn' on the way back up) and hydrocarbons (which carry a high risk of aspiration pneumonia)."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Why are cats more susceptible to toxicity from essential oils containing phenols (like Tea Tree or Oregano oil) than dogs?",
            "options": [
                "Cats have a higher body fat percentage",
                "Cats lack the liver enzyme glucuronyl transferase needed for glucuronidation",
                "Cats' skin is thicker and absorbs oil faster",
                "Cats have no sense of smell to detect the danger"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Feline physiology is unique in that cats are deficient in the enzyme glucuronyl transferase. This limits their ability to metabolize and excrete certain compounds, especially phenols and salicylates found in many essential oils."
