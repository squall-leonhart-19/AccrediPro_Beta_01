            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "In the P.A.W.S. Protocol for emergency triage, what does the 'P' specifically stand for to ensure immediate life-saving stabilization?",
            "options": ["Pulse and Perfusion Assessment", "Pain Management Protocol", "Preliminary Patient History", "Pharyngeal Airway Clearance"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "P.A.W.S. stands for Pulse/Perfusion, Airway/Breathing, Wound/Whole-body, and Stabilization. Assessing perfusion (capillary refill time, mucous membrane color) is the first priority to identify shock."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "When managing Advanced Nutritional Support for a pet in multi-systemic failure, what metabolic phenomenon must be avoided by introducing calories at only 25-33% of the Resting Energy Requirement (RER) initially?",
            "options": ["Hyperglycemic Crisis", "Refeeding Syndrome", "Azotemia Escalation", "Hepatic Lipidosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Refeeding Syndrome occurs when calories are introduced too quickly to a starved or critically ill patient, leading to dangerous shifts in electrolytes, specifically hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to Oncology Wellness standards, why is high-dose antioxidant supplementation (such as Vitamin E or C) often paused during active radiation or certain chemotherapies?",
            "options": ["It increases the risk of renal toxicity", "It may protect cancer cells from the oxidative damage intended by the treatment", "It causes immediate gastrointestinal sloughing", "It neutralizes the pH of the IV chemotherapy agents"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many cancer treatments work by creating free radicals to destroy DNA in cancer cells. High-dose antioxidants can inadvertently protect the tumor cells from this therapeutic oxidative stress."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A pet is classified as being in 'Status Epilepticus' if they experience a continuous seizure lasting longer than:",
            "options": ["2 minutes", "5 minutes", "10 minutes", "15 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Status Epilepticus is defined as a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or multiple seizures without a return to consciousness, representing a true neurological emergency that can cause permanent brain damage."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In the HHHHHMM Quality of Life scale used in Palliative Care, what do the two 'M's represent?",
            "options": ["Medication and Management", "Mobility and Mentation", "Metabolism and Muscle", "Maintenance and Motivation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HHHHHMM scale stands for Hurt, Hunger, Hydration, Hygiene, Happiness, Mobility, and Mentation. These two 'M's assess the pet's ability to move and their cognitive awareness/engagement."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "When treating Refractory GI Collapse, what is the primary clinical objective of a Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT)?",
            "options": ["To provide immediate caloric absorption", "To reset the immune system's response to food allergens", "To restore microbial diversity and outcompete pathogenic bacteria like C. difficile", "To thicken the mucosal lining through high-fiber delivery"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FMT is used in refractory cases to introduce a diverse population of healthy bacteria, which helps restore the 'microbiome organ' and suppress overgrowths of harmful, dysbiotic bacteria."

        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "During an 'Autoimmune Storm' (such as IMHA), what is the primary risk of the 'Hypercoagulable State' often seen in these patients?",
            "options": ["Spontaneous hemorrhage", "Pulmonary Thromboembolism (PTE)", "Acute Renal Failure", "Hypoglycemia"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune crises like Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia, the systemic inflammation and red blood cell destruction significantly increase the risk of blood clots, with PTE being a leading cause of death."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which ethical framework is recommended for practitioners to manage 'Moral Distress' when a client's wishes conflict with the pet's welfare?",
            "options": ["The Four-Box Method (Clinical, Preferences, QoL, Contextual)", "The Paternalistic Approach", "The Financial Priority Model", "The Path of Least Resistance Protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Four-Box Method allows practitioners to objectively weigh clinical indications, client preferences, quality of life, and contextual features (finances, legalities) to reach an ethical consensus."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "An IVDD patient is graded as a 'Grade 4.' What clinical signs are associated with this classification?",
            "options": ["Pain only, no neurological deficits", "Ataxic but able to walk", "Paralyzed (Pleagic) but retains deep pain sensation", "Paralyzed with no deep pain sensation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grade 4 IVDD involves paralysis (inability to move the limbs) but the patient still perceives deep pain (nociception). Grade 5 is the loss of deep pain, which carries a much poorer prognosis."

        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In a case of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), why is a 'Protein-Sparing' nutritional strategy critical?",
            "options": ["To prevent the body from catabolizing its own lean muscle for gluconeogenesis", "To reduce the workload on the kidneys", "To prevent the 'Ammonia Spike' associated with liver failure", "To encourage the pet to eat more fats"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Critically ill pets enter a hypermetabolic state where they break down muscle tissue for energy. Providing high-quality, highly digestible protein helps 'spare' their existing muscle mass and supports immune function."
