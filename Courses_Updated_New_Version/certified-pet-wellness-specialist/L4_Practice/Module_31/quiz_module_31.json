            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'The Authority Edge,' what is the primary psychological driver that allows a Specialist to charge 3-5x more than a generalist?",
            "options": [
                "The scarcity of time and the perception of specialized expertise solving a specific 'bleeding neck' problem.",
                "The use of high-end branding colors like burgundy and gold.",
                "Having more years of experience than the average pet store employee.",
                "Offering more services in a single bundle than any competitor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Authority positioning shifts the client's focus from 'cost per hour' to 'value of the solution.' Specialists solve specific, high-stakes problems, which justifies premium pricing through the scarcity of that specific expertise."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Package design moves the practitioner away from 'trading hours for dollars,' which creates a glass ceiling on income. It aligns the practitioner's incentives with the client's goal: achieving a specific result."

                "A prospect typically needs to interact with your brand at least 7 times before making a high-ticket purchase.",
                "It takes 7 weeks to train a pet to accept a new wellness routine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Rule of 7 is a classic marketing principle stating that prospects need multiple touchpoints (educational content, emails, social posts) to build enough trust for a premium investment."

                "Local boutique pet toy stores."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Veterinarians hold the highest level of trust with pet owners regarding health. A referral from a vet acts as a 'warm' endorsement that significantly lowers the barrier to sale."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A lead magnet (e.g., a PDF guide on '5 Foods to Stop Canine Inflammation') is designed to capture leads so the specialist can nurture them through an automated email sequence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lifetime Value (LTV) is crucial because it is much cheaper to retain an existing client than to acquire a new one. High LTV allows for higher 'Cost Per Acquisition' (CPA) in marketing."

            "question": "A Specialist notices their website has 1,000 visitors a month but only 2 people book calls. Based on Lesson 5, what is the first 'leverage point' they should optimize?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "0.2% conversion is a sign of a 'leaky bucket.' Before adding more traffic (ad spend), the specialist must optimize the digital infrastructure to convert the existing traffic more effectively."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proactive objection handling through content builds massive authority. By the time a prospect gets on a call, they are already 'pre-sold' because their doubts have been addressed by your educational materials."
