            "question": "What is the primary strategic advantage of the 'Cohort Effect' in pet wellness programs compared to traditional 1:1 consulting?",
            "options": [
                "Lower operational costs for the practitioner",
                "Increased social proof and peer-to-peer accountability for the owners",
                "Reduced need for customized wellness plans",
                "Simplified logistics and scheduling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cohort Effect leverages social proof and peer accountability, which significantly increases client compliance and motivation as participants see others achieving similar milestones."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Homogeneity in temperament and reactivity is vital for group safety. A single reactive or highly stressed pet can disrupt the physiological state of the entire group, hindering the wellness objectives."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An MVT is designed to give participants a tangible result early in the program, which builds momentum and ensures they remain committed to the more complex aspects of the curriculum."

                "Ignore the outlier and focus on the majority of the group",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective facilitation requires providing modifications or 'regressions' for outliers, ensuring they feel supported without compromising the flow and value for the rest of the cohort."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hybrid models (initial fee + ongoing maintenance membership) provide financial stability for the practitioner and ensure the pet receives ongoing support after the intensive workshop phase."

                "25%",
