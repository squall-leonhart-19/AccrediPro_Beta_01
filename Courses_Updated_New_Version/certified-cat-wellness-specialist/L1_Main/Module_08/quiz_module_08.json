            "options": [
                "To diagnose and treat feline diseases exclusively through medication.",
                "To provide holistic, preventative guidance focusing on a cat's overall well-being and species-specific needs.",
                "To train cats for competitive events and obedience trials.",
                "To replace veterinary care as the primary source of feline health information."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CCWS role emphasizes a holistic and preventative approach, focusing on understanding and meeting a cat's natural instincts and individual needs to promote overall wellness, rather than diagnosing or treating medical conditions."

            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on feline evolution, which characteristic of their ancestor, *Felis lybica* (the African Wildcat), has the most significant impact on the domestic cat's natural hunting behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Its preference for large, social hunting groups.",
                "Its primary reliance on scavenging for sustenance.",
                "Its solitary, ambush-predator strategy, often active during crepuscular hours.",
                "Its ability to synthesize all essential nutrients from plant matter."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Domestic cats retain the solitary, ambush-predator instincts of their ancestors, typically hunting alone during dawn and dusk (crepuscular hours), which informs their play behavior and need for enrichment."

            "options": [
                "Aggression or territorial warning.",
                "Fear or anxiety, indicating a need for space.",
                "Relaxation, trust, and affiliative intent.",
                "An immediate demand for food or attention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow blinks, often called 'cat kisses,' are a key affiliative signal indicating comfort, trust, and a lack of threat. It's a positive form of communication."

            "options": [
                "All resources (food, water, litter) should be placed in a single, central location for easy access.",
                "Resources should be provided in multiple locations, both horizontally and vertically, to minimize competition and reduce stress.",
                "Each cat should have only one designated resource station to prevent confusion.",
                "Resources should be hidden to encourage hunting instincts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proper resource distribution, meaning multiple, separated stations for food, water, and litter, is crucial in multi-cat homes to prevent conflict, reduce competition, and allow cats to access essential items without fear or stress."

            "question": "According to Lesson 5 on feline nutrition, which of the following is an essential nutrient that cats, as obligate carnivores, cannot synthesize sufficiently from plant precursors and must obtain pre-formed from animal sources?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cats cannot convert beta-carotene into Vitamin A efficiently, thus requiring pre-formed Vitamin A (retinol) directly from animal tissues in their diet. This is a hallmark of their obligate carnivore status."

            "options": [
                "To identify the current medication regimen for immediate adjustment.",
                "To diagnose any undiagnosed medical conditions.",

                "To determine the cat's microchip number for identification purposes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A thorough review of past veterinary records provides crucial context, highlighting chronic conditions, past injuries, or behavioral issues that may be linked to health, helping to build a complete 'profile' for wellness planning."

            "question": "During the 'P' - Profile & Preferences (Part 2: Environmental & Behavioral Assessment)' phase (Lesson 7), a CCWS observes a cat consistently urinating outside the litter box shortly after a new kitten was introduced. What is the most likely initial interpretation of this behavior?",
            "options": [
                "The cat is marking territory due to a perceived threat from the new kitten, indicating a social stressor.",
                "The cat has a urinary tract infection and requires immediate veterinary intervention.",
                "The cat is simply protesting the type of litter used.",
                "The cat is attempting to communicate a desire for more playtime."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Inappropriate elimination, especially after a significant household change like a new pet, is a common sign of stress and territorial marking in cats. While a vet check is always prudent for elimination issues, the context points strongly to a social stressor."

            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses common feline stressors. Which of the following is a well-established physiological consequence of chronic stress in cats, often linked to conditions like Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)?",
            "options": [
                "Significantly increased bone density.",
                "Enhanced cognitive function and learning ability.",
                "Suppression of the immune system and disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.",
                "Rapid and sustained weight gain due to increased metabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress activates the HPA axis, leading to prolonged cortisol elevation, which can suppress the immune system, disrupt gut health, and exacerbate stress-related conditions like FIC."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A CCWS is advising a client whose single indoor cat is exhibiting destructive scratching on furniture, despite having a tall scratching post. Based on Lesson 4's principles of environmental enrichment, what might be a missing element to address this behavior?",
            "options": [
                "The cat needs more outdoor access.",
                "The scratching post is likely too short or unstable, or the material is not preferred.",
                "The cat is trying to communicate a desire for a new diet.",
                "The cat requires a companion animal to deter destructive behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scratching is an innate behavior. If a cat scratches inappropriately despite having a post, the post itself may be unsuitable – too short, wobbly, or made of an undesirable material (e.g., carpet instead of sisal or cardboard). Cats need sturdy, tall posts allowing full body extension."

            "question": "A client's cat, 'Luna,' is an indoor-only cat fed exclusively dry kibble. The client reports Luna rarely drinks from her water bowl. Based on Lesson 5's feline nutrition fundamentals, what is the primary concern for Luna's long-term health?",
            "options": [
                "She is likely consuming too many carbohydrates, leading to diabetes.",
                "She is at a higher risk for chronic dehydration and associated urinary tract issues.",
                "She is not receiving enough fiber, which will cause constipation.",
                "She is consuming an excess of animal protein, which is detrimental to kidney health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats have a low thirst drive evolved from obtaining most moisture from prey. An exclusive dry kibble diet, especially without adequate water intake, significantly increases the risk of chronic low-grade dehydration, predisposing them to urinary tract issues like crystal formation or Feline Idiopathic Cystitis."
