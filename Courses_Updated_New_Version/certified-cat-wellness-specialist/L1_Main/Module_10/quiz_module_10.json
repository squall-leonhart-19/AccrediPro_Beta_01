            "question": "During the 'Profiling' stage (P), which assessment technique is crucial for understanding a cat's individual environmental needs and behavioral patterns, particularly for identifying subtle stressors not apparent in a brief observation?",
            "options": [
                "Extensive dietary analysis focusing only on macronutrient intake.",
                "In-depth behavioral ethogram development, environmental mapping, and owner-reported daily routine logs.",
                "Genetic predisposition testing exclusively to predict future health issues.",
                "A one-time veterinary check-up without any follow-up behavioral observation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced Profiling requires detailed observation, documentation (ethograms), and understanding of the cat's environment and daily life. This comprehensive approach helps uncover subtle stressors and behavioral nuances critical for accurate assessment."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) on feline social dynamics found that approximately <span class=\"stat-highlight\">25-30%</span> of domestic cats exhibit a strong preference for solitary living, even within multi-cat households. How does this finding directly influence the 'Profiling' stage when assessing a multi-cat home?",
            "options": [
                "It suggests that all cats in a multi-cat household inherently require constant social interaction.",
                "It emphasizes the critical importance of assessing each cat's individual social preferences and providing ample resources to prevent competition and stress.",
                "It indicates that social enrichment is always the most beneficial intervention for all cats, regardless of their individual preferences.",
                "It implies that cats cannot form strong bonds with humans in a multi-cat setting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This statistic highlights the significant individual variation in feline social needs. During 'Profiling,' understanding each cat's unique preference for solitude versus social interaction is vital to ensure environmental design and resource allocation minimize stress and promote well-being in multi-cat environments."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "During the 'Analyzing Root Causes' (A) stage, a cat presents with excessive grooming leading to skin lesions on its abdomen. Which finding would most likely be identified as a primary root cause, rather than a secondary symptom or consequence?",
            "options": [
                "The cat has developed a bald patch on its abdomen.",
                "The owner reports a recent, significant change in household dynamics, such as a new baby or pet, coinciding with the onset of grooming.",
                "The cat's skin is inflamed and irritated from constant licking.",
                "The cat exhibits signs of anxiety, such as tail tucking and hiding, only when strangers visit."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A significant change in household dynamics often acts as a primary stressor, leading to anxiety, which can manifest as excessive grooming (a secondary symptom). The bald patch and inflamed skin are direct consequences of the grooming, while generalized anxiety is a symptom of the underlying stressor."

                "Punishing the cat with a water spray every time it scratches furniture.",
                "Providing multiple appropriate scratching posts with varying textures (e.g., sisal, cardboard, carpet) and orientations (vertical, horizontal), strategically placed in key areas.",
                "Considering declawing as a permanent solution to prevent furniture damage.",
                "Restricting the cat's access to all furniture, which does not address the underlying need to scratch."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats have an innate need to scratch for claw maintenance, stretching, and scent marking. An instinct-driven intervention focuses on redirecting this natural behavior to appropriate outlets by providing attractive, varied, and well-placed scratching surfaces, rather than punishment or invasive procedures."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tailoring a wellness plan for a senior cat with arthritis requires a multi-faceted approach.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective implementation and monitoring require active owner engagement and structured data collection.

            "options": [
                "Maintaining a completely static environment to avoid any changes, which is often unrealistic and can hinder adaptability.",
                "Developing the cat's adaptive coping mechanisms, providing ongoing preventive care, continuous enrichment, and proactive management of potential future stressors.",
                "Attempting to eliminate all potential stressors from the cat's life permanently, which is an unattainable goal.",
                "Immediately reverting to previous, less effective interventions if any minor behavioral issues arise, rather than adapting the current plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term resilience involves equipping the cat with skills to adapt to change and managing potential future challenges proactively.

According to The P.A.W.S. Method™, what is the appropriate next step for the specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Conclude the case as the primary issue (aggression) has been resolved.",
                "Re-initiate the 'Profiling' (P) and 'Analyzing Root Causes' (A) stages, treating the new behavioral change as a new challenge requiring assessment.",
                "Instruct the owner to ignore the new behavior, as it's likely a temporary adjustment.",
                "Recommend immediate rehoming if the new behavior is concerning or disruptive."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The P.A.W.S. Method™ is iterative.
