            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cats require essential nutrients like taurine and arginine, found almost exclusively in animal tissue, highlighting their obligate carnivore status. Their digestive system and dentition are adapted for meat consumption, not plant matter or complex carbohydrate digestion."

            "explanation": "While dietary history is important, a comprehensive list of *all* specific brands consumed over a lifetime is less directly relevant to current preferences and well-being than daily routines, behavioral history, and observed responses to stimuli which reveal personality and comfort levels."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Considering the natural predatory instincts of cats (L2) and principles of environmental enrichment (L6), which strategy would be <span class=\"highlight\">most</span> effective in reducing a cat's frustration and potential stress related to its indoor environment?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a single large food bowl that is always full.",
                "Implementing scheduled, interactive play sessions that mimic hunting sequences.",

                "Introducing multiple new feline companions to stimulate social interaction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Structured play that mimics the 'hunt, catch, kill, eat' cycle allows cats to express their natural predatory behaviors, fulfilling an innate drive and reducing frustration that can arise from a lack of outlet in an indoor environment. A constantly full bowl and restricting vertical space are counterproductive, and new companions can increase stress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'slow blink' is a well-documented visual cue in feline communication, interpreted as a sign of trust, relaxation, and affection. Reciprocating it can strengthen the human-animal bond and contribute positively to the cat's emotional well-being."
