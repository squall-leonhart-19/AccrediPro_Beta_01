            "question": "A 12-year-old cat, diagnosed with IRIS Stage 2 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), is struggling with appetite. Which nutritional strategy, beyond a phosphorus-restricted diet, is crucial for supporting this cat's overall well-being and slowing disease progression?",
            "options": [
                "Significantly increasing protein intake to maintain muscle mass.",
                "Prioritizing highly digestible protein sources and omega-3 fatty acids.",
                "Supplementing with high levels of calcium to counteract phosphorus restriction.",
                "Exclusive feeding of grain-free raw food for improved nutrient absorption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For cats with CKD, highly digestible protein prevents the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products while meeting essential amino acid needs. Omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial for their anti-inflammatory effects, which can help manage kidney disease progression. Significantly increasing protein can worsen kidney workload, and high calcium is not a primary strategy for phosphorus restriction."

            "question": "A cat exhibits significant fear and hiding behavior during thunderstorms. A Certified Cat Wellness Specialist recommends a multimodal approach. Which combination represents an effective, non-pharmacological strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate introduction of a new cat companion and a high-fat diet.",
                "Daily administration of anxiolytic medication and constant social interaction.",
                "Creating a safe 'den' area, pheromone diffusion, and desensitization/counter-conditioning.",
                "Restricting food intake to reduce energy and forced exposure to the storm sounds."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A multimodal approach for fear and anxiety often includes environmental modifications (safe den), synthetic pheromones (e.g., Feliway Classic), and behavior modification techniques like desensitization and counter-conditioning to change the cat's emotional response to the trigger. The other options are either inappropriate or involve pharmacological intervention."

            "question": "During a home visit, you observe a cat with slightly dilated pupils, ears rotated sideways, a low crouch, and a tail held low and tucked. What does this combination of body language most strongly indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Intense playfulness and readiness for interaction.",
                "Relaxed contentment and a desire for petting.",
                "Fear, anxiety, and a potential readiness to flee or defend.",
                "Curiosity about a new object and playful investigation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dilated pupils, sideways ears, a low crouch, and a tucked tail are classic indicators of fear, anxiety, and defensive posture in cats. These are clear stress signals that suggest the cat may be preparing to flee or, if cornered, defend itself."

            "question": "A client reports their 7-year-old male cat has suddenly started urinating outside the litter box, despite having been perfectly litter-trained for years. Before implementing behavioral interventions, what is the *first* crucial step for the wellness specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately recommend a different type of litter and box.",
                "Advise the client to restrict the cat's access to certain rooms.",
                "Recommend a full veterinary examination to rule out medical causes.",
                "Suggest placing deterrents near the soiled areas."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Any sudden change in elimination behavior, especially in a previously litter-trained cat, warrants an immediate veterinary check-up. Medical conditions such as urinary tract infections, bladder stones, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or arthritis can all cause inappropriate urination and must be ruled out before behavioral interventions are considered."

            "question": "For an 18-year-old cat with mild arthritis and reduced mobility, which environmental enrichment strategy is most appropriate and beneficial?",
            "options": [
                "Introducing high, multi-level climbing structures to encourage activity.",
                "Providing puzzle feeders that require complex manipulation and reaching.",
                "Offering easily accessible, low-entry litter boxes and padded resting spots at lower levels.",
                "Encouraging frequent, vigorous play sessions with laser pointers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senior cats with arthritis benefit most from modifications that reduce physical strain. Low-entry litter boxes prevent painful climbing, and padded resting spots at ground level offer comfort and easy access. High climbing structures, complex puzzle feeders, and vigorous play can exacerbate joint pain."

            "question": "A client describes their 15-year-old cat as increasingly disoriented, vocalizing more at night, and sometimes struggling to find the litter box even when close. These symptoms are most indicative of:",
            "options": [
                "Hyperthyroidism, requiring immediate dietary changes.",
                "Feline Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (FCDS).",
                "Acute pain from an injury, requiring analgesics.",
                "Normal age-related behavioral changes that require no intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described (disorientation, increased nocturnal vocalization, and litter box mishaps) are classic signs of Feline Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (FCDS), often compared to Alzheimer's in humans. While other conditions can cause some of these, the combination strongly points to cognitive decline."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "A client expresses skepticism about implementing recommended environmental changes for their cat's anxiety, stating, 'I've tried everything, nothing works.' Which response, aligned with motivational interviewing principles, would be most effective?",
            "options": [
                "'You haven't tried *everything* if you haven't done what I suggested.'",
                "'It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and perhaps a bit discouraged. What concerns do you have about these new suggestions?'",
                "'If you don't follow these steps, your cat's anxiety will only get worse.'",
                "'Just trust me, these methods are scientifically proven to work.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motivational interviewing emphasizes empathy and collaboration. Acknowledging the client's frustration and inviting them to share their concerns (option B) is a non-confrontational way to explore their resistance and build rapport, fostering a more open dialogue. The other options are confrontational, dismissive, or prescriptive, which can increase client resistance."

            "question": "When assessing the Quality of Life (QoL) for a cat with a chronic illness, which of the following is *least* directly relevant to the cat's current well-being from a palliative care perspective?",
            "options": [
                "The cat's ability to engage in normal behaviors like grooming and eating.",
                "Presence and severity of pain, nausea, or respiratory distress.",
                "The owner's emotional attachment to the cat.",
                "The cat's level of interaction with family members and environment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the owner's emotional attachment is crucial for their decision-making process, it is less directly relevant to the *cat's* immediate physical and psychological well-being when assessing Quality of Life from a palliative care perspective. QoL tools typically focus on the cat's comfort, appetite, hydration, hygiene, happiness, mobility, and overall interaction with its environment."

            "question": "For a cat diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) experiencing chronic vomiting and diarrhea, a trial of a novel protein or hydrolyzed diet is often recommended. What is the primary therapeutic goal of this approach?",
            "options": [
                "To drastically increase fiber intake for bowel regularity.",
                "To reduce the antigenic load and minimize immune system reactions to food proteins.",
                "To provide a high-calorie diet to combat weight loss rapidly.",
                "To eliminate all carbohydrates from the diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal of feeding novel protein or hydrolyzed diets in IBD is to reduce the antigenic load in the gut. By providing protein sources that the cat's immune system has not previously encountered (novel) or protein that has been broken down into very small peptides (hydrolyzed), the likelihood of an adverse immune reaction contributing to inflammation is significantly lowered."

            "question": "A multi-cat household is experiencing increasing inter-cat aggression, primarily resource-related. Which intervention is most likely to reduce conflict and improve feline harmony?",
            "options": [
                "Forcing the cats to share food bowls and litter boxes to encourage bonding.",
                "Providing multiple, spatially separated resources (food, water, litter boxes, resting spots) in excess of the number of cats.",
                "Using a spray bottle to deter aggressive interactions whenever they occur.",
                "Isolating the aggressor cat permanently to prevent further conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resource-related aggression is best addressed by increasing resource availability and ensuring spatial separation. The general rule of thumb is N+1 (number of cats + 1) for essential resources like litter boxes, food bowls, and water stations, placed in different locations to prevent competition and ambush opportunities. Forcing sharing or using aversive techniques like spray bottles can worsen anxiety and aggression."
