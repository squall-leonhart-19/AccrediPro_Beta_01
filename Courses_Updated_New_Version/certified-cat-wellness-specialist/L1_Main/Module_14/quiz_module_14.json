            "question": "In the AccrediPro P.A.W.S. Method™, the initial 'P' stands for Profile & Preferences. Which of the following best describes the primary goal of this stage?",
            "options": [
                "To understand the cat's unique biological, behavioral, and environmental history.",
                "To analyze existing health issues and align them with veterinary treatments.",
                "To support the client in implementing new care routines.",
                "To assess the cat's immediate well-being and welfare status."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'P' stage focuses on gathering comprehensive information about the individual cat to build a holistic profile, including its unique preferences, history, and current environment. This foundational understanding is crucial before moving to analysis or intervention."

            "question": "The evolutionary history of _Felis silvestris lybica_ as a semi-solitary predator with a need for secure vantage points strongly influences modern domestic cat behavior. Which environmental provision directly caters to this ancestral instinct for safety and observation?",
            "options": [
                "Providing multiple food bowls on the ground floor.",
                "Offering a variety of puzzle toys.",
                "Installing vertical climbing structures and elevated perches.",
                "Ensuring consistent daily play sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cats' ancestral need for safety and observation points, especially as ambush predators, drives their preference for vertical space and elevated perches. These structures allow them to survey their territory, escape potential threats, and feel secure, directly catering to their evolutionary instincts."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client with three cats reports frequent tension and occasional physical altercations between two of them. During the Profile & Preferences stage, you learn they have two litter boxes, one food station, and one water bowl, all located in the kitchen. Based on principles of feline environmental needs, what is the most critical immediate recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the number of scratching posts available.",
                "Implement structured play sessions for all cats together.",
                "Distribute essential resources (food, water, litter) in multiple, separate locations.",
                "Introduce new interactive toys to distract them."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resource guarding and competition are common stressors in multi-cat households, often leading to conflict. Distributing essential resources (food, water, litter boxes) in multiple, separate locations reduces competition and allows cats to access necessities without direct confrontation, minimizing tension and improving individual welfare."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A cat is observed with its body low to the ground, tail tucked tightly, ears flattened sideways, and pupils dilated, accompanied by a low hiss. According to feline communication principles, this cluster of body language cues most reliably indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Playfulness and readiness for interaction.",
                "Contentment and relaxation.",
                "Fear, defensiveness, and potential aggression.",
                "Curiosity and readiness to explore."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These are classic and unmistakable signs of a fearful or defensive cat. The combination of a low posture, tucked tail, flattened ears, dilated pupils, and a hiss signals high arousal, discomfort, and a potential for aggression if the cat feels cornered or threatened."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Feline nutrition emphasizes the cat's status as an obligate carnivore. Given this, which nutritional characteristic is considered a fundamental requirement for a species-appropriate diet and why?",
            "options": [
                "High carbohydrate content for sustained energy, as cats efficiently metabolize starches.",
                "High moisture content to support kidney health, reflecting their desert ancestry and low thirst drive.",
                "Significant plant-based protein sources, as these are easily digestible and complete.",
                "Low fat content to prevent obesity, as cats struggle with fat metabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats, originating from desert environments, have a low thirst drive and historically obtained most of their moisture from prey. A high-moisture diet (typically wet food) is crucial for supporting hydration and kidney health, especially given the prevalence of renal issues in older cats. They also require high protein and moderate fat, not low fat or high carbs."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "During the Client Intake and Initial Assessment (part of P - Profile & Preferences) for a cat exhibiting new behavioral issues, a comprehensive history is vital. Which of the following pieces of information would generally be considered LEAST critical for the *initial* assessment phase, assuming all other options are readily available?",
            "options": [
                "Detailed medical history, including recent veterinary visits and medications.",
                "The exact brand and ingredients list of the cat's current food.",
                "A complete list of all the cat's favorite toys and play preferences.",
                "A precise breakdown of the cat's daily caloric intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While caloric intake is important for long-term diet management and weight control, the initial assessment for behavioral issues would prioritize medical history, the general type and quality of the current diet, and play preferences to understand the cat's overall well-being and environmental fit. A precise caloric breakdown is often a more detailed step for dietary adjustments later in the process."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "During an Observational Assessment, a Certified Cat Wellness Specialist notices a cat frequently holding its head low, walking with a stiff gait, and showing reluctance to jump onto familiar surfaces. These physical cues, in conjunction with behavioral changes like reduced grooming, strongly suggest:",
            "options": [
                "A heightened state of playfulness.",
                "The cat is experiencing pain or musculoskeletal discomfort.",
                "The cat is exhibiting signs of territorial marking.",
                "The cat is simply aging and slowing down, which is normal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Changes in posture (head low), gait (stiff), and reluctance to perform normal movements (like jumping) are common and significant indicators of pain or musculoskeletal discomfort in cats. Reduced or altered grooming can also be a sign, as grooming may become painful or difficult."

            "question": "A client reports their previously calm cat, Mittens, has suddenly developed Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) after a recent move to a new apartment. This condition is often linked to stress. Which of the following stressors is most likely the primary trigger for Mittens' FIC in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Insufficient vertical climbing structures in the new home.",
                "A sudden change in diet to a new brand of kibble.",
                "An acute environmental change and disruption of routine.",
                "Lack of interaction with other cats in the new neighborhood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FIC is a classic stress-related condition in cats. An acute environmental change like moving to a new apartment is a significant stressor that disrupts a cat's established territory and routine, making it a very common and direct trigger for conditions like FIC. While other factors might contribute, the move is the most likely primary stressor here."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client expresses concern that their indoor cat, Luna, seems bored and rarely engages in play. As a Certified Cat Wellness Specialist, you would address this in the P - Profile & Preferences stage. Which action aligns best with this stage's focus on understanding Luna's specific needs?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately recommend a specific brand of interactive feeder.",
                "Develop a detailed 7-day play schedule for the client to follow.",
                "Ask the client about Luna's past play history, preferred toy types, and typical play intensity.",
                "Advise the client to get another cat for Luna to play with."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Profile & Preferences' stage is fundamentally about understanding the individual cat. Asking about Luna's past play history, specific toy preferences, and typical play intensity allows the specialist to build a comprehensive profile of her unique needs and interests before recommending any interventions or solutions."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A client has two adult cats, Shadow and Whiskers, living in a relatively small two-bedroom apartment. Shadow frequently hides under beds and sometimes swats at Whiskers when they pass each other in narrow hallways. Based on feline territoriality and spatial needs, which intervention is most likely to reduce tension and improve both cats' welfare?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the number of shared food and water bowls to encourage communal eating.",
                "Ensure there are multiple, easily accessible escape routes and distinct 'safe zones' for each cat.",
                "Introduce new pheromone diffusers throughout the entire apartment immediately.",
                "Schedule daily forced interaction sessions between Shadow and Whiskers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In multi-cat households, especially in smaller spaces, lack of personal space and easily accessible escape routes can be a major stressor. Providing multiple, distinct 'safe zones' and clear escape routes allows cats to avoid unwanted interactions and reduces territorial conflict, directly addressing the underlying cause of hiding and aggression. Communal eating can increase stress, and forced interaction would likely escalate tension."
