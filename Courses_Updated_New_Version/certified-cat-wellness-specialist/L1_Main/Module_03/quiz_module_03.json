            "question": "A client with an obese cat experiencing chronic dehydration asks about the optimal dietary strategy. Based on advanced feline nutritional principles, which of the following macronutrient profiles and moisture content is most appropriate for promoting vitality and addressing these concerns?",
            "options": [
                "High carbohydrate (40%), moderate protein (30%), low moisture (dry kibble).",
                "High protein (50-60%), moderate fat (20-30%), high moisture (wet or raw food).",
                "Low protein (20%), high fat (40%), moderate moisture (semi-moist food).",
                "Balanced plant-based protein (35%), low fat (15%), high moisture."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Felines are obligate carnivores requiring high protein and moderate fat. High moisture content is crucial for hydration and kidney health, especially in cats prone to obesity and dehydration, as highlighted in studies on feline lower urinary tract disease prevention (e.g., Buffington et al., 2006)."

            "options": [
                "Providing a single large food bowl for communal eating.",
                "Increasing the number of ground-level hiding spots only.",
                "Maximizing vertical space with cat trees, shelves, and elevated perches.",
                "Introducing novel toys daily to distract them from each other."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vertical space allows cats to observe their territory from a safe vantage point, escape perceived threats, and establish a vertical hierarchy, which is crucial for reducing stress and conflict in multi-cat environments (Overall, 2013)."

            "question": "A client is preparing to move to a new home and is concerned about their cat, 'Luna,' who is prone to stress. The specialist recommends using a feline synthetic pheromone diffuser. How do these pheromones primarily work to reduce stress in cats?",
            "options": [
                "They act as a mild sedative, inducing drowsiness.",
                "They mimic natural feline facial pheromones, signaling safety and familiarity.",
                "They emit a scent that is unpleasant to other animals, creating a secure zone.",
                "They suppress the cat's natural hunting instincts, reducing arousal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Feline synthetic pheromones (e.g., Feliway) are analogs of natural facial pheromones that cats deposit when they feel secure. Dispersing these in the environment helps create a sense of calm and familiarity, as discussed in L7."

                "Tailoring the plan to Jasper's unique temperament, history, environment, and owner's lifestyle.",
                "Focusing solely on immediate symptom relief without addressing root causes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Holistic wellness plans must be highly individualized. A 'one-size-fits-all' approach often fails because each cat has unique genetic predispositions, environmental stressors, and owner dynamics that influence their overall well-being and the feasibility of interventions (L1)."

            "options": [
                "Arginine",
                "Lysine",
                "Methionine",
                "Taurine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Taurine is an essential amino acid for cats, vital for cardiac function, vision, and reproductive health. Unlike many other mammals, cats cannot synthesize sufficient taurine from other amino acids, making dietary supplementation critical, especially in homemade or vegetarian diets (L2). Deficiency can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and retinal degeneration."
