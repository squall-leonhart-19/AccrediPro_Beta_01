            "options": ["Asking direct, closed-ended questions for quick answers", "Presenting a pre-filled questionnaire for the owner to confirm", "Utilizing open-ended questions to encourage detailed narratives", "Focusing solely on the cat's physical symptoms first"],

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The general guideline for litter box provision is N+1, where N is the number of cats. For 3 cats, this means 3+1 = 4 litter boxes, which helps prevent resource guarding, ensures accessibility, and reduces stress."
