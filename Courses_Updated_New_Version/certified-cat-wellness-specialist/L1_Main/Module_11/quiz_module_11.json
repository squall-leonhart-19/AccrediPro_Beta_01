            "options": [
                "Support and Sustained Wellness",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The P.A.W.S. Method™ stands for Profiling, Assessing, Wellness Plan, and Support. The 'S' emphasizes ongoing support and strategies for sustained feline wellness, ensuring long-term success for both the cat and client."

            "question": "Which of the following is a critical, unique physiological requirement for felines due to their obligate carnivore nature, as discussed in L2?",
            "options": [
                "A high dietary fiber intake for digestive health.",
                "The ability to synthesize Vitamin C from glucose.",
                "An external dietary source of taurine.",
                "A low protein, high carbohydrate diet for energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Felines, as obligate carnivores, cannot synthesize sufficient taurine from other amino acids and must obtain it from their diet. Taurine deficiency can lead to serious health issues like dilated cardiomyopathy and retinal degeneration."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A cat approaches its owner with its tail held high, ears slightly forward, and rubs its head against the owner's leg. Based on L3's decoding of feline communication, what is this behavior most likely indicating?",
            "options": [
                "Fear or aggression",
                "A demand for immediate food",
                "Affection and greeting",
                "Anxiety about a new object"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A tail held high and head bunting (rubbing) are classic signs of affectionate greeting and social bonding in cats. This communicates contentment and a desire for interaction."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "When designing an enriched indoor environment for a multi-cat household, L4 emphasizes the importance of 'resource plentifulness'. Which strategy best exemplifies this principle?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a single, large communal litter box and food bowl.",
                "Ensuring at least one scratching post per cat.",
                "Placing all vertical perches in one area to encourage group interaction.",
                "Using only one type of interactive toy for all cats."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resource plentifulness in multi-cat homes means providing more resources than there are cats (e.g., N+1 rule for litter boxes, multiple scratching posts, food, and water stations). This minimizes competition and reduces stress, as supported by studies showing reduced inter-cat aggression with increased resource availability."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to L5 on Feline Nutrition Fundamentals, what is a primary characteristic of a species-appropriate diet for cats?",
            "options": [
                "High in plant-based proteins and complex carbohydrates.",
                "Low in fat to prevent obesity.",
                "High in animal-based protein and moderate fat.",
                "Primarily dry kibble for dental health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Felines are obligate carnivores, meaning their diet must be predominantly animal-based. A species-appropriate diet is high in animal protein, moderate in fat, and very low in carbohydrates, mimicking their natural prey diet."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A client reports their previously well-adjusted cat has started excessively grooming its abdomen, leading to bald patches, shortly after they adopted a new puppy. Based on L6's identification of feline stressors, what is the most likely underlying cause of this behavior?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden onset of a food allergy.",
                "A nutritional deficiency requiring supplementation.",

                "A primary dermatological infection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Excessive grooming (over-grooming or psychogenic alopecia) is a common behavioral manifestation of stress in cats. The introduction of a new pet is a significant environmental change and a frequent stressor, leading to displacement behaviors like over-grooming."

            "question": "In the 'P' (Profiling) stage of the P.A.W.S. Method™ (L7), beyond collecting medical history, what is a crucial area of inquiry for a Cat Wellness Specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Client's personal dietary habits.",
                "The cat's favorite TV shows.",

                "Genetic lineage solely for breed-specific health issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Profiling involves a comprehensive understanding of the cat's entire world, including their living environment, daily routines, interactions with other pets/people, and the client's goals and lifestyle. This holistic view is essential for developing an effective wellness plan."

            "question": "According to L8 on Basic Health Indicators, what is considered a normal resting respiratory rate for an adult cat, when observed calmly?",
            "options": [
                "5-10 breaths per minute",
                "10-30 breaths per minute",

                "Over 60 breaths per minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healthy adult cat's resting respiratory rate typically falls between 10-30 breaths per minute. Rates consistently above this range, especially without exertion, can be a red flag for respiratory or cardiac issues and warrant veterinary attention."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client's senior cat, 'Whiskers,' has recently become less interactive, showing reduced interest in play and spending more time isolated. Historically, Whiskers loved playing with wand toys. Based on the principles from L3 and L8, what is the most appropriate initial recommendation for the client?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately introduce a new kitten to stimulate Whiskers.",
                "Assume it's just old age and do nothing.",
                "Schedule a veterinary check-up to rule out underlying medical conditions.",
                "Force Whiskers to play more frequently to encourage activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Changes in behavior, especially decreased interaction and play in a senior cat, can be subtle signs of pain, discomfort, or underlying illness (e.g., arthritis, dental disease, organ dysfunction). A veterinary check-up is crucial to rule out medical causes before addressing behavioral aspects."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which of the following environmental enrichment strategies, as detailed in L4, is most effective for encouraging natural hunting behaviors in an indoor cat and promoting mental stimulation?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a static bowl of dry kibble available 24/7.",
                "Using puzzle feeders or hiding small portions of food for the cat to 'hunt'.",
                "Playing loud music to stimulate auditory senses.",
                "Only offering plush toys that the cat can cuddle with."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Puzzle feeders and scattering food encourage a cat's natural predatory instincts, turning mealtime into a stimulating 'hunt.' This provides cognitive enrichment, prevents boredom, and can help manage weight, contrasting with passive bowl feeding which offers no mental challenge."
