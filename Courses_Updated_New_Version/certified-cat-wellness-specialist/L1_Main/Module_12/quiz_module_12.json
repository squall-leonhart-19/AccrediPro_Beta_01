            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lessons 2 and 6 explain that ambush hunting and pouncing are innate predatory behaviors for cats. When these behaviors are directed at owners, it often indicates a lack of appropriate outlets for predatory play, rather than aggression or dominance."

Investigating inter-cat dynamics, new pets, or outdoor cat presence is crucial before other environmental factors."
