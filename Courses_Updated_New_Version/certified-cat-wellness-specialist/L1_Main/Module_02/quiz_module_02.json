            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats are obligate carnivores, and their natural hunting instincts (stalk, pounce, kill bite sequence) are deeply ingrained. Environmental enrichment must allow for the expression of these solitary hunting behaviors to meet their welfare needs."
