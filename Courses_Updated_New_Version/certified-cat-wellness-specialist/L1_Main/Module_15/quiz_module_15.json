            "explanation": "The four pillars of the P.A.W.S. Method™ are Profile & Preferences, Analyze & Align, Well-being & Watch, and Support & Sustain. 'Administer & Adjust' is not one of the designated pillars."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Domestic cats retain strong instincts from their solitary, crepuscular African wildcat ancestors, including a preference for hunting small prey alone during dawn and dusk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The general guideline for litter box provision is N+1, where N is the number of cats, to minimize competition and ensure adequate access, which is crucial for preventing inappropriate elimination."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The slow blink is a well-documented feline signal of contentment, trust, and affection. It's often referred to as a 'cat kiss' and indicates the cat feels safe and comfortable in your presence."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While health history is critical, the 'Profile & Preferences' stage focuses on establishing a baseline of the cat's normal life, environment, and behavioral patterns. Recent veterinary diagnostic results are typically gathered and analyzed during the 'Analyze & Align' phase, often in collaboration with the veterinarian."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Any sudden change in elimination behavior, such as inappropriate urination, is a significant red flag. It is critical to first rule out underlying medical conditions (e.g., urinary tract infection, kidney disease, diabetes) with a veterinary examination before addressing potential behavioral causes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "To best satisfy a cat's natural predatory instincts and need for mental stimulation, a wellness plan should ideally incorporate daily interactive play sessions that mimic hunting sequences. What is the recommended frequency and duration for these sessions?",

                "5 minutes, once a day.",
                "10-15 minutes, 2-3 times a day.",

                "60 minutes, once a day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats naturally hunt in short, frequent bursts. Providing 2-3 interactive play sessions of 10-15 minutes each day, mimicking the hunt-catch-kill sequence, is more effective for satisfying their predatory drive than one long session."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This combination of body language cues (relaxed posture, slow blink, gentle tail twitch) strongly indicates a cat that feels comfortable, secure, and trusts its surroundings and the people within it. It's a sign of a happy and relaxed cat."
