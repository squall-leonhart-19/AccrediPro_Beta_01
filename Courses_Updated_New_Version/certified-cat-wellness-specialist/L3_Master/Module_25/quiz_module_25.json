            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "According to best practices for establishing effective supervisory relationships, which factor is most crucial for fostering a strong foundation of trust and open communication, enabling the mentee to feel safe disclosing challenges?",
            "options": [
                "Clearly defined administrative tasks and reporting structures",
                "Regular scheduling of sessions at fixed times",
                "Demonstrating empathy, non-judgmental acceptance, and psychological safety",
                "Focusing solely on case outcomes and problem-solving"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Demonstrating empathy, non-judgmental acceptance, and creating a psychologically safe environment are paramount for building trust. This allows mentees to openly share their struggles, learn from mistakes, and engage in genuine self-reflection without fear of reprisal."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "When providing advanced constructive feedback on a mentee's challenging case presentation, which strategy aligns best with promoting reflective practice and skill development, rather than just offering immediate solutions?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately offering a direct solution to the case problem to save time",
                "Focusing exclusively on the mentee's errors and shortcomings in a critical manner",
                "Asking open-ended questions to guide the mentee's self-assessment and exploration of alternative perspectives",
                "Providing feedback only on successful outcomes to maintain mentee morale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Guiding the mentee through open-ended questions encourages critical thinking, self-reflection, and the development of their own problem-solving skills. This approach empowers the mentee to learn and grow, rather than becoming dependent on the supervisor for answers."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A mentee is struggling in the 'Profile' stage of the P.A.W.S. framework, reporting difficulty in gathering comprehensive baseline data for a client cat with chronic stress. As a supervisor, what is the most effective guidance to offer?",
            "options": [
                "Advise them to move directly to the 'Analyze' stage to avoid getting stuck on data collection",
                "Suggest they rely solely on owner reports and avoid direct observation to simplify the process",
                "Guide them on utilizing standardized behavioral ethograms, structured observation protocols over several days, and multiple data sources (e.g., video, environmental assessment)",
                "Recommend they only focus on the most obvious symptoms and disregard subtle behavioral cues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Profile' stage requires systematic and comprehensive data collection. Guiding the mentee to use structured observation tools like ethograms and multiple data sources ensures a thorough and objective understanding of the cat's baseline behavior, which is critical for accurate analysis."

        {
            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "During supervision for the 'Wellness Plan' stage of P.A.W.S., a mentee proposes an intervention for a cat's anxiety that lacks strong empirical support and poses potential risks. What is the supervisor's primary ethical and professional responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Allow the mentee to proceed to learn from experience, as long as it's not immediately harmful",
                "Directly rewrite the mentee's plan to be evidence-based without further discussion",
                "Guide the mentee to critically evaluate the evidence base for proposed interventions, explore alternative evidence-based strategies, and consider potential risks",
                "Advise the client cat owner about the mentee's inadequate plan, bypassing the mentee"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The supervisor's role is to ensure client safety and promote evidence-based practice. This involves guiding the mentee to critically assess their proposed plan, understand the importance of empirical support, and develop safer, more effective interventions. Directly rewriting the plan bypasses the learning opportunity."

        {
            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "A mentee informs their supervisor that a client cat owner has offered them a significant discount on pet-sitting services in exchange for continued, informal advice about the cat's behavior outside of regular, paid sessions. How should the supervisor guide the mentee regarding this ethical dilemma?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the mentee to accept the offer to build rapport and client loyalty",
                "Instruct the mentee to politely decline, explaining the boundaries of professional conduct and the potential for a dual relationship and conflicts of interest",
                "Suggest the mentee only provide advice if it's unrelated to the cat's wellness plan to avoid a direct conflict",
                "Tell the mentee to inform the client that all advice must be compensated at their full professional rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This scenario presents a clear dual relationship and potential conflict of interest. The supervisor must guide the mentee to understand and uphold professional boundaries, declining offers that compromise objectivity, professional integrity, or create undue influence."

        {
            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "To foster a mentee's professional growth and competency development, particularly in developing autonomy, critical thinking, and a strong professional identity, which supervisory approach is most effective over time?",
            "options": [
                "Providing direct instructions for every case and minimizing mentee input",
                "Regularly assigning complex cases without prior discussion or support",
                "Encouraging self-reflection through journaling, presenting their own case analyses, and engaging in peer consultation",
                "Limiting exposure to challenging cases until full competency is achieved, to prevent mistakes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Encouraging self-reflection, active case presentation, and peer consultation empowers mentees to develop their own analytical skills, build confidence in their judgments, and integrate theory with practice, which are crucial for autonomy and professional identity."

            "question": "When building and managing a professional supervision and mentoring program, which of the following is a crucial metric for evaluating the program's overall effectiveness and demonstrating its value to the organization and its stakeholders?",
            "options": [
                "The number of scheduled supervisory sessions per month",
                "The supervisor-to-mentee ratio within the program",
                "Mentee competency ratings, improvement in client outcome metrics, and mentee satisfaction with the program's support",
                "The total hours spent by supervisors in administrative meetings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective program evaluation focuses on outcomes and impact. Metrics like mentee competency, positive client outcomes (e.g., behavioral improvements in cats), and mentee satisfaction directly assess whether the program is achieving its goals of professional development and quality service delivery."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "While both involve guidance, a key distinction between <span class=\"highlight\">supervision</span> and <span class=\"highlight\">mentoring</span> in the professional context is that supervision often carries a formal evaluative component focused on client welfare and professional standards, whereas mentoring primarily focuses on:",
            "options": [
                "Enforcing strict adherence to organizational policies and procedures",
                "Providing remedial training for underperforming practitioners to correct deficiencies",
                "Fostering the mentee's long-term career development, broader professional identity, and navigating organizational culture",
                "Direct intervention in client cases when errors occur to prevent harm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mentoring typically has a broader scope, focusing on the mentee's overall career trajectory, professional identity formation, and personal growth within the profession, often with less formal evaluation than supervision. Supervision is more directly tied to case management and professional competence in specific roles."

            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "A supervisor is using the <span class=\"highlight\">Pendleton's Rules</span> feedback model to discuss a mentee's 'Sustain' stage of P.A.W.S., where client compliance with the long-term wellness plan has significantly dropped. Which of the following questions aligns with the \"What did you do well?\" component of Pendleton's model?",
            "options": [
                "\"What could you have done differently to prevent this issue from escalating?\"",
                "\"What aspects of your client communication or initial plan setup were effective in promoting compliance in the early stages?\"",
                "\"What is the primary reason for the client's current lack of compliance, in your opinion?\"",
                "\"What specific resources or strategies can we provide to improve client adherence going forward?\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendleton's Rules begin by asking the mentee 'What did you do well?' or 'What was good about the consultation?' This encourages self-affirmation and highlights strengths before moving to areas for improvement, creating a positive and constructive feedback environment. Option B directly addresses this by looking for past successes."
