            "question": "During the 'Profile & Preferences' phase (L2), a client expresses financial constraints regarding recommended environmental enrichment. As a Certified Cat Wellness Specialist, what is the most appropriate initial response to ensure client adherence and cat welfare?",
            "options": [
                "Insist on the original high-cost recommendations, emphasizing their importance for optimal wellness.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a financial aid program without further discussion.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective program design involves adapting to client realities. Exploring budget-friendly alternatives demonstrates empathy, fosters collaboration, and increases the likelihood of adherence, ultimately benefiting the cat's wellness within the client's means."

            "question": "A client reports their cat, 'Whiskers,' is exhibiting new onset inappropriate urination. After ruling out medical causes with a veterinarian, your assessment reveals significant changes in the home environment (new baby, reduced owner interaction, litter box in a high-traffic area). Which of the following best represents the *root cause* requiring intervention, as per Root Cause Analysis principles (L3)?",
            "options": [
                "The act of urinating outside the litter box.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The inappropriate urination is a symptom. While reduced owner attention is a factor, the root cause encompasses the broader environmental stressors and resulting insecurity, which are directly influenced by the changes and the litter box setup. Addressing these systemic issues is key to resolving the symptom."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A daily log provides detailed, quantitative, and qualitative data over time, allowing for objective analysis of changes in behavior patterns, identification of triggers, and assessment of intervention effectiveness. Subjective feelings or infrequent observations are less reliable."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Severe, unprovoked aggression, especially after initial interventions, often indicates a complex underlying issue that requires the expertise of a veterinary behaviorist. They can conduct a deeper medical and behavioral assessment, potentially integrate medication, and provide specialized behavior modification strategies beyond the scope of a wellness specialist."

                "Tell the client you can't help with medical issues and terminate the wellness program."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Certified Cat Wellness Specialists operate within a defined scope of practice that excludes veterinary diagnostics and prescribing medication.

            "question": "A recent meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) on feline stress reduction found that environmental enrichment (e.g., vertical space, puzzle feeders) consistently yielded a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">moderate to large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.65)</span> in reducing stress-related behaviors, while certain over-the-counter calming supplements showed inconsistent or negligible effects. When aligning interventions for a stressed cat (L3), what does this suggest about prioritization?",
            "options": [
                "All interventions are equally effective; personal preference should guide choices.",
                "Environmental enrichment should be considered a foundational, high-priority intervention due to strong evidence of efficacy.",
                "Over-the-counter calming supplements should always be tried first due to their accessibility.",
                "Evidence-based practice is irrelevant in individual cat wellness plans."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This statistic highlights the importance of evidence-based practice. A moderate to large effect size indicates that environmental enrichment is a highly effective intervention. Therefore, it should be prioritized as a foundational strategy, while less consistently effective options may be considered secondary or adjunctive."

            "question": "After implementing a new diet and enrichment plan for a cat with chronic mild obesity, weekly weigh-ins over two months show no significant weight loss, and the owner reports the cat is still largely sedentary. As per Monitoring, Evaluation, and Adjustment (L6), what is the most appropriate course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the plan for several more months, as weight loss is a slow process.",
                "Immediately revert to the cat's previous diet and abandon the enrichment efforts.",
                "Re-evaluate the current plan's components (e.g., caloric intake, enrichment effectiveness, owner adherence) and make data-driven adjustments.",
                "Conclude that the cat's obesity is purely genetic and cannot be managed through diet or exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When monitoring data indicates a lack of progress, it's crucial to re-evaluate the plan. This involves critically assessing all components, identifying potential barriers to success (e.g., inaccurate calorie counting, insufficient enrichment, or adherence issues), and making informed adjustments based on the collected data."
