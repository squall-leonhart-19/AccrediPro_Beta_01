            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A tiered pricing model that includes an early-bird discount is a highly effective strategy to incentivize early registration. It rewards proactive participants and creates a sense of urgency, encouraging sign-ups before the discount expires."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "During a virtual group session on feline enrichment, a participant consistently dominates the discussion, preventing others from contributing.

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Experiential learning is crucial for skill development. Role-playing or guided practice with props allows participants to actively 'rehearse' and apply the techniques for safe introductions in a low-stakes environment, solidifying their understanding and confidence."

Incorporating frequent interactive elements like polls, breakout rooms, and dedicated Q&A segments helps maintain participant attention, encourages active participation, and simulates the dynamic interaction of an in-person session, counteracting 'Zoom fatigue'."

                "Partnering with a generic pet supply store for promotion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developing an advanced program that addresses complex, niche issues like 'Complex Feline Anxiety' demonstrates specialization. This not only caters to a specific, often underserved market but also positions the specialist as an expert in a more advanced area, increasing perceived value and allowing for premium pricing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding body language is highly visual and nuanced. Using diverse video clips followed by guided discussion allows participants to observe, analyze, and interpret real-world examples, receiving immediate feedback and clarification, which is far more effective than just reading or memorizing terms."

            "explanation": "A strong value proposition clearly articulates the specific benefits a client will receive, the unique approach (expert-led, interactive), and the desired outcome (transform relationship, lasting trust). Options A, B, and D are too vague or merely descriptive, failing to convey true value."
