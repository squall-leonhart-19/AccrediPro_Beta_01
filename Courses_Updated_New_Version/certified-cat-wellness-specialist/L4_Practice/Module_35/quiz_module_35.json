            "question": "What is the primary distinction between business growth and business scaling in the context of a Certified Cat Wellness Specialist™ practice, as discussed in L1: Foundations of Scaling?",
            "options": [
                "Growth primarily involves increasing revenue; scaling focuses on increasing revenue disproportionately to the increase in operational costs.",
                "Growth means expanding into new physical locations; scaling means acquiring more advanced wellness equipment.",
                "Growth is a short-term objective focused on client satisfaction; scaling is a long-term strategy for market dominance.",
                "Growth necessitates hiring more staff for every new client; scaling allows for the same staff to serve a larger client base with improved efficiency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As covered in L1, business growth often implies a proportional increase in costs with revenue. Scaling, however, is characterized by increasing revenue at a significantly faster rate than the corresponding increase in operational expenses, often through leveraging systems and technology."
