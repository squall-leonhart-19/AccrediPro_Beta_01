                "Publicly denounce the colleague on social media to warn others.",

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "During a home visit, you observe that a client's cat, 'Whiskers,' appears significantly underweight and has matted fur, despite the client claiming they provide excellent care. The client specifically asked you not to share any observations with their veterinarian due to a previous disagreement. Balancing <span class=\"highlight\">confidentiality and cat welfare</span> (L3, L4), what is your ethical obligation?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While confidentiality is important, it is superseded by the ethical obligation to protect animal welfare. The first step is to address the concerns directly and professionally with the client, advocating for the cat's needs. If neglect is evident and the client is unwilling to act, reporting to authorities becomes a necessary ethical step."

As a professional committed to <span class=\"highlight\">evidence-based practice and continuous development</span> (L5, L8), what is your ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Continue recommending the toy, as clients like it and it causes no harm.",
                "Disregard the study, as it contradicts your personal experience and observations.",
