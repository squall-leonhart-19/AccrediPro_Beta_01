            "question": "A client presents with chronic pain and inflammation. An advanced aromatherapist seeks to create a synergistic blend leveraging both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Which chemical interaction mechanism is most likely to enhance the overall therapeutic effect beyond the sum of individual oils?",
            "options": [
                "Agonism, where constituents bind to the same receptor, amplifying response.",
                "Antagonism, where constituents block each other's less desirable effects.",
                "Permeation enhancement, where one constituent improves the dermal absorption of others.",
                "Chelation, where constituents bind to metal ions, improving stability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synergistic blending often involves constituents working through different pathways or enhancing each other's bioavailability. Permeation enhancement, where one component like limonene or 1,8-cineole can increase the dermal absorption of other active constituents, is a common and powerful synergistic mechanism, amplifying the overall therapeutic effect."
