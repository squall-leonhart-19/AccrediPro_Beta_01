            "question": "When optimizing aromatic diffusion in a shared clinical setting, which type of diffuser is generally <em>least</em> recommended for extended therapeutic use due to its potential to alter essential oil chemical profiles and reduce therapeutic efficacy?",
            "options": ["Ultrasonic diffuser", "Nebulizing diffuser", "Evaporative fan diffuser", "Heat diffuser"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Heat diffusers can degrade the volatile compounds of essential oils through thermal stress, potentially altering their therapeutic properties and aroma. Ultrasonic and nebulizing diffusers are preferred for therapeutic applications."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To achieve a 2% dilution in 30 mL, you need 0.6 mL of essential oil (0.02 * 30 mL). With 20 drops per mL, this equates to 12 drops (0.6 mL * 20 drops/mL)."
