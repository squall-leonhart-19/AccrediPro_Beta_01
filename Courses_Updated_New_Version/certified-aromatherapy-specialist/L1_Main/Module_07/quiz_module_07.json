            "question": "Which essential oil is widely recognized for its anxiolytic properties, primarily attributed to its interaction with GABA receptors in the central nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Peppermint (Mentha piperita)",
                "Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is well-documented for its calming and anxiolytic effects, largely due to its constituents linalool and linalyl acetate, which are believed to modulate GABAergic neurotransmission, leading to reduced neuronal excitability."

            "question": "A client reports symptoms consistent with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), including mood swings and mild bloating. Which essential oil, known for its potential to support hormonal balance, might be considered with appropriate caution and client consultation?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clary Sage (Salvia sclarea) is often considered for hormonal support, particularly for symptoms related to the menstrual cycle, due to its estrogen-like compounds, notably sclareol. It should always be used with caution and thorough client assessment for contraindications."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis ct. verbenone)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Rosemary chemotypes, particularly ct. verbenone and ct. camphor, are generally contraindicated during pregnancy due to their potential emmenagogic (menstrual flow stimulating) and abortifacient properties, as well as their stimulatory effects. Lemon and Spearmint are generally considered safer options for nausea in pregnancy, though always with professional consultation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synergy in aromatherapy blending describes the principle where the therapeutic effect of a combination of essential oils is enhanced beyond what each oil could achieve individually, often due to their complementary chemical constituents and diverse mechanisms of action."

            "question": "A 6-year-old child presents with mild seasonal congestion.

Milder options like Frankincense, Tea Tree (diluted), or Sweet Orange are generally preferred for children."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary therapeutic routes for essential oils are topical application (where constituents are absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream) and inhalation (where volatile molecules interact with olfactory receptors and the limbic system, and also enter the bloodstream via the lungs), leading to systemic and localized effects."
