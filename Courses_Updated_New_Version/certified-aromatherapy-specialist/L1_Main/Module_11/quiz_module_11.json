            "question": "The process of <span class=\"highlight\">hydrodistillation</span> is a common method for extracting essential oils from plant material. Which of the following best describes a key characteristic or outcome of this specific extraction technique?",
            "options": [
                "It uses high pressure and low temperature to yield a solvent-free extract known as a CO2 extract.",
                "The plant material is fully submerged in water, which is then boiled to release volatile compounds, with the essential oil separating from the hydrosol.",
                "It involves mechanically pressing the rind of citrus fruits to obtain the oil, resulting in a cold-pressed essential oil.",
                "It requires chemical solvents like hexane or ethanol to separate the essential oil from the plant material, producing an absolute or concrete."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hydrodistillation involves submerging the plant material directly in water within a still and boiling it. The steam carries the volatile essential oil compounds, which are then condensed. The essential oil separates from the hydrosol (aromatic water) after cooling, distinguishing it from steam distillation where steam passes through the plant material."
