            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An advanced client assessment, especially for complex conditions, moves beyond mere symptom management to a holistic understanding.

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the hierarchy of evidence, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) provide the highest level of evidence. They synthesize data from well-designed studies, minimizing bias and increasing generalizability, which is crucial for evidence-based practice."

            "question": "A Master Practitioner is formulating a blend for a client experiencing both acute inflammatory pain and muscle spasm. They decide to combine German Chamomile (rich in chamazulene) with Lavender (rich in linalool and linalyl acetate) and Marjoram (rich in sabinene hydrate). This combination aims to leverage which principle of advanced blend formulation?",

This aims to enhance therapeutic outcomes beyond what individual oils might achieve."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For clients on prescription medications, especially those with potential organ toxicity like methotrexate (which can affect the liver), understanding and avoiding essential oils with potential drug interactions or cumulative organ burden (e.g., hepatotoxic oils) is paramount for client safety.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For any application, especially those outside typical recommendations or carrying higher risk, comprehensive informed consent is crucial.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developing a master-level niche involves specializing in a particular area.

            "question": "A 65-year-old client with diabetic neuropathy experiences chronic burning pain in their feet. The Master Practitioner is formulating a topical blend.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phenols and certain ketones are known to be neurotoxic and can potentially lower the seizure threshold, making them contraindications or requiring extreme caution in individuals with a history of seizures. Esters, monoterpenes, and alcohols are generally considered safer in this context when properly diluted."
