            "options": [
                "Supervision primarily focuses on competency assurance and client safety, while mentoring emphasizes career development and specialization.",
                "Supervision is always mandatory and formal, whereas mentoring is typically informal and optional.",
                "Mentoring requires a licensed practitioner, while supervision can be provided by any experienced aromatherapist.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clinical supervision is fundamentally about ensuring practitioner competency, ethical practice, and client safety. Mentoring, while also supporting development, has a broader scope, often focusing on career advancement, networking, and achieving specific professional goals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive supervisory contract sets the foundation for a transparent, ethical, and effective relationship. It clarifies boundaries, expectations, and the framework for supervision, crucial for trust and professional conduct."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "A supervisee reveals during a session that they have started a business partnership with a client they previously worked with. According to L5 on ethical dilemmas, what is the supervisor's most appropriate initial action?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately terminate the supervisory relationship due to an ethical breach.",
                "Advise the supervisee to sever the business relationship with the client immediately.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships, especially those involving former clients, pose significant ethical risks. The supervisor's role is to guide the supervisee through an ethical decision-making process, helping them understand the implications, potential harm, and explore corrective actions, rather than immediate punitive measures."

            "question": "Bernard's Discrimination Model of supervision, discussed in L2, posits that a supervisor's focus should 'discriminate' between three primary areas. Which of the following is NOT one of these areas?",

                "Process (therapeutic interventions and techniques)",
                "Conceptualization (understanding the client and case dynamics)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bernard's model focuses on three areas: Process (intervention skills), Conceptualization (case understanding), and Professionalism (the supervisee's professional self and ethical practice). While a supervisee's personal issues might indirectly impact practice, direct focus on unrelated personal issues is outside the scope of clinical supervision under this model, unless directly impeding professional competence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
