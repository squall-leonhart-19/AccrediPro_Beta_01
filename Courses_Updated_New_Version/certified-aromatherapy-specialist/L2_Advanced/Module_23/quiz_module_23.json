            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Any product containing a water phase (like a lotion or cream) is susceptible to microbial growth (bacteria, mold, yeast). A broad-spectrum preservative is essential to inhibit this growth, ensuring product safety and extending its shelf life. Antioxidants protect oils from oxidation, emulsifiers blend oil and water, and chelating agents bind metal ions, but none address microbial contamination as directly as a preservative (L7)."

            "question": "In a clinical setting where an aromatherapy specialist collaborates with other healthcare professionals, using the SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note format is crucial. For an aromatherapy intervention, where would a client's reported reduction in anxiety after an inhalation session be documented?",
            "options": [
                "Subjective",
                "Objective",
                "Assessment",
                "Plan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Subjective' section of a SOAP note is where the client's direct statements, complaints, and reported experiences are documented. A client's reported reduction in anxiety is a subjective experience, directly communicated by them (L8)."

            "question": "When considering topical essential oil application for infants under six months of age, what is the primary physiological reason for extreme caution and generally recommending avoidance?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of phototoxicity due to thin skin",
                "Their highly developed olfactory system is easily overwhelmed",
                "Immature liver and kidney function impairs metabolism and excretion, increasing systemic absorption risk",
                "Higher likelihood of allergic reactions compared to adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Infants under six months have immature liver and kidney function, which means their bodies are less efficient at metabolizing and excreting essential oil compounds. This immaturity, combined with their thinner skin and higher skin-to-body surface area ratio, significantly increases the risk of systemic absorption and potential toxicity, making topical application generally contraindicated (L6)."
