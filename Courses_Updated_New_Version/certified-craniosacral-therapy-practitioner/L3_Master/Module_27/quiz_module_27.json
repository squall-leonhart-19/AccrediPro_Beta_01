            "question": "In neonatal pediatric CST, which anatomical structure is most frequently addressed to resolve breastfeeding difficulties such as poor latch or weak suck?",
            "options": [
                "The sagittal suture",
                "The occipital condyles and the hypoglossal canal (CN XII)",
                "The frontal eminence",
                "The zygomatic arch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compression of the occipital condyles during birth can impinge the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), which controls tongue movement, directly impacting an infant's ability to latch and suck effectively."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, what is the primary clinical objective of CST regarding the pelvic diaphragm?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the rigidity of the pelvic floor for support",
                "To induce early labor through sacral manipulation",
                "To ensure mobility and balance in the pelvis to facilitate optimal fetal positioning",
                "To reduce the production of relaxin hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CST aims to balance the pelvic and respiratory diaphragms, ensuring the sacrum and pelvic bones have the mobility required for the fetus to descend and rotate correctly for birth."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In geriatric applications, CST is utilized to support 'Glymphatic Clearance.' What does this process involve?",
            "options": [
                "The regeneration of peripheral nerve endings in the feet",
                "The removal of metabolic waste products, such as amyloid-beta, from the brain via CSF flow",
                "The increasing of bone mineral density in the cranium",
                "The stimulation of digestive enzymes in the gut-brain axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is a waste clearance pathway in the central nervous system that utilizes CSF to flush out toxins; CST enhances the rhythmic flow necessary for this clearance, which is vital for cognitive health in aging populations."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "According to the Somato-Emotional Release (SER) framework, what constitutes an 'Energy Cyst'?",
            "options": [
                "A malignant growth within the fascia",
                "A localized area of high-frequency vibration",
                "A localized area of disorganized energy and restricted tissue resulting from unresolved physical or emotional trauma",
                "A pocket of excess cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An Energy Cyst is a concept in SER where the body 'walls off' the energy of a trauma it cannot dissipate, leading to localized tissue dysfunction and potential emotional triggers during manual release."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "When addressing TMJ disorders (TMD) through intra-oral specialization, why is the Sphenoid bone considered a 'key' structure?",
            "options": [
                "It serves as the attachment point for the masseter muscle",
                "It articulates with the mandible directly",
                "Its position influences the alignment of the maxilla and the tension of the pterygoid muscles",
                "It is the only bone in the skull that does not move during the CSR"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The sphenoid's alignment dictates the mechanics of the entire cranium; if it is torqued, it affects the maxilla and the pterygoid muscles, which are central to TMJ function and dysfunction."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In the context of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and neurological recovery, what is the primary purpose of inducing a 'Stillpoint'?",
            "options": [
                "To stop the heart rate temporarily for deep rest",
                "To allow the autonomic nervous system to shift from sympathetic dominance to parasympathetic repair",
                "To increase intracranial pressure to stimulate neurons",
                "To measure the exact volume of CSF in the ventricles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint causes a momentary suspension of the Craniosacral Rhythm, which triggers a 'system reboot' of the autonomic nervous system, moving the patient out of a 'fight or flight' state common in TBI."

                "Instantly repair torn ligaments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CST facilitates deep relaxation and lowers systemic inflammation by reducing cortisol, which accelerates physiological recovery and improves sleep quality, essential for athletic performance."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In Palliative Care and End-of-Life support, what is the 'therapeutic intent' of a CST practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "To attempt a curative reversal of the terminal condition",
                "To provide comfort, reduce terminal agitation, and facilitate a peaceful transition",
                "To perform vigorous adjustments to keep the patient awake",
                "To replace all pharmaceutical pain management with manual therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal in palliative care is not curative; it is to provide a gentle, supportive presence that eases physical pain and emotional distress, allowing for a more dignified and peaceful end-of-life experience."

                "Abducens Nerve (CN VI)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve (CN X) exits the skull through the jugular foramen; compression in this area is a common contributor to infant colic, reflux, and digestive upset."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A client presenting with chronic PTSD experiences 'unwinding' (spontaneous movement) during a session. According to SER protocols, the practitioner should:",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the session and call for medical assistance",
                "Physically restrain the client to prevent movement",
                "Support the client's body parts in their movement, maintaining a safe and neutral 'holding' presence",
                "Tell the client to stop moving so the rhythm can be palpated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unwinding is a natural part of Somato-Emotional Release; the practitioner's role is to follow and support the movement safely, allowing the body to complete the discharge of stored traumatic energy."
