            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "P.U.L.S.E. stands for Prioritization, Underlying Physiological Drivers, Longitudinal Goals, Sequencing, and Evaluation. Identifying drivers ensures the root cause is addressed rather than just symptoms."

            "question": "During advanced intake for a complex neurological case, why is it recommended to use the 'Timeline Mapping' technique?",
            "options": [
                "To determine the exact date of practice discharge",
                "To correlate physical symptoms with historical stressors and trauma events",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Timeline mapping allows the practitioner to see the intersection of physical injuries, emotional stressors, and the onset of craniosacral restrictions over the client's lifespan."

                "Telling the client the PCP does not understand the craniosacral system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional collaboration requires clear communication using clinical language and validated tools (like the Migraine Disability Assessment/MIDAS) to bridge the gap between modalities."

            "id": "q26_4",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The CV-4 (Compression of the Fourth Ventricle) or Stillpoint Induction facilitates fluid exchange and has been shown to support the glymphatic system's role in metabolic waste clearance from the brain."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "A Trauma-Informed Program Design (Lesson 5) prioritizes 'Titration.' What does this mean for the clinical application of CST?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a core trauma-informed principle that ensures the client's nervous system is not overwhelmed by too much 'material' (physical or emotional) at once."

            "id": "q26_6",

                "The need for deep, high-velocity adjustments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Geriatric populations often have thinner dural membranes and decreased bone density; therefore, the practitioner must use extremely light touch and avoid aggressive positioning."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on Outcome Measurement, which tool is considered a 'Patient-Reported Outcome Measure' (PROM)?",

            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'CST Intensives.' What is a primary clinical benefit of an intensive format (e.g., 2 sessions/day for 4 days)?",
            "options": [
                "It is cheaper for the client than weekly sessions",
                "It bypasses the 'plateau' effect by maintaining therapeutic momentum and cumulative neurological down-regulation",
                "It allows the practitioner to take more vacations",
                "It eliminates the need for any home-care exercises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intensives provide a concentrated therapeutic window that can shift chronic patterns more effectively than sessions spaced far apart, as the nervous system stays in a 'corrective' state."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "If data-driven adjustments (Lesson 7) show a 'Global Rating of Change' (GRC) of -1 or -2 after three sessions, what is the appropriate action?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A negative GRC indicates the client feels worse. This necessitates a 'Pivot' in the program design, involving a re-assessment of the treatment plan and primary lesions."

            "id": "q26_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
