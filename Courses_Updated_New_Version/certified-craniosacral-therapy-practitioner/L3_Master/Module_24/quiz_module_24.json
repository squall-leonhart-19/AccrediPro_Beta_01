            "question": "When palpating the 'Long Tide' (Primary Respiratory Mechanism), what is the typical rhythmic frequency observed by a Master Practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "8 to 12 cycles per minute",
                "2.5 cycles per minute",
                "Approximately 1 cycle every 100 seconds",
                "1 cycle every 5 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Long Tide is a slow, stable rhythm of approximately 0.6 cycles per minute (or one cycle every 100 seconds), distinct from the faster Cranial Rhythm Impulse (CRI) and the Mid-Tide."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "In advanced myofascial unwinding, a 'multi-vector release' is characterized by which of the following practitioner actions?",
            "options": [
                "Applying forceful pressure against the direction of tissue resistance",
                "Following the tissue's inherent motion into the 'ease' across multiple planes simultaneously",
                "Restricting all movement until a 'pop' is felt in the fascia",
                "Focusing solely on the longitudinal axis of the limb"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multi-vector release involves following the tissue's inherent intelligence into the direction of least resistance (the ease) across various three-dimensional planes, allowing the system to self-correct."

        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of maintaining 'Therapeutic Neutrality' during a master-level session?",
            "options": [
                "To remain emotionally detached and cold toward the client's experience",
                "To provide a non-judgmental fulcrum that allows the client's system to reorganize without practitioner interference",
                "To ensure the practitioner does not get tired during long sessions",
                "To prevent the client from talking during the treatment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic Neutrality is a state of presence where the practitioner has no 'agenda' to fix, allowing the client's inherent health to emerge and direct the healing process."

        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "The CV4 (Compression of the Fourth Ventricle) technique is primarily used to achieve which systemic effect?",
            "options": [
                "To temporarily increase sympathetic nervous system activity",
                "To encourage a stillpoint that enhances the potency of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)",
                "To manually stretch the tentorium cerebelli",
                "To increase the heart rate of a lethargic client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CV4 technique encourages a stillpoint, which helps to 'pool' potency and allows the system to reset, often resulting in enhanced fluid dynamics and systemic relaxation."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "According to the Polyvagal Approach in Lesson 5, which state must be activated to facilitate deep healing and social engagement?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal complex (shutdown)",
                "The Sympathetic-Adrenal axis (fight or flight)",
                "The Ventral Vagal complex (social engagement system)",
                "The Myofascial Binding state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' branch of the nervous system. Deep therapeutic work is most effective when the client is anchored in this state of physiological safety."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "A 'Vertical Strain' of the Sphenobasilar Synchondrosis (SBS) is identified when:",
            "options": [
                "The sphenoid and occiput rotate in the same direction around two transverse axes",
                "The sphenoid and occiput rotate in opposite directions around a longitudinal axis",
                "The base of the sphenoid moves superiorly or inferiorly in relation to the base of the occiput",
                "The sphenoid bone becomes stuck in permanent extension"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A vertical strain is a non-physiological shearing motion where the base of the sphenoid moves superiorly (Superior Strain) or inferiorly (Inferior Strain) relative to the base of the occiput."

        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "In the context of Energy Dynamics, what does the term 'Potency' specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The physical strength used by the practitioner during a hold",
                "The inherent organizing force of the 'Breath of Life' expressed within the fluids",
                "The amount of pressure measured in the dural venous sinuses",
                "The client's cognitive ability to understand the therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Potency is the bio-electric/bio-magnetic ordering force that resides within the cerebrospinal fluid and the 'Fluid Body,' acting as the blueprint for health."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a critical contraindication for performing an EV4 (Expansion of the Fourth Ventricle) or CV4 technique?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic muscular tension in the neck",
                "Acute intracranial hemorrhage or head trauma",
                "Mild anxiety or stress",
                "Post-operative recovery after 6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Any technique that alters intracranial pressure or fluid flow, such as CV4 or EV4, is strictly contraindicated in cases of acute head injury, hemorrhage, or aneurysm."

        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "During a session, a 'Holistic Shift' is recognized by the practitioner when:",
            "options": [
                "The client decides to end the session early",
                "The system transitions from fragmented, localized patterns to a unified, rhythmic expression of the Tide",
                "The practitioner moves from the cranium to the sacrum",
                "The client experiences a sudden increase in heart rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Holistic Shift is a master-level observation where the client's system stops 'working' on individual issues and moves into a unified state of balance and systemic integration."

        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between the Mid-Tide and the Long Tide in clinical practice?",
            "options": [
                "The Mid-Tide is faster (approx. 2.5 cycles/min) and carries more 'biographical' information, while the Long Tide is slower and more foundational",
                "The Mid-Tide is only felt in the feet, while the Long Tide is felt in the head",
                "The Long Tide is a pathological rhythm, while the Mid-Tide is healthy",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Mid-Tide (approx. 2.5 cpm) is where we often encounter the client's history and trauma patterns. The Long Tide (approx. 0.6 cpm) is a deeper, more 'transpersonal' rhythm of inherent health."
