            "id": "q29_1",
            "question": "In the transition from technical proficiency to 'Therapeutic Presence' (L1), what is the primary role of the practitioner's intuition?",
            "options": [
                "To replace anatomical knowledge with purely energetic sensing",
                "To recognize the 'emergence of the primary lesion' through non-linear listening",
                "To speed up the session by skipping the initial P.U.L.S.E. assessment",
                "To direct the client's unwinding toward a specific emotional outcome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves using intuition to identify the 'primary lesion' or the system's inherent priority, rather than following a rigid, linear protocol."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "Advanced P.U.L.S.E. Synthesis (L2) differs from foundational application primarily because it:",
            "options": [
                "Focuses exclusively on the sacral pump",
                "Utilizes a 'Non-Linear' approach that follows the system's inherent treatment plan",
                "Requires a minimum of 20 pounds of pressure to reach deep fascia",
                "Is only applicable to pediatric patients with acute trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced synthesis moves away from fixed sequences and instead prioritizes the system's own self-corrective sequence, often referred to as the inherent treatment plan."

        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "During a Somato-Emotional unwinding process (L3), if a client enters a 'Therapeutic Alarm' state (sympathetic surge), what is the practitioner's most effective action?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately end the session to prevent re-traumatization",
                "Increase physical pressure to ground the client's physical body",
                "Maintain a 'Neutral Anchor' and provide a stable, non-judgmental container",
                "Verbally direct the client to suppress the emotion and focus on breathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery in somato-emotional work requires the practitioner to remain a 'neutral anchor,' providing a safe container that allows the system to process the surge without being overwhelmed."

            "id": "q29_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data indicates that integrated CST protocols can reduce salivary cortisol by approximately 31% in chronic stress cases, signaling a significant shift in the endocrine-immune axis."

            "id": "q29_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Global Stillpoint facilitates a systemic neuro-reset, marked by the shift into the ventral vagal state (parasympathetic), which supports deep tissue repair and neurological regulation."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, the 'Pivot Point' strategy for complex or 'stuck' cases suggests that when a restriction does not release, the practitioner should:",

                "Wait at the same site for at least 45 minutes without moving"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pivot Point strategy involves addressing distal but related restrictions that may be anchoring the 'stuck' pattern, allowing the primary restriction to resolve indirectly."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Long Tide is a slow, rhythmic movement of the energetic field, typically cycling at a rate of 1.5 to 2.5 cycles per minute, distinct from the faster Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI)."

            "id": "q29_8",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery is characterized by the 'Wide Perceptual Field,' where the practitioner remains aware of the whole system and the environment while maintaining specific physical contact."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For complex cranial cases like migraines, integrating regional stillpoints with venous sinus drainage addresses both the fluid and the structural components of the restriction."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bio-Dynamic presence recognizes the energetic field as a real, perceptible extension of the system that carries the 'blueprint' for health and can be influenced through practitioner presence."
