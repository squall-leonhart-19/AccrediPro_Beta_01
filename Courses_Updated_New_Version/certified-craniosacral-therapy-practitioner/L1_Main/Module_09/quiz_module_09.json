            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "The Sphenobasilar Synchondrosis (SBS) is considered the 'keystone' of cranial mechanics. Anatomically, which two bones form this junction?",
            "options": [
                "The anterior aspect of the Sphenoid and the Ethmoid bone",
                "The posterior body of the Sphenoid and the basilar part of the Occiput",
                "The greater wings of the Sphenoid and the Temporal squama",
                "The lesser wings of the Sphenoid and the Frontal bone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SBS is the cartilaginous joint formed by the junction of the posterior body of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occiput."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "During the Flexion phase of the Cranial Sacral Rhythm, how do the Greater Wings of the Sphenoid move in relation to the practitioner's hands?",
            "options": [
                "They move superiorly and medially",
                "They move posterior and superior",
                "They move anterior, inferior, and lateral",
                "They move posterior, inferior, and medial"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In flexion, the base of the sphenoid rises (superiorly), which causes the greater wings to rotate anteriorly, inferiorly, and laterally (widening the vault)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A student palpates a 'Right Torsion' at the SBS. Which palpatory finding confirms this physiological strain?",
            "options": [
                "The right greater wing of the sphenoid feels higher (more superior) than the left",
                "The left greater wing of the sphenoid feels higher (more superior) than the right",
                "The entire sphenoid is shifted to the right of the midline",
                "The occiput is rotating clockwise while the sphenoid remains stationary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A torsion is named for the greater wing of the sphenoid that is more superior. In a Right Torsion, the right greater wing moves superiorly while the left moves inferiorly."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In a Side-Bending Rotation (SBR) strain, the practitioner notes a 'fullness' or 'convexity' on the left side of the cranium. What does this indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The left side is the restricted side and is 'stuck' in extension",
                "The left side is the convex side, where the bones are moving more easily into flexion",
                "The right side is the convex side, and the left is concave",
                "The sphenoid and occiput are rotating in opposite directions around a longitudinal axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In SBR, the side of convexity (the side that feels fuller and wider) is the side where the sphenoid and occiput have spread apart, facilitating the flexion phase on that side."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark characteristic of a 'Non-Physiological' SBS strain, such as a Vertical or Lateral Shear?",
            "options": [
                "They are usually caused by internal metabolic factors",
                "They enhance the vitality of the Cranial Sacral Rhythm",
                "The sphenoid and occiput rotate in opposite directions around the same axis",
                "They are typically the result of external trauma and 'shackle' the rhythm, making it difficult to palpate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Non-physiological strains (shears and compressions) are usually traumatic in origin and significantly impair the Cranial Sacral Rhythm, often feeling 'stiff' or 'blocked' to the practitioner."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "A 'Superior Vertical Shear' is defined by which specific movement at the SBS junction?",
            "options": [
                "The base of the sphenoid moves superiorly relative to the base of the occiput",
                "The base of the sphenoid moves inferiorly relative to the base of the occiput",
                "The sphenoid rotates anteriorly while the occiput rotates posteriorly",
                "The sphenoid and occiput both move superiorly in unison"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vertical shears are named for the position of the base of the sphenoid. In a Superior Vertical Shear, the sphenoid base moves superiorly relative to the occipital basilar process."

        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "When addressing the SBS-Dural connection, which part of the Reciprocal Tension Membrane (RTM) is most directly influenced by SBS flexion and extension?",
            "options": [
                "The Falx Cerebri",
                "The Tentorium Cerebelli",
                "The Diaphragma Sellae",
                "The Falx Cerebelli"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Tentorium Cerebelli is attached to the clinoid processes of the sphenoid and the petrous ridges of the temporal bones, making it highly sensitive to SBS dynamics."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "During the induction of an SBS Stillpoint, the practitioner follows the rhythm to its end-range and then 'resists' the return. What is the primary clinical indicator that a Stillpoint has been achieved?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in the heart rate of the client",
                "A 'softening' or 'melting' sensation in the cranial tissues followed by a temporary cessation of the rhythm",
                "The client begins to breathe rapidly (tachypnea)",
                "The cranial bones become hard and rigid like stone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint is characterized by a palpable softening of the tissues and a pause in the CSR, often accompanied by a deep sigh or therapeutic relaxation response from the client."

        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "In a 'Lateral Shear,' the practitioner's hands feel the cranium shifting into the shape of a parallelogram. This occurs because the sphenoid and occiput are rotating in the same direction around which axes?",
            "options": [
                "One AP (Anterior-Posterior) axis",
                "Two transverse axes",
                "Two parallel vertical axes",
                "One vertical axis and one longitudinal axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lateral shears occur when the sphenoid and occiput rotate in the same direction around two parallel vertical axes, creating a 'sideways' shearing motion at the SBS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "Clinical Protocol: When treating a client with chronic 'brain fog' and a history of a 'whiplash' injury, which SBS dysfunction is most commonly suspected?",
            "options": [
                "SBS Flexion Lesion",
                "SBS Torsion",
                "SBS Compression",
                "SBS Extension Lesion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SBS Compression, where the sphenoid and occiput are forced together, is a common result of trauma (like whiplash) and is clinically associated with low vitality, headaches, and 'brain fog'."
