            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Within the proprietary P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, what does the 'P' represent as the foundational first step of an assessment?",
            "options": ["Presence", "Palpation", "Pulsation", "Pressure"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The P.U.L.S.E. Framework™ begins with Palpation (P), the art of tactile assessment to detect the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse and tissue restrictions."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Which layer of the dural membrane system is described as the 'tough mother' and is responsible for forming the dural tube that surrounds the spinal cord?",
            "options": ["Pia Mater", "Arachnoid Mater", "Dura Mater", "Subarachnoid Space"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dura Mater is the outermost, toughest layer of the meninges, providing the primary structural integrity for the Craniosacral system."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In the study of CSF Dynamics, the 'Third Circulation' refers to the movement of fluid produced primarily in which structure?",
            "options": ["Arachnoid Villi", "Choroid Plexus", "Sagittal Sinus", "Foramen of Magendie"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Choroid Plexus, located within the ventricles of the brain, is the primary site of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) production."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A healthy adult typically exhibits a Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI) frequency within which range?",
            "options": ["2-4 cycles per minute", "6-12 cycles per minute", "15-20 cycles per minute", "60-80 cycles per minute"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard physiological rate for the CRI in a healthy, resting adult is generally accepted as 6 to 12 cycles per minute."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "During the 'Listening' (L) phase of the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, what is the primary purpose of the practitioner maintaining a 'neutral' state?",
            "options": ["To apply corrective mechanical force", "To prevent the practitioner's own energetic 'noise' from influencing the client's system", "To increase the rate of CSF production through intention", "To diagnose specific vertebral subluxations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic presence and neutrality ensure that the practitioner is a witness to the client's internal corrective processes rather than an imposer of external force."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "The 'Unwinding' (U) process in myofascial release is often accompanied by which physiological 'signpost' indicating a release of stored tension?",
            "options": ["Significant drop in skin temperature", "A therapeutic pulse, heat release, or softening of tissues", "Immediate muscle atrophy in the affected area", "A sudden increase in heart rate above 120 BPM"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As tissues 'unwind' and release stored kinetic energy or trauma, practitioners frequently palpate heat, a therapeutic pulse, or a palpable softening of the fascia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological characteristic of a 'Stillpoint' (S) during a Craniosacral session?",
            "options": ["A rapid acceleration of the CRI to clear toxins", "A temporary cessation or pause of the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse", "An increase in sympathetic nervous system dominance", "The physical realignment of the sphenobasilar synchondrosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint is a therapeutic pause where the CRI stops momentarily, allowing the central nervous system to reset and reorganize."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "The 'Equilibrium' (E) phase of the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™ is focused on which of the following outcomes?",
            "options": ["Inducing a state of acute inflammatory response", "Integration of changes and restoration of systemic homeostasis", "Breaking down adhesions through deep tissue friction", "Concluding the session without a re-assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Equilibrium is the final stage of the framework, ensuring that the changes achieved during the session are integrated and the body returns to a state of balance."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "The Reciprocal Tension Membrane (RTM) system is composed of the continuity between the Falx Cerebri, Tentorium Cerebelli, and which other structure?",
            "options": ["The Diaphragm", "The Spinal Dura (Dural Tube)", "The Linea Alba", "The Plantar Fascia"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RTM describes the continuous intracranial and intraspinal membrane system, where tension in one area (like the Falx) is reflected throughout the system down to the sacrum via the dural tube."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "If a practitioner palpates a CRI with very 'low amplitude' (weak movement), this clinical finding most likely suggests:",
            "options": ["High vital reserves and excellent health", "A state of low vitality, chronic exhaustion, or high systemic stress", "The client is in a peak athletic state", "The session should be terminated immediately due to contraindications"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low amplitude of the CRI often correlates with depleted vitality, chronic illness, or a system that is overwhelmed by stress and unable to express its full rhythmic potency."
