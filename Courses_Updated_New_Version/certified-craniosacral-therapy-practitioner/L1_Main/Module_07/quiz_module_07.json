            "question": "According to the 'Pressure Stat Model' discussed in Lesson 3, what occurs during the 'filling phase' of the Craniosacral System?",
            "options": [
                "Cerebrospinal fluid production exceeds the rate of resorption, causing a rise in intracranial pressure.",
                "Cerebrospinal fluid resorption exceeds the rate of production, leading to dural tube contraction.",
                "The choroid plexus stops production entirely to allow for dural expansion.",
                "The arachnoid granulations close to prevent the loss of fluid into the venous sinuses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Pressure Stat Model suggests that the 'filling phase' occurs when CSF production at the choroid plexus exceeds the rate of resorption, leading to the expansion of the system (Flexion)."

            "question": "A practitioner palpating the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI) notes a rate of 9 cycles per minute. Based on the data in Lesson 2, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Tachycardic; the rhythm is dangerously fast and requires immediate CV-4 induction.",
                "Pathological; any rhythm under 10 cycles per minute indicates severe dural restriction.",
                "Normal; the standard healthy range for the CRI is 6 to 12 cycles per minute.",
                "Slow; a healthy CRI should always match the respiratory rate of 12-20 breaths per minute."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The standard physiological range for the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI) is 6 to 12 cycles per minute, distinct from heart rate and respiration."

            "options": [
                "One hand under the occiput, the other over the pubic symphysis.",
                "One hand under the sacrum, the other over the lower abdomen/pubic symphysis.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transverse diaphragm releases utilize a 'sandwich' technique; for the pelvis, the sacrum and the pubic symphysis/lower abdomen are the primary contact points."

            "question": "During a CV-4 (Compression of the Fourth Ventricle) induction, what is the primary goal of the practitioner's hand movement during the extension phase of the CRI?",
            "options": [
                "To encourage the occiput to move into flexion as quickly as possible.",
                "To resist the next flexion cycle, following the narrowing occiput into extension and holding it there.",
                "To apply vigorous upward pressure to the atlas (C1) to increase CSF flow.",
                "To pull the parietal bones apart to relieve intracranial pressure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CV-4 technique involves following the occiput into extension (narrowing) and gently resisting the return to flexion, which encourages a 'Stillpoint'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Parietal Lift is specifically designed to create space and movement at the sagittal suture and to lift the parietal bones away from the tentorium cerebelli."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, 'U' stands for Unwinding, where the practitioner follows the tissue's inherent movement to resolve stored tension."

            "question": "During the 'Flexion' phase of the Craniosacral rhythm, how does the physical body typically respond?",
            "options": [
                "The body rotates internally, becomes longer, and narrows.",
                "The body rotates externally, becomes shorter, and widens.",
                "The body enters a state of sympathetic 'fight or flight' activation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flexion is characterized by external rotation of the paired bones, a widening of the body, and a slight shortening of the vertical axis."

            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights the hyoid bone as unique in the human body. Why is it significant in Craniosacral Therapy?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only bone that does not articulate with any other bone, serving as a 'floating' anchor for anterior neck fascia.",
                "It is the primary attachment point for the dural tube within the cervical spine.",
                "It acts as the 'master switch' for the production of cerebrospinal fluid.",
                "It directly articulates with the C3 vertebra to stabilize the airway."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The hyoid is unique because it has no bony articulations; it is suspended by muscles and ligaments, making it a key indicator of tension in the throat and floor of the mouth."
