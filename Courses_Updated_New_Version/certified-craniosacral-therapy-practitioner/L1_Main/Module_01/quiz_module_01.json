            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "In 'The Art of the Listening Touch,' what is the recommended maximum pressure for palpating the Craniosacral Rhythm without triggering a defensive tissue response?",
            "options": ["5 grams", "15 grams", "25 grams", "50 grams"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The '5-gram rule' is the gold standard in CST, roughly equivalent to the weight of a nickel. This light touch allows the practitioner to bypass the body's defensive muscular guarding and perceive the subtle hydraulic forces of the CRI."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Which anatomical structure is primarily responsible for the production of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) within the ventricles?",
            "options": ["The Arachnoid Mater", "The Choroid Plexus", "The Dural Tube", "The Sagittal Sinus"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The choroid plexus, located primarily in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles, produces CSF at a rate of approximately 500ml per day, driving the pressure changes that create the Craniosacral Rhythm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "What is the generally accepted normal frequency range for the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI) in a healthy, resting adult?",
            "options": ["2-4 cycles per minute", "6-12 cycles per minute", "15-20 cycles per minute", "60-80 cycles per minute"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A normal CRI typically fluctuates between 6 and 12 cycles per minute. Rates below 6 may indicate low vitality or exhaustion, while rates above 12 may indicate acute stress or systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "During the Flexion phase of the CRI, what is the characteristic movement of the paired bones (such as the parietals and temporals)?",
            "options": ["Internal rotation and narrowing", "External rotation and widening", "Superior gliding", "Medial compression"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During flexion, the midline bones (sphenoid/occiput) rise, which causes the paired bones to rotate externally, resulting in a perceptible widening and shortening of the body's vertical axis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "While palpating a client's lower extremities, you notice the feet move into internal rotation and the body seems to lengthen slightly. Which phase of the CRI are you observing?",
            "options": ["Flexion", "Extension", "Stillpoint", "Inhalation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extension is characterized by internal rotation of the paired bones and limbs, a narrowing of the transverse diameter, and a slight lengthening of the body."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When assessing the 'Amplitude' of the CRI, what specific quality is the practitioner evaluating?",
            "options": ["The number of cycles per minute", "The distance the tissues move from the midline", "The smoothness of the transition between phases", "The comparison of movement between left and right sides"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Amplitude refers to the 'vigor' or range of the movement—how far the tissues move during the cycle. This is distinct from rate (cycles per minute) or symmetry (left vs. right)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A practitioner palpates the feet, then the knees, then the pelvic diaphragm. This sequence is part of which assessment protocol?",
            "options": ["The 10-Step Protocol", "Primary Palpation Stations", "Dural Tube Traction", "The Vault Hold"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Primary Palpation Stations involve checking the CRI at various 'listening posts' from the feet up to the head to identify where the rhythm is restricted or asymmetrical."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "How can a practitioner best differentiate the CRI from the client's arterial pulse during palpation?",
            "options": ["The CRI is significantly faster than the pulse", "The CRI is perfectly synchronized with the heartbeat", "The CRI is much slower (6-12 bpm) and lacks a sharp 'thump'", "The CRI can only be felt at the wrist"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The arterial pulse (60-100 bpm) is much faster and has a distinct mechanical 'thump.' The CRI is a slower, subtle, wave-like expansion and contraction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "In a clinical case study, a client presenting with chronic fatigue exhibits a CRI rate of 4 cycles per minute with very low amplitude. This finding most likely suggests:",
            "options": ["Hyper-sympathetic dominance", "A state of high vitality", "Low systemic vitality or 'depleted' state", "Acute inflammatory response"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A slow rate (below 6 bpm) combined with low amplitude is a classic palpatory finding for systemic depletion, chronic fatigue, or long-term illness."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "The 'Core Link' refers to the anatomical and energetic connection between which two structures via the dural tube?",
            "options": ["Sphenoid and Ethmoid", "Occiput and Sacrum", "Atlas and Axis", "Frontal and Parietal"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Core Link is the relationship between the Occiput (at the top) and the Sacrum (at the bottom), connected by the dural tube. Movement in one is typically mirrored in the other during the CRI."
