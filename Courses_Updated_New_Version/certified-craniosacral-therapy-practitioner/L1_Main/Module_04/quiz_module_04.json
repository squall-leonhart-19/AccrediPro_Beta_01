            "question": "What is the primary physiological marker that defines the 'Stillpoint' state in Craniosacral Therapy?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in the rate of the Craniosacral Rhythm (CRI)",
                "The temporary cessation of the Craniosacral Rhythm (CRI) and fluid fluctuation",
                "An increase in the production of cerebrospinal fluid within the lateral ventricles",
                "The onset of rapid, shallow thoracic breathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint is defined by the temporary suspension of the Craniosacral Rhythm (CRI), which allows the system to reorganize and the Autonomic Nervous System to reset."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "During the 'Recognition' phase of a Stillpoint, which clinical sign often precedes the deep state of stillness?",
            "options": [
                "A 'therapeutic pulse' or a localized sensation of heat",
                "Muscular guarding in the cervical spine",
                "An increase in the client's sympathetic 'fight or flight' response",
                "A decrease in skin conductivity and perspiration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Practitioners often feel a 'therapeutic pulse'—a rapid, vibrating sensation—or a release of heat just before the system settles into a true Stillpoint."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "When performing the CV4 (Compression of the Fourth Ventricle) technique, where should the practitioner's thenar eminences be placed?",
            "options": [
                "On the parietal eminences",
                "Directly on the C1 (Atlas) vertebrae",
                "On the squamous portion of the occiput, medial to the occipital mastoid sutures",
                "On the zygomatic arches"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The thenar eminences are placed on the squamous portion of the occiput. It is critical to stay medial to the sutures to avoid jamming the temporal bones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "The EV4 (Expansion of the Fourth Ventricle) technique differs from the CV4 primarily because it:",
            "options": [
                "Uses high-velocity thrusts to move the occiput",
                "Encourages the lateral expansion of the fourth ventricle to enhance fluid fluctuation",
                "Is only used for clients with high blood pressure",
                "Requires the practitioner to move the client's head into extension"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While CV4 uses compression to encourage a stillpoint, EV4 focuses on the lateral expansion of the fourth ventricle to facilitate fluid flow and structural release."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered an absolute contraindication for inducing a Stillpoint via the CV4 technique?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic migraines",
                "Acute intracranial hemorrhage or suspected aneurysm",
                "Generalized anxiety disorder",
                "Post-operative recovery from a knee replacement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Any condition where a change in intracranial pressure could be dangerous, such as an acute hemorrhage, aneurysm, or recent skull fracture, is a strict contraindication."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "What is a 'Regional Stillpoint' as described in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "A stillpoint that only occurs in specific geographic locations",
                "A cessation of motion occurring in a specific localized area of restriction rather than the whole system",
                "A stillpoint induced by applying pressure to the feet",
                "A state where only the respiratory system stops moving"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A regional stillpoint occurs when a specific area of tissue restriction reaches a point of balance and stops moving, even if the systemic CRI is still palpable elsewhere."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which branch of the nervous system is primarily supported and activated during a Stillpoint ANS Reset?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Somatic Motor System",
                "The Parasympathetic Nervous System (Ventral Vagal Complex)",
                "The Enteric Nervous System exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Stillpoint facilitates a shift from sympathetic dominance to parasympathetic activation, promoting 'rest and digest' and internal healing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the transition from Stillpoint to Equilibrium (Lesson 8), what is the practitioner's primary role as the CRI resumes?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately stop the session",
                "To force the rhythm to move faster",
                "To follow the emerging rhythm without interference, allowing it to find a new symmetry",
                "To apply heavy compression to ensure the stillpoint 'sticks'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As the CRI returns, the practitioner should 'listen' and follow the rhythm, allowing the system to reorganize into a more balanced and symmetrical state."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study mentioned in the module regarding Stillpoint application showed that a 10-minute CV4 induction resulted in:",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in cortisol levels",
                "A significant reduction in sympathetic tone and improved heart rate variability (HRV)",
                "No measurable change in the autonomic nervous system",
                "An increase in muscle tension in the lower extremities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data often shows that Stillpoint techniques improve HRV and reduce sympathetic markers, indicating a successful nervous system reset."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "If a client experiences a spontaneous Stillpoint during a session without the practitioner using a specific induction technique, the practitioner should:",
            "options": [
                "Shake the client to wake them up",
                "Continue with whatever technique they were doing regardless of the stillness",
                "Quiet their own hands and 'hold space' for the stillpoint to complete its therapeutic work",
                "Immediately move to the CV4 technique"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spontaneous stillpoints are highly therapeutic; the practitioner should respect the body's wisdom and remain still until the system chooses to resume the rhythm."
