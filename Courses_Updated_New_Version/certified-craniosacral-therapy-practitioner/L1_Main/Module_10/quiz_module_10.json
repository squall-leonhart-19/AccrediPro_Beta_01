            "question": "According to the neuroanatomy of the Primary Respiratory Mechanism (PRM), which of the following is considered one of the five core components?",
            "options": [
                "The voluntary contraction of the diaphragm",
                "The inherent motility of the brain and spinal cord",
                "The rhythmic pulsation of the radial artery",
                "The peristaltic movement of the digestive tract"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PRM consists of five components: the inherent motility of the brain and spinal cord, the fluctuation of the CSF, the motility of the intracranial and intraspinal membranes, the articular mobility of the cranial bones, and the involuntary mobility of the sacrum between the ilia."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In Palpation Mastery, the '5-gram rule' is often cited. What is the primary physiological reason for using such light pressure?",
            "options": [
                "To avoid triggering the client's sympathetic 'fight or flight' response",
                "To ensure the practitioner does not become fatigued during a 60-minute session",
                "To penetrate the deep muscle layers through sheer velocity rather than force",
                "To bypass the skin's mechanoreceptors entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Light pressure (approx. 5 grams, the weight of a nickel) allows the practitioner to interface with the craniosacral rhythm without triggering the client's defensive neuromuscular guarding or sympathetic activation."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "During the 'Unwinding Process' described in Lesson 3, what does a 'Therapeutic Pulse' typically signify?",
            "options": [
                "A dangerous increase in intracranial pressure",
                "The practitioner's own heart rate interfering with the session",
                "A rapid rhythmic reorganization of tissue indicating a release of dural restriction",
                "The end of the craniosacral rhythm's viability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A therapeutic pulse is a localized, rapid vibration or pulsation that often occurs just before or during the release of a significant myofascial or dural restriction."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Deep Listening,' what is the 'Neutral' state for a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "A state of total emotional detachment where the practitioner ignores the client's history",
                "A balanced state of presence where the practitioner is receptive without agenda or projection",
                "A physical posture where the practitioner sits with legs crossed",
                "A verbal technique used to redirect the client's complaints"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neutrality is a foundational concept in CST where the practitioner maintains a 'wide-angle' focus, allowing the client's system to lead the therapeutic process without the practitioner imposing a specific outcome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which technique is specifically designed to induce a Stillpoint by encouraging the 'latching' of the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse?",
            "options": [
                "Frontal Lift",
                "Parietal Spread",
                "CV4 (Compression of the Fourth Ventricle)",
                "Temporal Ear Pull"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CV4 technique involves following the narrowing of the occiput during the extension phase and gently resisting the subsequent flexion phase, which induces a systemic Stillpoint and enhances CSF fluctuation."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "When assessing the Sphenobasilar Synchondrosis (SBS), a 'Torsion' strain pattern is named for:",
            "options": [
                "The direction the sacrum rotates during flexion",
                "The side of the greater wing of the sphenoid that is more superior",
                "The side of the occiput that feels 'heavy' or 'stuck'",
                "The degree of vertical displacement of the ethmoid bone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In an SBS Torsion, the sphenoid and occiput rotate in opposite directions around an anterior-posterior axis. The torsion is named for the side of the sphenoid's greater wing that moves superiorly."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Within the PULSE Framework (Lesson 7), the 'P' stands for Presence. Which of the following best describes 'Clinical Presence'?",
            "options": [
                "The physical act of being in the room with the client",
                "The ability to maintain a grounded, centered state that provides a 'safe container' for the client",
                "Consistently talking to the client to ensure they stay awake",
                "Ensuring the practitioner's credentials are visible on the wall"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Presence in the PULSE framework refers to the practitioner's energetic and psychological grounding, which allows the client's autonomic nervous system to feel safe enough to enter a healing state."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes practitioner self-care. What is the concept of 'Fulcrum Maintenance' in a clinical setting?",

                "Increasing the price of sessions to reduce the number of clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A practitioner must be their own 'stable fulcrum.' Fulcrum maintenance involves self-regulation, ergonomics, and energetic boundaries to prevent burnout and vicarious trauma."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "During the Flexion phase of the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse, what movement occurs in the paired bones (e.g., Temporals, Parietals)?",
            "options": [
                "Internal Rotation",
                "External Rotation",
                "Superior Glide",
                "Medial Compression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the flexion phase of the CRI, the midline bones (sphenoid, occiput) flex, while the paired bones (temporals, parietals, etc.) undergo external rotation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic migraines and a history of whiplash. During palpation, you feel a 'hard' quality in the suboccipital tissues and a lack of CRI movement. After inducing a Stillpoint, the tissue softens and the CRI returns with greater amplitude. This outcome is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "A placebo effect",
                "Systemic reorganization and the 'rebound' effect of the Stillpoint",
                "The client falling asleep and losing muscle tone",
                "The practitioner applying too much pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inducing a Stillpoint allows the system to 'reset.' The subsequent return of the CRI with greater amplitude and more fluid tissue quality indicates a successful therapeutic shift and improved CSF dynamics."
