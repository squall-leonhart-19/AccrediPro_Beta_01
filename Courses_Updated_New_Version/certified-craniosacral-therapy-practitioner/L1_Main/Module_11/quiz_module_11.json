            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Within the P.U.L.S.E. framework introduced in Lesson 1, what does the 'P' primarily represent in the context of establishing the therapeutic entry point?",
            "options": [
                "Pressure: Applying 5 grams of force",
                "Presence: Establishing a neutral, non-judgmental state of being",
                "Palpation: The physical act of touching the client",
                "Pulsation: Identifying the heart rate vs. the CRI"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the P.U.L.S.E. framework, 'P' stands for Presence. It is the foundational step of establishing a neutral, grounded state and a 'relational field' before any physical correction is attempted."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "The Sphenobasilar Synchondrosis (SBS) is considered the 'engine' of the Primary Respiratory Mechanism. Which two bones meet at this junction?",
            "options": [
                "The Sphenoid and the Ethmoid",
                "The Occiput and the Temporal bones",
                "The Sphenoid and the Occiput",
                "The Parietal bones and the Sphenoid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SBS is the cartilaginous joint where the basilar portion of the occiput and the body of the sphenoid meet; its movement dictates the flexion and extension phases of the entire craniosacral system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "During the 'Vertical Unwinding' process (Lesson 3), the practitioner focuses on the Dural Tube. Where are the primary physical attachments of the dural tube within the spinal canal?",
            "options": [
                "C1, C2, and the entire Lumbar spine",
                "The Foramen Magnum, C2, C3, and S2",
                "The Thalamus and the Coccyx",
                "Only at the L5-S1 junction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dural tube (spinal dura mater) is relatively free-floating but has firm attachments at the Foramen Magnum, the second and third cervical vertebrae (C2, C3), and the second sacral segment (S2)."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Listening' (L) is categorized by different 'tides.' Which tide is described as having a rhythm of approximately 2.5 cycles per minute?",
            "options": [
                "The Cranial Rhythm Impulse (CRI)",
                "The Mid-Tide",
                "The Long Tide",
                "The Ultradian Rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mid-Tide is a slower, more profound rhythm than the CRI, typically oscillating at a rate of about 2.5 cycles per minute (or a 24-second cycle), representing the movement of the 'Potency' within the fluid."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When inducing a Stillpoint (S) using the CV4 technique, what is the physiological objective regarding the fourth ventricle?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the rapid production of cerebrospinal fluid",
                "To physically compress the cerebellum for motor control",
                "To encourage a temporary cessation of the CRI to allow the system to reboot",
                "To decrease the temperature of the brain stem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint is a therapeutic pause in the Craniosacral Rhythm. By gently resisting the filling (flexion) phase at the occiput (CV4), the practitioner encourages the system to 'reset,' which enhances fluid exchange and shifts the patient into parasympathetic dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, Sacral Integration focuses on 'nutation.' What occurs during sacral nutation in the flexion phase of the PRM?",
            "options": [
                "The sacral base moves anteriorly and inferiorly while the apex moves posteriorly",
                "The sacral base moves posteriorly and superiorly (counternutation)",
                "The sacrum rotates along a longitudinal axis",
                "The sacrum moves laterally toward the dominant ilium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the flexion phase of the Primary Respiratory Mechanism (PRM), the sacral base moves posteriorly (counternutation). However, in general biomechanics, nutation refers to the base moving anteriorly/inferiorly. In CST, we specifically track the sacral base moving posteriorly during cranial flexion."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Systemic Homeostasis' (E - Equilibrium). Which phenomenon is often reported by clients when the Long Tide (0.6 cycles per minute) becomes the dominant field?",
            "options": [
                "Increased muscle twitching and rapid eye movement",
                "A sense of 'oneness,' deep stillness, and profound systemic relaxation",
                "A sudden spike in heart rate and respiratory frequency",
                "Intense localized heat at the site of a former injury"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Long Tide is associated with the 'Breath of Life' at its most fundamental level. When the system reaches this state of Equilibrium (E), clients often experience a deep sense of stillness and holistic integration."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When applying the P.U.L.S.E. framework in practice (Lesson 8), why is 'Unwinding' (U) placed before 'Stillpoint' (S) in the sequence?",
            "options": [
                "Because unwinding requires more physical strength",
                "To clear peripheral fascial restrictions so the central nervous system can reach a deeper stillpoint",
                "Because the Stillpoint must always happen at the very end of a session",
                "There is no specific reason; the letters are just an acronym"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unwinding (U) helps release the 'noise' of gross tissue restrictions. Clearing these peripheral tensions allows the practitioner to more easily access the deeper rhythms required to induce a meaningful Stillpoint (S)."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Torsion' strain pattern at the SBS. How is this specifically palpated?",
            "options": [
                "The sphenoid and occiput rotate in opposite directions around an anterior-posterior axis",
                "The sphenoid and occiput both move superiorly",
                "The entire cranium feels compressed from front to back",
                "The bones feel wider on one side and narrower on the other"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An SBS Torsion is a physiological strain where the sphenoid and occiput rotate in opposite directions around an anterior-posterior axis. It is named for the 'high' greater wing of the sphenoid (left or right)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "According to the clinical integration guidelines in Lesson 8, what is the 'Rule of 5 Grams' primarily intended to prevent?",
            "options": [
                "Practitioner hand fatigue",
                "The client's body from engaging its defensive neuromuscular guarding response",
                "Overheating the cerebrospinal fluid",
                "Breaking the delicate sutures of the cranium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 5 Grams' (the weight of a nickel) is used because excessive pressure triggers the body's voluntary and involuntary muscle guarding. Light touch allows the practitioner to bypass the 'outer' resistance and communicate directly with the fascial and fluid systems."
