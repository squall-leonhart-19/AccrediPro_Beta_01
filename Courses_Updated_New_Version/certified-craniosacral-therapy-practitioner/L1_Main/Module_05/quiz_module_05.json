            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, what is the primary objective of the 'Equilibrium' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the initial restriction in the dural tube",
                "To induce a therapeutic stillpoint and integrate the changes made during the session",
                "To apply high-velocity low-amplitude thrusts to the sphenoid",
                "To increase the heart rate of the client through rhythmic rocking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Equilibrium is the final phase of the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, focusing on integration, autonomic balancing, and ensuring the client is grounded before leaving the table."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "When balancing the Autonomic Fulcrum, which physiological sign indicates a shift from sympathetic dominance to parasympathetic 'Equilibrium'?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, shallow breathing and increased muscle guarding",
                "Dilation of the pupils and cold extremities",
                "A deep 'therapeutic sigh,' softening of the tissues, and a slower, fuller CRI",
                "Increased bowel sounds and immediate perspiration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'therapeutic sigh' and the transition to a slower, more rhythmic Cranial Rhythm Impulse (CRI) are hallmark signs of the nervous system shifting into a restorative parasympathetic state."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the 'New Functional Normal' for the Sphenobasilar Synchondrosis (SBS) during the Equilibrium phase?",
            "options": [
                "A state of permanent flexion to maximize CSF flow",
                "A state of dynamic neutrality where the SBS moves freely through its full range without restriction",
                "A rigid lock that prevents any further torsion",
                "A state where the Sphenoid is significantly higher than the Occiput"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Equilibrium at the SBS is not about lack of movement, but about dynamic neutrality—the ability of the joint to cycle through flexion and extension with symmetry and ease."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "The 'Core Link' synchronization focuses on the relationship between which two structures to ensure dural tension is balanced?",
            "options": [
                "The Frontal bone and the Ethmoid",
                "The Atlas (C1) and the Axis (C2)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Core Link refers to the dural connection between the occiput and the sacrum; synchronization here ensures that the entire spinal column and dural tube are in equilibrium."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses Fluid Homeostasis. What role does the 'Glymphatic System' play in maintaining equilibrium within the CNS?",
            "options": [
                "It produces the majority of the body's hormones",
                "It acts as a waste-clearance system that is most active during sleep and stillpoints",
                "It prevents CSF from entering the spinal canal",
                "It regulates the temperature of the cranial vault"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is the CNS's waste-clearance mechanism, which research shows is highly active during the deep relaxation states (like stillpoints) achieved in CST."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "A client feels 'disoriented' or 'spaced out' immediately following a deep SBS release. Which grounding technique from Lesson 6 is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Performing another CV4 stillpoint to deepen the state",
                "Using gentle compression through the long axis of the legs or feet to encourage proprioceptive awareness",
                "Asking the client to stand up quickly to 'shake it off'",
                "Applying heavy pressure to the frontal bone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive grounding, such as gentle compression of the feet or ankles, helps the client 're-inhabit' their physical body after the deep internal shifts of a CST session."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "During the Comparative Assessment (Lesson 7), the practitioner compares the post-session CRI to the pre-session CRI. What specific change indicates a successful outcome?",
            "options": [
                "The CRI should be twice as fast as the initial measurement",
                "The CRI should be absent, indicating total stillness",
                "The CRI should demonstrate improved symmetry, amplitude, and a smoother quality of motion",
                "The CRI should only be felt at the cranium and not the sacrum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A successful session is verified by the quality of the rhythm—increased symmetry between left/right sides and a more 'vital' or smooth amplitude in the pulse."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "In the context of Longitudinal Care (Lesson 8), why is it recommended that clients avoid high-intensity exercise for 24-48 hours after a session?",
            "options": [
                "Because CST makes the bones of the skull brittle",
                "To allow the nervous system to integrate the 'New Functional Normal' without immediate sympathetic override",
                "Because the client will be too tired to perform exercise",
                "To prevent the CSF from leaking out of the dural tube"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The body continues to process and integrate the changes for 24-48 hours; high-intensity stress can trigger a sympathetic rebound that overrides the newly established equilibrium."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a client who has chronic endocrine imbalances. According to Lesson 5, which structure's 'equilibrium' is most critical for pituitary health?",
            "options": [
                "The Sella Turcica of the Sphenoid",
                "The Zygomatic arch",
                "The Mastoid process",
                "The Mental protuberance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The pituitary gland sits within the Sella Turcica of the sphenoid bone. Balancing the sphenoid (SBS integration) is vital for optimal fluid environment and mechanical freedom of the master gland."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Session Closure' dialogue described in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the client with a specific medical condition",
                "To provide a complex neurological explanation of the session",
                "To help the client cognitively bridge their internal experience with their external reality",
                "To convince the client to book ten more sessions immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Closure dialogue helps the client process the 'felt-sense' of the session, making the internal changes more sustainable and 'real' as they return to their daily lives."
