            "options": [
                "Active manipulation of the dural tube",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Listen' phase of the PULSE Framework™ is characterized by the practitioner entering a state of 'Therapeutic Neutral,' where they observe the system's inherent rhythms without trying to change or fix them."

            "options": [
                "2-4 cycles per minute",
                "14-20 cycles per minute",

                "60-80 cycles per minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CRI is a subtle rhythmic cycle that typically occurs at a rate of 6 to 12 cycles per minute in a healthy individual, distinct from heart rate or respiration."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "During the 'Unwind' (U) phase, a practitioner feels a sudden 'softening' or 'melting' sensation in the myofascial tissues. This is clinically referred to as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Release Phenomenon' occurs during the Unwind phase when the dural or myofascial tissues reach a state of ease and begin to dissipate stored tension or 'tissue memory'."

            "options": [
                "The Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sphenobasilar Synchondrosis (SBS), the junction between the sphenoid and the occiput, is the primary articulation for cranial motion and is considered the system's keystone."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "During SBS flexion, how do the sphenoid and occiput move in relation to the practitioner's hands?",
            "options": [
                "The base of the SBS rises (moves superiorly) and the head widens",
                "The base of the SBS sinks (moves inferiorly) and the head narrows",
                "The sphenoid rotates clockwise while the occiput rotates counter-clockwise",
                "Both bones move toward the feet (caudally)"

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the flexion phase of the CRI, the base of the SBS rises (flexion), causing the head to widen slightly and the paired bones to rotate externally."

            "id": "q14_6",

            "options": [
                "To increase the heart rate for better circulation",
                "To force the cerebrospinal fluid into the ventricles",
                "To allow the autonomic nervous system to shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance",
                "To stretch the spinal cord"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint induces a temporary pause in the CRI, which facilitates a 'system reboot' of the central nervous system and encourages a shift toward parasympathetic (rest and digest) dominance."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Equilibrium' (E) is described as the final stage of a session. How does a practitioner recognize that systemic homeostasis has been achieved?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to sweat profusely",
                "The CRI becomes erratic and fast",
                "There is a 'Global Synchronization' where the rhythm is uniform across all palpation points",
                "The client's muscles become rigid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Equilibrium is identified by 'Global Synchronization,' where the cranial rhythm feels symmetrical, balanced, and uniform throughout the entire body."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic migraines and a 'compressed' feeling at the base of the skull. Which L1 technique is most appropriate for addressing the dural tension involved?",
            "options": [
                "CV4 Stillpoint Induction",
                "Occipital Condyle Release",
                "V-Spread on the Frontal Bone",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Occipital Condyle Release specifically targets the junction where the atlas meets the occiput, releasing the dural tube at its superior attachment point to alleviate compression-related headaches."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "When sequencing a full L1 Deep Dive session (Lesson 8), why is the Pelvic Diaphragm release usually performed before the Thoracic Inlet?",
            "options": [
                "To follow the flow of gravity",
                "To ensure the 'lower' transverse diaphragms are open to receive fluid flow from 'above'",
                "Because the pelvic diaphragm is larger",
                "There is no specific reason; the order is arbitrary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the L1 protocol, releasing the diaphragms from inferior to superior (or ensuring the lower 'drains' are open) allows for more effective systemic fluid movement and pressure equalization."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A practitioner observes a 'Sign of Release' during the Unwind phase, such as a deep sigh or rapid eye movement (REM). What is the recommended practitioner response?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the session to talk to the client",
                "Increase hand pressure to deepen the release",
                "Maintain 'Therapeutic Presence' and allow the process to complete without interference",
                "Ask the client to hold their breath"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a 'Sign of Release' occurs, the practitioner should maintain their presence and 'Neutral' state, allowing the client's self-correcting mechanism to process the release fully."
