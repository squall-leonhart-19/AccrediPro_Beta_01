            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unwinding relies on following the tissue into its direction of ease (indirect technique) to allow the body to release stored tension patterns."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Art of Listening' (Lesson 6), what does 'Practitioner Neutral' signify?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neutrality is the ability to 'listen' to the tissue without trying to fix it, which creates the safety necessary for the client's system to self-correct."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A practitioner palpating the sacrum notices it moving into 'Extension.' In the context of the cranial cycle, this means the sacral base is moving:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During cranial extension, the sacral base moves anteriorly (nutation). During cranial flexion, the sacral base moves posteriorly (counsel-nutation)."
