            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "When refining palpation of the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI), what is the standard 'normal' frequency range for a healthy adult at rest?",
            "options": [
                "2 to 4 cycles per minute",
                "6 to 12 cycles per minute",
                "15 to 20 cycles per minute",
                "25 to 30 cycles per minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CRI typically fluctuates between 6 and 12 cycles per minute in a healthy, resting adult; rates outside this range may indicate systemic stress or pathology."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "During advanced myofascial unwinding (Lesson 2), what is the practitioner's primary role once the 'unwinding' motion has begun?",
            "options": [
                "To apply 5 grams of counter-pressure to stop the movement",
                "To direct the limb back toward a neutral anatomical position",
                "To follow the tissue's path of least resistance without leading",
                "To increase the speed of the motion to facilitate heat release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unwinding requires the practitioner to follow the client's tissue through its path of ease (least resistance), allowing the body's self-corrective mechanisms to resolve the restriction."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "In the 'Art of Listening' (Lesson 3), which term describes the practitioner's ability to remain present and grounded while resisting the urge to 'fix' the client?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic Presence is the state of being fully present, non-judgmental, and grounded, which creates the safe space necessary for deep somatic healing."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Which physiological indicator most accurately signals that a client has entered a 'Stillpoint' during a CV4 technique?",

                "Muscle guarding in the cervical spine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint is characterized by the rhythmic motion of the CRI coming to a halt, often followed by signs of parasympathetic activation like a deep breath or a 'softening' of the tissues."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Within the P.U.L.S.E. integration framework (Lesson 5), what does the 'E' represent in the clinical sequence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "P.U.L.S.E. stands for Presence, Unwinding, Listening, Stillpoint, and Equilibrium Restoration, which focuses on integrating the changes into the client's whole system."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A torsion of the Sphenobasilar Junction (SBJ) is named based on which specific palpatory finding?",
            "options": [
                "The direction the base of the Occiput moves",
                "The greater wing of the Sphenoid that appears higher (superior)",
                "The side toward which the Vomer deviates",
                "The downward rotation of the Ethmoid bone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In SBJ biomechanics, a torsion is named for the side of the greater wing of the sphenoid that moves superiorly (upward) during the cranial flexion phase."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "When assessing Dural Tube Dynamics (Lesson 7), what does a 'restricted glide' during a sacral pull typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive cerebrospinal fluid production",
                "An anteriorly displaced atlas (C1)",

                "A fracture of the coccyx"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The dural tube should glide freely within the spinal canal; a lack of mobility suggests dural tension or 'tethering' that can affect the entire craniosacral system."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "According to the L1 Professional Session structure (Lesson 8), what is the first step in the '10-Step Protocol' after the initial assessment?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Standard L1 protocol usually begins with a Stillpoint induction at the feet (or sacrum) to ground the client and encourage a global system reset."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vertical strains are named for the direction of the base of the sphenoid; if it moves upward (superiorly) relative to the occiput, it is a Superior Vertical Strain."
