            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™ introduced in Lesson 1, what does the 'U' represent in the context of practitioner preparation?",
            "options": [
                "Universal Alignment",
                "Unconditional Presence",

                "Underlying Rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The P.U.L.S.E. Framework™ stands for Presence, Unbiased Observation, Listening Touch, Stillpoint Induction, and Equilibrium. Unbiased Observation is critical for avoiding 'fixing' and instead 'witnessing' the client's system."

            "question": "According to the Primary Respiratory Mechanism (PRM) model, which of the following is considered one of the five core components?",
            "options": [
                "The rhythmic contraction of the heart",
                "The inherent motility of the brain and spinal cord",

                "The peristaltic movement of the digestive tract"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Sutherland identified the inherent motility of the brain and spinal cord as a primary component of the PRM, distinct from secondary respiration (breathing)."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "During Palpation Mastery (Lesson 3), what is the recommended 'starting weight' for a therapeutic touch to avoid triggering a client's defensive muscle guarding?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5 grams (the weight of a nickel)",
                "Approximately 50 grams",
                "At least 1 pound of pressure",
                "Variable pressure based on the client's BMI"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The '5-gram rule' is a hallmark of Craniosacral Therapy, allowing the practitioner to interface with the fascial and fluid levels without triggering the body's protective stretch reflex."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "The 'Core Link' discussed in Lesson 4 refers to the anatomical and functional continuity between which two structures?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Core Link' is the connection between the Occiput and the Sacrum, joined by the dural tube, which allows for the transmission of the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI)."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "During the 'Flexion' phase of Cranial Vault Dynamics, what is the expected movement of the paired Parietal bones?",

                "External rotation and lateral expansion",
                "Anterior tilt and compression",
                "The parietal bones do not move during flexion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the flexion phase of the CRI, the midline bones rise and the paired bones (like the parietals) move into external rotation and lateral expansion."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological objective of inducing a 'Stillpoint' (Lesson 6)?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the heart rate for better circulation",
                "To force the CSF to flow faster through the ventricles",
                "To allow the autonomic nervous system to shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance",
                "To diagnose specific bone fractures in the cranial vault"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint induction encourages a 'reset' of the system, facilitating a shift into the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes healing and tissue reorganization."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Systemic Integration' is achieved when the practitioner observes which of the following signs?",
            "options": [
                "A significant increase in the client's body temperature",
                "A 'therapeutic pulse' or a sense of global fluid coherence",
                "The client becoming agitated or restless",
                "A total cessation of the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse for over 30 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic integration is often signaled by a therapeutic pulse, rhythmic heat, or a sense that the various parts of the system are moving in a coherent, unified rhythm."

            "options": [
                "Performing a CV4 Stillpoint induction",
                "Suggesting that CST can replace necessary surgical intervention for a pathology",
                "Maintaining a neutral clinical presence",
                "Palpating the CRI at the feet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must never suggest CST as a replacement for medical or surgical necessity. This violates the scope of practice and ethical guidelines regarding medical advice."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study cited in the module regarding palpation reliability found that experienced practitioners could detect the CRI with high inter-rater reliability when:",
            "options": [
                "They used heavy pressure",
                "They were in a state of high clinical presence and neutrality",
                "The client was speaking during the session",
                "They focused only on the heart rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical presence and neutrality are proven to enhance the practitioner's sensitivity and the reliability of palpation findings."

            "question": "When working with the Temporal bones, why is the 'Ear Pull' technique used in L1 protocols?",
            "options": [
                "To drain the middle ear of excess fluid",
                "To decompress the tentorium cerebelli and address the petrosal portion of the bone",
                "To improve the client's hearing acuity immediately",
                "To stretch the skin around the zygomatic arch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The temporal ear pull is a gentle way to interface with the deep intracranial membranes (tentorium cerebelli) and encourage decompression of the temporal bones."
