            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, what is the primary objective of the 'L' (Listen) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To apply corrective force to the cranial bones",
                "To establish a state of therapeutic neutrality and monitor tissue response",
                "To induce a Stillpoint through the CV4 technique",
                "To measure the exact volume of cerebrospinal fluid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Listen' phase focuses on therapeutic presence and neutrality, allowing the practitioner to dialogue with the tissue without imposing an external agenda."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "The 'Core Link' in craniosacral anatomy refers to the mechanical and hydraulic connection between which two structures?",
            "options": [
                "The Frontal bone and the Sphenoid",
                "The C1 vertebra and the C7 vertebra",
                "The Occiput and the Sacrum",
                "The Temporal bone and the Mandible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Core Link is the relationship between the occiput and the sacrum, joined by the dural tube, which allows for the transmission of the craniosacral rhythm."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "What is the physiological significance of utilizing a '5-gram touch' during palpation?",
            "options": [
                "It is the minimum pressure required to move the parietal bones",
                "It avoids triggering the body's defensive muscle guarding and mechanoreceptor response",
                "It is the exact weight of the cerebrospinal fluid in the third ventricle",
                "It ensures the practitioner's hands stay warm during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Light touch (roughly the weight of a nickel) allows the practitioner to bypass the body's 'intruder' response, facilitating deeper access to the fascial and dural layers."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "A healthy adult Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI) typically manifests at what rate?",
            "options": [
                "2-4 cycles per minute",
                "6-12 cycles per minute",
                "15-20 cycles per minute",
                "60-80 cycles per minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard CRI rate in a healthy individual is generally accepted as 6 to 12 cycles per minute, consisting of an inhalation (flexion) and exhalation (extension) phase."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "During the 'Unwind' (U) phase of the framework, what should the practitioner do when they encounter a 'barrier' in the tissue?",
            "options": [
                "Apply 20-30 grams of pressure to break through the restriction",
                "Immediately move to a different part of the body",
                "Follow the tissue into the direction of ease (least resistance) to facilitate release",
                "Ask the client to take deep, forceful breaths to assist the movement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unwinding involves following the tissue's inherent path of least resistance rather than forcing a correction, allowing the body's self-corrective mechanisms to take over."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark sign that a client has entered a 'Stillpoint'?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in heart rate and rapid eye movement",
                "A sudden twitching of the lower extremities",
                "A temporary cessation of the CRI followed by a deep sigh or autonomic shift",
                "The cranial bones becoming noticeably hot to the touch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint is characterized by a pause in the rhythmic motion, often accompanied by signs of parasympathetic activation like deep breathing, softening of tissues, or borborygmus."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "The 'CV4' technique (Compression of the 4th Ventricle) is primarily used within the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™ to:",
            "options": [
                "Induce a Stillpoint and encourage systemic fluid exchange",

                "Diagnose a fracture in the occipital bone",
                "Increase the rate of the CRI to over 20 cycles per minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The CV4 technique encourages a Stillpoint by gently resisting the expansion phase of the CRI at the occiput, which helps reset the autonomic nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "In the 'Equilibrium' (E) phase, the practitioner's focus shifts toward:",

                "Initiating a new unwinding process",
                "Ending the session abruptly to prevent over-treatment",
                "Integrating the changes and ensuring the system has returned to a state of balance",
                "Documenting the client's insurance information"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Equilibrium is the final stage where the practitioner checks for symmetry and integration, ensuring the client's system has stabilized after the therapeutic interventions."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "If a practitioner palpates a CRI that is high in amplitude but very low in frequency (e.g., 3 cycles per minute), this may clinically indicate:",
            "options": [
                "A state of high athletic performance",
                "Systemic exhaustion, chronic fatigue, or severe depression",
                "Acute inflammation of the meninges",
                "Normal physiological functioning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A very low CRI frequency often correlates with low vitality, chronic conditions, or states of significant emotional or physical depletion."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Listen' (L) module, what is 'Tissue Dialogue'?",
            "options": [
                "Verbally explaining the anatomy to the client during the session",
                "The non-verbal communication between the practitioner’s hands and the client’s fascial response",
                "Asking the client to describe their pain on a scale of 1 to 10",
                "The sound the joints make when they release during a Stillpoint"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tissue dialogue refers to the subtle, tactile feedback loop where the practitioner senses the tissue's 'requests' and 'responses' to the therapeutic touch."
