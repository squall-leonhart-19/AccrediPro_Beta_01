            "question": "In the context of Myofascial Unwinding, which biological process describes how the practitioner's mechanical touch is converted into cellular chemical signals for tissue remodeling?",
            "options": [
                "Mechanotransduction",
                "Phagocytosis",
                "Osmotic Diffusion",
                "Neural Plasticity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mechanotransduction is the process by which cells convert mechanical stimuli (like the light touch used in CST) into electrochemical activity, allowing for myofascial remodeling."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "The 'Core Link' is a fundamental concept in Module 2. It refers to the continuous dural connection between which two anatomical structures?",
            "options": [
                "The C1 vertebra and the L5 vertebra",
                "The Sphenoid and the Ethmoid bones",
                "The Occiput and the second sacral segment (S2)",
                "The Hyoid bone and the Thoracic Inlet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Core Link refers to the reciprocal tension membrane (dura mater) that connects the internal cranium (occiput) to the sacrum, specifically at the level of S2."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When a practitioner reaches the 'Physiological Barrier' during a release, what is the most effective way to facilitate the 'Melting Point'?",
            "options": [
                "Apply 5-10 lbs of pressure to force the tissue to yield",
                "Back off completely and move to a different body part",
                "Maintain a constant, light 'listening' touch and wait for the tissue to soften",
                "Perform rapid oscillations to vibrate the fascia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Melting Point occurs when the practitioner maintains a steady, light presence at the barrier, allowing the tissue's innate intelligence to transition from a 'gel' to a 'sol' state."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "During the Transverse Diaphragm Release for the Respiratory Diaphragm, where should the practitioner's hands be placed?",
            "options": [
                "One hand on the forehead, one on the chest",
                "Both hands on the anterior rib cage",
                "One hand posteriorly at the T12-L1 junction, the other anteriorly over the solar plexus/lower ribs",
                "One hand on the sacrum, one on the occiput"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To release the respiratory diaphragm, the practitioner 'sandwiches' the area with one hand under the thoracolumbar junction and the other over the lower rib cage and xiphoid process."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Thoracic Outlet Syndrome' symptoms, including numbness in the fingers. Which 'Unwind' technique from Lesson 5 is most indicated?",

                "Lumbosacral Unwinding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Thoracic Inlet Release addresses the fascial and muscular tensions at the top of the rib cage where the brachial plexus passes, making it the primary intervention for thoracic outlet symptoms."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "What is the primary clinical goal of performing Dural Tube Traction as described in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the heart rate of the client",
                "To facilitate longitudinal stretching and decompression of the spinal meninges",
                "To adjust the alignment of the cervical vertebrae manually",
                "To drain the lymphatic system of the lower extremities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dural Tube Traction is designed to create a gentle longitudinal stretch along the spinal canal, helping to release dural adhesions and decompress the entire spinal column."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "In Extremity Unwinding (Lesson 7), if a client's leg begins to move in a slow, circular pattern, what should the practitioner do?",
            "options": [
                "Stop the movement to prevent injury",
                "Direct the movement into a stretch they feel the client needs",
                "Support the weight of the limb and follow the movement wherever it leads",
                "Ask the client to stop moving and relax their muscles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extremity unwinding is a 'follow the lead' technique. The practitioner supports the limb to negate gravity and follows the spontaneous tissue-led movements without interference."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "According to the Tensegrity model discussed in Lesson 1, how does the body-wide fascial network respond to localized tension?",
            "options": [
                "Tension remains isolated to the specific muscle involved",
                "The entire system redistributes the stress, potentially causing symptoms far from the actual restriction",
                "The fascia becomes more liquid and soft immediately",
                "The bones take on all the mechanical load to protect the fascia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tensegrity (Tension Integrity) implies that the body is a continuous tension network; a restriction in one area (e.g., the pelvis) can create compensatory tension elsewhere (e.g., the neck)."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which 'Sign of Release' is most commonly observed when a transverse diaphragm successfully 'melts'?",
            "options": [
                "Increased muscle guarding",
                "A sudden drop in skin temperature",
                "A therapeutic sigh or a change in respiratory rhythm",
                "Rapid eye movement (REM)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A therapeutic sigh, deep spontaneous breath, or a sudden softening of the tissues are classic physiological indicators that a fascial restriction has released."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When integrating the 'Unwind' into clinical practice, why is it often recommended to address the transverse diaphragms before moving to specific cranial bone work?",
            "options": [
                "Because the diaphragms are easier to find",
                "To 'clear the path' by reducing horizontal restrictions that may interfere with the vertical flow of the CSR",
                "Because cranial bones cannot move if the legs are tense",
                "To ensure the client falls asleep before the session ends"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the transverse diaphragms (horizontal planes of fascia) clears major 'kinks' in the system, allowing for a more accurate assessment and better response to cranial work."
