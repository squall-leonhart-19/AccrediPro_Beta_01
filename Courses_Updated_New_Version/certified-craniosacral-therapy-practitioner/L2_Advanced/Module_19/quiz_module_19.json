            "question": "Which landmark research period at Michigan State University provided the histological evidence that cranial sutures remain patent and contain vascular/nerve tissue into adulthood?",
            "options": [
                "1930–1940 (Sutherland)",
                "1975–1983 (Upledger & Retzlaff)",
                "1995–2000 (Milne)",
                "2010–2015 (Haller et al.)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The research conducted by Dr. John Upledger and Ernest Retzlaff at MSU (1975–1983) used electron microscopy to prove that cranial sutures do not fully fuse in most adults and contain active biological structures."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the validation of the Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI), what did the research by Nelson et al. (2001) demonstrate regarding its frequency?",
            "options": [
                "The CRI is identical to the heart rate frequency.",
                "The CRI is a subset of the respiratory cycle.",
                "The CRI is a distinct rhythm, independent of heart rate and respiration.",
                "The CRI cannot be measured by objective instrumentation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nelson's research used simultaneous recording of the CRI, EKG, and respiration, proving that the CRI is a distinct physiological rhythm that occurs at a different frequency than heart or breath rates."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "The 2016 meta-analysis by Haller et al. on Craniosacral Therapy for chronic pain concluded which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "CST was no more effective than a placebo.",
                "CST showed significant large effect sizes for pain intensity and quality of life.",
                "CST is only effective for acute pain, not chronic pain.",
                "There is insufficient evidence to recommend CST for any condition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Haller’s meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found significant clinical evidence and large effect sizes for CST in treating chronic neck and back pain, migraine, and fibromyalgia."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "According to the research on the Glymphatic System (Maiken Nedergaard, 2012), how does CST theoretically assist in metabolic waste clearance?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the temperature of the brain tissue.",
                "By manually squeezing the lymph nodes in the neck.",
                "By facilitating the exchange between Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Interstitial Fluid (ISF).",
                "By preventing the production of CSF during sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Glymphatic system relies on CSF moving through the periarterial spaces to flush metabolic waste (like Amyloid-beta) from the brain's interstitial space, a process CST aims to support through fluid dynamic techniques."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which physiological marker is most frequently used in CST research to objectively measure the shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance?",

                "Muscle Mass Index"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the gold standard for measuring Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) regulation; an increase in HRV indicates improved parasympathetic tone following CST."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "In the 2019 study by Castejón-Castejón regarding pediatric CST and infantile colic, what was the primary recorded outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increased birth weight",
                "Reduction in crying hours and improved sleep duration",

            "options": [
                "Practitioners cannot agree on the location of the sacrum.",
                "Different practitioners often palpate different CRI rates on the same subject.",
                "Patients do not enjoy the treatment.",
                "Insurance companies refuse to code for palpation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inter-rater reliability (the ability of two different practitioners to find the same result) has historically been low in CST, highlighting the need for standardized frameworks like P.U.L.S.E.™."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "In the AccrediPro P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, what does the 'U' represent?",

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Why is 'Sham' or 'Light Touch' control used in high-quality CST clinical trials?",
            "options": [
                "To prove that touch is unnecessary for healing.",
                "To distinguish the specific effects of CST techniques from the non-specific effects of general human contact.",
                "To save money on practitioner training.",
                "To ensure the patient does not fall asleep during the study."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sham controls (non-specific light touch) are used to determine if the specific therapeutic maneuvers of CST produce outcomes superior to just holding the patient, which helps validate CST as a distinct modality."
