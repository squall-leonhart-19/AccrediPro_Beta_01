        {
            "id": "q21_1",
            "question": "In the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™ for clinical reasoning, what does the 'U' represent when assessing a restriction?",
            "options": ["Underlying Pathology", "Urgency/Undercurrent", "Unilateral Tension", "Upper Quadrant"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urgency/Undercurrent refers to the vitality or 'drive' behind the restriction, helping the practitioner determine if the tissue is ready to release or if it is a primary compensatory pattern."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "According to the architecture of a high-level CST session, which phase is dedicated to the 'Therapeutic Climax'?",
            "options": ["The Opening Sequence", "The Evaluation Phase", "The Deep Work Phase", "The Integration Phase"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Deep Work Phase is where the primary restrictions identified in the evaluation are addressed, often leading to the session's most significant releases or 'therapeutic climax'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When sequencing a session, why is it strategically advantageous to address the transverse diaphragms before the cranial vault?",
            "options": ["To increase the client's blood pressure", "To ensure the client is fully conscious", "To remove peripheral 'drag' on the dural tube and facilitate better fluid flow", "To bypass the need for a Stillpoint"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Releasing the transverse diaphragms (pelvic, respiratory, thoracic inlet, hyoid) removes mechanical obstructions that can create 'drag' on the dural tube, allowing cranial work to be more effective."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "For a client in the 'Acute Phase' of an injury (e.g., 0-72 hours post-trauma), what is the primary goal of the treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Deep tissue stripping and myofascial release", "Aggressive SomatoEmotional Release (SER) facilitation", "Calming the sympathetic nervous system and reducing fluid stasis", "Provoking a healing crisis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In acute stages, the focus is on down-regulating the 'fight or flight' response and encouraging the gentle movement of fluids to reduce inflammation and pain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Which clinical 'sign-post' indicates that a practitioner should consider integrating SomatoEmotional Release (SER) into the current session?",
            "options": ["The client falls into a deep REM sleep", "The craniosacral rhythm becomes perfectly symmetrical", "The emergence of heat, localized 'vibration,' or spontaneous positional changes in the tissue", "The client requests a deeper physical pressure"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tissue heat (thermic discharge), localized vibrations, or the body moving into a specific 'position of injury' are classic indicators that an emotional component is surfacing for release."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "What is the primary 'Therapeutic Utility' of inducing a Stillpoint at the beginning of a session for a highly stressed client?",
            "options": ["To diagnose a concussion", "To force the client to stop talking", "To act as a 'system reset' that shifts the client from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance", "To increase the amplitude of the craniosacral rhythm to its maximum level"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Stillpoint allows the Craniosacral System to pause and reorganize, effectively acting as a neurological reset that facilitates a shift into the restorative parasympathetic state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In a multi-session progression, what characterizes the 'Consolidation Phase' (typically sessions 4-6)?",
            "options": ["The initial intake and history taking", "The identification of the 'Primary Lesion'", "Stabilizing structural changes and increasing the time between sessions", "Referring the client to a different specialist"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Consolidation Phase focuses on ensuring the body holds its new, healthier patterns and begins to extend the therapeutic benefits over longer periods between treatments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Red Flag' that requires immediate cessation of CST and medical referral?",
            "options": ["A mild headache after a session", "A sudden, 'thunderclap' headache or signs of increased intracranial pressure", "The client feeling 'too relaxed' to drive", "A slight increase in the amplitude of the craniosacral rhythm"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sudden, severe headaches or signs of intracranial pressure (like pupil changes or sudden nausea) are red flags for potential neurological emergencies that contraindicate CST."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "When mapping a restriction using the P.U.L.S.E. Framework™, a 'Level 5' restriction usually signifies:",
            "options": ["A healthy, mobile tissue state", "A minor compensatory pattern", "A 'dead-end' or significant structural inertia that is likely the primary source of dysfunction", "A restriction that will resolve on its own without intervention"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On a scale of 1-5, a Level 5 restriction represents the highest degree of inertia or lack of movement, often pointing to the primary lesion or 'anchor' of the client's tension pattern."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic TMD (Temporomandibular Disorder). Your strategic plan involves 'unwinding' the jaw. Why must you ensure the thoracic inlet is clear first?",
            "options": ["The thoracic inlet contains the masseter muscles", "To ensure proper venous and lymphatic drainage from the head and neck", "Because the jaw cannot move if the shoulders are tight", "To increase the heart rate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The thoracic inlet is the 'drainage' point for the head and neck. If it is restricted, releasing the jaw can lead to congestion and increased pressure in the cranial vault due to poor drainage."
