            "question": "During a global assessment, the practitioner uses 'arcing' to identify the primary lesion. What is the practitioner specifically sensing for?",
            "options": [
                "The rebound of energy off a localized restriction or 'energy cyst'",
                "The direction of the fascial drag toward the feet",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Arcing is a global assessment tool used to locate the primary site of restriction by sensing the energetic 'rebound' or disruption in the body's field caused by a lesion."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'hard stop' or lack of mobility during dural tube traction suggests that the dura mater is restricted or tethered, often due to trauma or inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Quality describes the subjective feel of the rhythm, such as whether it is fluid, jerky, 'sticky,' or smooth, which provides insight into the vitality of the system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fascial drag assessment uses light pressure to 'skim' the tissue, identifying where the fascia resists movement, which points toward a restriction."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic pelvic pain. Arcing leads the practitioner to the sacrum, and palpation reveals a lack of CSR amplitude at the pelvic diaphragm. This is an example of:",

                "A systemic autonomic imbalance only",
                "A secondary restriction masking a primary cranial base lesion",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This demonstrates the clinical reasoning process: using global tools (arcing) to narrow the focus, then confirming with specific regional assessments (diaphragm palpation)."
