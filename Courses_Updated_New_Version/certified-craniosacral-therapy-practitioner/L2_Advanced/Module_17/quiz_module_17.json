            "question": "During a trauma-informed CST session (L2), a client begins to exhibit rapid breathing and eye fluttering, indicating a somatic flashback. What is the practitioner's immediate priority?",
            "options": [
                "Deepen the craniosacral hold to 'process' the trauma faster",
                "Apply the 'Stillpoint' technique to force the system into a rest state",
                "Gently use grounding techniques to orient the client to the present environment",
                "Immediately terminate the session and leave the room to give them space"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In trauma-informed care, the priority during a flashback is safety and stabilization. Grounding techniques help the client return to the 'Window of Tolerance' by orienting them to the present moment and their physical surroundings."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "When working with a pediatric client with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (L3), why are firm, predictable holds often preferred over light, fluttering contact?",
            "options": [
                "Children with ASD have thicker cranial bones",
                "Light touch can be overstimulating or perceived as 'noxious' to a hypersensitive nervous system",
                "Firm pressure is required to move the sphenobasilar synchondrosis in children",
                "Predictable holds are only used if the child is non-verbal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many children with ASD experience sensory processing challenges. Light, moving, or unpredictable touch can trigger a sympathetic 'fight or flight' response, whereas firm, static pressure is often more grounding and easier for their nervous system to integrate."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In geriatric CST (L4), a client presents with advanced osteoporosis and significant frailty. Which modification is most critical for safety?",
            "options": [
                "Avoiding all contact with the ribcage and spine",
                "Using 'feather-light' pressure (less than 5 grams) and avoiding mechanical leverage",
                "Increasing the duration of the session to 90 minutes to allow for slow tissue response",
                "Performing aggressive dural tube stretches to improve mobility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fragile geriatric patients require extreme caution. Using minimal pressure and avoiding any techniques that use the body as a lever reduces the risk of bone fractures or soft tissue injury in compromised systems."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Regarding post-surgical recovery (L5), what is the primary goal of using CST on scar tissue once the incision is fully healed?",
            "options": [
                "To physically pull the scar apart to increase length",
                "To encourage the integration of the scar into the global fascial web and reduce 'tugging' on distant structures",
                "To restart the inflammatory process to clear out old cells",
                "To eliminate the need for physical therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CST aims to integrate the scar tissue into the continuous fascial system, reducing the restrictive 'pull' that local scars can exert on the entire craniosacral system and body posture."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In the context of Chronic Pain Syndromes (L6), what does the term 'Central Sensitization' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The healing of a peripheral nerve injury",
                "A state where the central nervous system stays in a persistent state of high reactivity, lowering the pain threshold",
                "The process of the brain ignoring pain signals over time",
                "A psychological condition where the client imagines pain that does not exist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Central sensitization is a hallmark of chronic pain where the nervous system becomes 'wound up,' causing the brain to interpret even non-painful stimuli as painful (allodynia) or mild pain as severe (hyperalgesia)."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "When designing a long-term treatment plan for a client with multiple comorbidities (L1 & L8), why is 'pacing' sessions important?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner doesn't get bored with the case",
                "To prevent 'healing crises' or system overload in a client whose adaptive reserves are already low",
                "Because insurance only covers one session per month",
                "To make the treatment last as long as possible for financial gain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients with complex comorbidities often have limited 'adaptive capacity.' Overtreating can overwhelm their ability to integrate changes, leading to exhaustion or an exacerbation of symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "In autoimmune protocols (L7), why is it often recommended to work during 'remission' rather than 'acute flare' phases?",
            "options": [
                "CST is ineffective during a flare-up",
                "The goal during a flare is purely palliative (comfort), while the goal during remission is to improve systemic resilience",
                "Autoimmune conditions are contagious during flares",
                "The practitioner cannot feel the CSR during an inflammatory flare"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During an acute flare, the body is in a high-inflammatory state and needs soothing, minimal intervention. During remission, the practitioner can work more deeply with the underlying restrictions to build the system's overall resilience."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 6 suggests that CST may break the 'neural loop' of chronic pain by:",
            "options": [
                "Decreasing blood flow to the brain",
                "Providing a novel, non-threatening sensory input that downregulates the sympathetic nervous system",
                "Increasing the production of cortisol",
                "Mechanically blocking the pain receptors in the skin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CST provides the nervous system with a safe, gentle, and novel sensory experience. This can help 'reset' the neural pathways that have become habituated to pain signaling, promoting a shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a sign of 'Hypo-arousal' (the low end of the Window of Tolerance) during a complex CST session?",
            "options": [
                "Increased heart rate and sweating",
                "Emotional outbursts and shouting",
                "Numbness, dissociation, or a 'flat' affect",
                "Aggressive movements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by 'shutting down.' This includes dissociation, feeling numb, or appearing spaced out, indicating the client has moved outside their window of tolerance into a freeze/collapse state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "In clinical decision-making (L8), if a client with a complex history reaches a 'plateau' after 8 sessions, what is the best course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client CST is no longer working for them",
                "Increase the pressure of the holds significantly",
                "Re-evaluate the treatment goals and consider a 2-4 week 'integration break' from therapy",
                "Double the frequency of sessions to 'break through' the plateau"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Plateaus are common in complex cases. Often, the body needs time to integrate the changes made over several sessions without further input. A planned break or a re-evaluation of the treatment plan is the professional approach."
