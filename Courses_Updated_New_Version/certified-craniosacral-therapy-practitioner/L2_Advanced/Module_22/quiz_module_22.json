            "question": "In the context of Craniosacral Therapy, why is the 'power imbalance' considered an inherent ethical factor?",
            "options": [
                "Because the practitioner has more physical strength than the client.",
                "Because the client is in a reclined, vulnerable position while the practitioner remains seated and 'expert'.",
                "Because the practitioner is the only one who can feel the Craniosacral Rhythm.",
                "Because insurance companies require the practitioner to be the primary decision-maker."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional boundaries must account for the inherent power imbalance created by the client's physical vulnerability (lying down) and the practitioner's role as the clinical authority."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'E' in P.U.L.S.E. stands for Exit Strategy/Empowerment, ensuring the client knows they have the absolute right to pause or terminate the session for any reason."

                "Ask the client to sign an additional waiver before treating the headache."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Red-flag symptoms like 'thunderclap' headaches require immediate medical referral. Attempting to treat potential medical emergencies is a violation of the scope of practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ethics of SER require the practitioner to be a 'witness' and facilitator. Leading the client or imposing interpretations can interfere with the client's organic processing and create false memories."

            "options": [
                "Because practitioners who are burnt out are more likely to make clinical errors or boundary violations.",
                "Because clients prefer to work with practitioners who look healthy.",
                "Because it is a requirement for maintaining professional insurance.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Ethical Obligation of Self-Care' recognizes that a practitioner's physical and emotional state directly impacts their ability to provide safe, effective, and neutral care."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner projects their own emotions or needs onto the client. Recognizing this is vital for maintaining professional boundaries."
