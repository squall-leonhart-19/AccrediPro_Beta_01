            "options": [
                "The physical space or venue where the session occurs",
                "The energetic field created by the intersection of the practitioner's presence and the collective group field",

                "The specific CST technique being applied to the group simultaneously"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Third Presence is the emergent collective field that arises when individual nervous systems begin to entrain and synchronize during a group session."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A collective stillpoint is marked by a visible 'settling' where the group's respiratory rates slow and the autonomic nervous systems transition into a shared parasympathetic state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective CST workshops require a heavy emphasis on hands-on practice and integration (roughly 70%) to ensure participants can palpate the craniosacral rhythm effectively."

                "Ignore the individual to avoid giving the behavior 'energy'",

                "Ask the participant to leave the room until they are quiet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The facilitator must ground the individual (containment) while ensuring the rest of the group feels safe and the collective field remains intact."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Corporate niches value 'hard' data; demonstrating improvements in stress markers and HRV provides a tangible Return on Investment (ROI) for the company."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In group settings, participants must acknowledge that while the practitioner maintains confidentiality, the presence of other participants creates a shared environment where absolute privacy cannot be guaranteed by the provider."

                "To foster long-term community and provide ongoing integration support after a major workshop",
                "To replace the need for 1-on-1 clinical sessions entirely",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Continuity programs (like monthly circles or memberships) ensure that the shifts made during a workshop are integrated into the participant's daily life through ongoing community support."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-intensity group work can be dysregulating for those with acute PTSD or psychosis; these individuals require the specialized, 1-on-1 containment of a clinical setting."
