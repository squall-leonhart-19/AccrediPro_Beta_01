            "question": "In the 'Strategic Architecture' of EFT, what is the primary risk of focusing solely on 'Global' issues like 'I have low self-esteem'?",
            "options": [
                "The client will experience too much emotional intensity too quickly",
                "The practitioner will be unable to find specific 'Table Legs' to collapse the issue",
                "The SUDs levels will drop too fast to be accurately measured",
                "It violates the ethical guidelines of the ASI standards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Global issues are 'Table Tops.' Without identifying the specific events (Table Legs) that support the global belief, the tapping remains too general to create permanent neural shifts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional Landscape Mapping involves identifying the recurring emotional themes and specific events that connect a client's past experiences to their current symptoms."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When navigating complex trauma layers (Strategic Sequencing), why is it often recommended to use 'Gentle Techniques' like the Movie Technique first?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client can reach a SUDs of 10 safely",
                "To bypass the need for a Setup Statement",
                "To prevent abreaction and keep the client within their Window of Tolerance",
                "Because direct tapping is only used for physical pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle techniques allow the practitioner to 'test the waters' and minimize the risk of flooding or abreaction when dealing with highly charged traumatic memories."

                "At the very beginning of the session to set a positive tone",
                "When the SUDs level is at an 8 or 9 to provide relief",
                "Only after the SUDs level for the specific intensity has dropped to 0-2",
                "When the client expresses 'Psychological Reversal' (PR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A cognitive reframe is rarely effective if the emotional intensity is high. The 'Pivot' occurs after the intensity is cleared, allowing the brain to be receptive to new perspectives."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A client is making progress on their fear of public speaking, but their SUDs level plateaus at a 4. They mention, 'If I'm not afraid, my boss will give me more responsibilities I can't handle.' This is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain occurs when the subconscious perceives a benefit or safety in maintaining the problem (in this case, avoiding extra work/responsibility)."

            "options": [
                "Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs)",
                "The Karash-Mauer Scale",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clinical populations like veterans, safety is paramount. Using 'Sneaking Up' techniques prevents the client from being overwhelmed by intense combat-related triggers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In SOAP notes (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), the 'Plan' outlines the next steps in treatment, including which 'Table Legs' to address next."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a 'Daisy Chain' of memories. If they collapse the 'sturdiest' or most significant memory in the chain, what is the likely outcome?",
            "options": [
                "The Generalization Effect will likely weaken or collapse the other memories",
                "The client will forget the other memories entirely",
                "The practitioner must still tap on every single memory individually",
                "The SUDs of the other memories will automatically increase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Generalization Effect in EFT means that clearing a core, significant memory often reduces the intensity of related memories in the same 'chain' or theme."

                "The client has run out of insurance coverage",
                "The client's SUDs levels are consistently 0 across all identified 'Table Legs' for the presenting issue",
                "The practitioner feels they have nothing more to teach the client",
                "The client has completed exactly 10 sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Termination is appropriate when the specific goals of the treatment plan have been met, evidenced by consistent 0 SUDs and high VOC across the mapped emotional landscape."
