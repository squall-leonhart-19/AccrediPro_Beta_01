            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ethical risk of the Pivot phase is 'bypassing,' where the practitioner pushes for a positive reframe before the emotional intensity has been sufficiently neutralized, effectively silencing the client's pain."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Expert-Lead' trap occurs when a practitioner acts as the 'healer' rather than the 'facilitator,' causing the client to rely on the practitioner's authority rather than their own internal signals."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Self-care is ethical because a practitioner suffering from STS or burnout cannot maintain the presence, empathy, and safety required to hold space for a client's trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital fatigue can decrease a practitioner's 'somatic attunement,' making it harder to spot the subtle physical signs that a client is becoming overwhelmed or dissociated."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical standards require the disclosure and thorough discussion of dual relationships to ensure that the power dynamics of one role do not negatively impact the therapeutic efficacy of the tapping sessions."
