            "options": [
                "The ability to move through all seven steps in a rigid, linear sequence without deviation.",
                "The practitioner's capacity to pivot between phases based on real-time somatic and emotional cues from the client.",
                "The speed at which a practitioner can complete a full tapping round.",
                "A specific technique used only for clients with high dissociative tendencies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluidity refers to the 'Art of EFT,' where the practitioner moves seamlessly between the T.A.P.P.I.N.G. phases based on the client's immediate needs rather than following a rigid script."

            "question": "According to the 'Art of the Pivot' in Lesson 2, what is the prerequisite for introducing a Cognitive Reframe?",
            "options": [
                "The client must have a SUDs level of at least 8.",
                "The practitioner must have completed at least four rounds of the Setup Statement.",
                "The emotional intensity (SUDs) must be sufficiently lowered, typically to a 4 or below, to ensure the prefrontal cortex is online.",
                "The client must explicitly ask for a new perspective on their problem."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reframing is ineffective when a client is in a high-arousal state (high SUDs) because the 'emotional brain' is dominant; the intensity must be lowered for the reframe to be cognitively integrated."

                "To distract the client from the physical sensations of the trauma.",
                "To ensure the client forgets the details of the traumatic event entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Integration phase focuses on Memory Reconsolidation—pairing the formerly distressing memory with a new, calm physiological state to permanently alter the neural trace."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "A client consistently reaches a SUDs of 2 but cannot clear the remaining intensity. They admit that if they are 'fully healed,' their family might stop supporting them. This is a classic example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary Gain occurs when the subconscious perceives a benefit or protection in maintaining the problem, such as receiving attention, care, or financial support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing acts as a 'litmus test' by asking the client to mentally rehearse a future scenario to see if any residual emotional intensity or 'Tail-Enders' remain."

                "It is a specific physical symptom that appears during every session.",
                "It is the underlying belief (e.g., 'I am not safe') that links multiple seemingly unrelated traumatic events.",
                "It is the name of the specific tapping protocol used for PTSD."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Core Themes are the 'connective tissue' of complex trauma; addressing the theme can often collapse multiple related 'legs' of the trauma table simultaneously."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "The sound the practitioner makes while humming during tapping.",
                "A state of deep emotional attunement where the practitioner’s regulated nervous system helps stabilize the client’s.",
                "A specific tapping point located near the limbic system.",
                "The ability to memorize all of the client's past history."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limbic Resonance is a key aspect of presence, where the practitioner's calm state provides a 'biological mirror' for the client, facilitating safety and co-regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychological Reversal is addressed by tapping the Karate Chop point (or rubbing the Sore Spot) to 'reset' the system and acknowledge the subconscious conflict."

            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "During a session, you notice the client's eyes darting and their breathing becoming shallow as they recount a memory. Using 'Advanced Grounding,' your first priority should be:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount; if a client begins to dissociate or hyper-arouse, the practitioner must use grounding and orienting to bring them back into their 'Window of Tolerance' before continuing."
