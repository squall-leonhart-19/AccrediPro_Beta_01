            "question": "When working with Complex PTSD (CPTSD) as discussed in Lesson 1, what is the 'Safety First' protocol's primary objective before addressing core traumatic memories?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to relive the event in high detail",
                "To establish emotional regulation and 'titrate' the intensity to prevent flooding/retraumatization",
                "To complete the entire trauma history in the first 30 minutes",
                "To ignore the trauma and focus only on positive affirmations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In CPTSD cases, safety is paramount. Practitioners must use titration—breaking the trauma into tiny, manageable pieces—to ensure the client stays within their window of tolerance and avoids being overwhelmed (flooding)."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 regarding Chronic Pain and Somatic Memory, what does the concept 'The Body Keeps the Score' suggest about physical symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Physical pain is always a result of direct physical impact only",
                "Unresolved emotional trauma can be 'locked' in the body's tissues, manifesting as chronic pain or tension",
                "Pain is purely an imaginary construct with no biological basis",
                "The body eventually forgets trauma after 7 years of cell regeneration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic memory refers to the body's ability to store the physiological remnants of trauma. EFT addresses the emotional 'charge' behind the physical symptom to facilitate relief."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "What is a 'Tail-Ender' in the context of financial scarcity and core beliefs (Lesson 3)?",
            "options": [
                "The last tapping point in a standard sequence",
                "A physical sensation felt in the lower back during tapping",
                "The 'yes, but...' internal objection or limiting belief that follows a positive affirmation",
                "A client who arrives late to their coaching sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tail-Enders are the subconscious objections (e.g., '...but I'm not smart enough') that arise when a person states a goal or affirmation. These are the specific targets for tapping."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "When using the 'Movie Technique' for acute phobias (Lesson 4), what should the practitioner do if the client's SUDs level is high before the 'movie' even begins?",
            "options": [
                "Instruct the client to watch the movie anyway to 'face their fear'",
                "Stop the session and refer them to a psychiatrist immediately",
                "Use the 'Sneaking Up' or 'Tearless Trauma' technique to reduce the anticipatory anxiety first",
                "Tell the client to imagine a different, happier movie instead"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If the anticipatory anxiety is too high, the practitioner must 'sneak up' on the problem by tapping on the fear of the memory before actually viewing the memory itself."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Upper Limit Problem' (Lesson 5), why might a high-performance client experience a sudden setback after a major achievement?",
            "options": [
                "They have reached their biological maximum potential",
                "They have hit an internal 'thermostat' of how much success and joy they feel safe handling",
                "They are naturally prone to failure",
                "The market conditions always fluctuate after a success"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gay Hendricks' 'Upper Limit Problem' suggests we have an internal setting for how much success we allow ourselves. When we exceed it, we often self-sabotage to return to our 'comfort zone' of familiar struggle."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, what is identified as a common 'block' to resolving Complicated Bereavement with EFT?",
            "options": [
                "The client being too happy",
                "The belief that letting go of the pain means letting go of the connection to the deceased",
                "Tapping on the wrong points",
                "Using EFT too soon after the loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many grieving clients subconsciously hold onto pain as a way to maintain a link to the loved one. EFT helps decouple the 'love' from the 'suffering' so they can remember the person without the trauma."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "The 'Urge Surfing' protocol in addiction recovery (Lesson 7) teaches clients to:",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the craving until it disappears",
                "Use tapping to observe the craving as a passing wave without acting on the impulse",
                "Substitute one addiction for a healthier one like exercise",
                "Only tap when they are in a state of 'cold' cognition (not craving)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urge Surfing involves using EFT to stay present with the physical sensations of a craving, watching it rise, peak, and subside like a wave, rather than fighting or succumbing to it."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Which adaptation is most appropriate when using Pediatric EFT for a young child (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": [
                "Requiring the child to sit still for 45 minutes",

                "Insisting the child use the exact standard setup phrase word-for-word"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children respond well to externalization. Using a stuffed animal (Tapping Teddy) allows them to project their feelings onto the toy, making the process feel safer and more engaging."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client with chronic migraines notices the pain spikes when they feel 'unheard' at work. According to Lesson 2, this specific emotional trigger is known as:",
            "options": [
                "A placebo effect",
                "An emotional contributor to a somatic symptom",
                "A purely neurological dysfunction",
                "A 'Tail-Ender' for wealth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying the specific emotional theme (being unheard) that correlates with a physical symptom (migraine) is a key strategy in advanced somatic EFT work."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of using 'The Movie Technique' for a specific traumatic event?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the session more entertaining for the practitioner",
                "It allows for a systematic, safe review of the event, stopping to tap on every 'crescendo' of intensity",
                "It encourages the client to exaggerate the story",
                "It replaces the need for any other EFT techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Movie Technique provides a structured way to process a memory by pausing at every 'bad part' (crescendo) to tap the SUDs down to zero before moving forward, ensuring thorough resolution."
