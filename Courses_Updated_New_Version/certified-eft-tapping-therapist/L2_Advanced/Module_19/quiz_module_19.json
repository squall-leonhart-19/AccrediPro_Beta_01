            "question": "According to the APA Division 12 Task Force standards discussed in Lesson 1, what is a requirement for a therapy to be classified as 'Efficacious'?",
            "options": [
                "It must be superior to a waitlist control group in at least two independent settings.",
                "It must be superior to a pill or psychological placebo or to another bona fide treatment in at least two independent settings.",
                "It must have a minimum of 500 peer-reviewed case studies published in the last decade.",
                "It must be practiced by at least 10,000 certified clinicians worldwide."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To be classified as 'Efficacious' (the highest standard), a treatment must be shown to be superior to a placebo or another established treatment in at least two high-quality independent research trials."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "fMRI and EEG studies show that tapping on acupoints sends a calming signal to the amygdala, down-regulating the body's fight-or-flight response even while the stressor is being recalled."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In the landmark 2016 study by Church et al. on epigenetics, a single 60-minute EFT session was found to significantly modulate the expression of how many genes?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses consistently show that EFT has a 'Large' effect size (often exceeding 0.8) for depression, meaning the magnitude of improvement is significant compared to standard care."

                "EFT only works for sweet cravings, not savory ones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike many weight loss interventions, EFT studies show that the reduction in food cravings and associated weight loss are maintained or even improve at one-year follow-up intervals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Higher HRV is a marker of a healthy, resilient autonomic nervous system and indicates that the body has shifted from a 'fight or flight' state to a 'rest and digest' state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By stimulating acupoints while focusing on a traumatic memory, EFT interrupts the reconsolidation of the fear response, essentially 'unpairing' the memory from the physiological stress signal."
