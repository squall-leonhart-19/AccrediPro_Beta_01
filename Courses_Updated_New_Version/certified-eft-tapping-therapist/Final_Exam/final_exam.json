            "question": "According to The T.A.P.P.I.N.G. Method™, what is the primary objective of the 'T' (Target) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To apply the tapping sequence on all meridian points simultaneously.",
                "To identify the specific emotional trigger, physical sensation, or traumatic memory to be addressed.",
                "To transition the client into a state of cognitive reframing.",
                "To measure the final intensity of the distress after the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'T' in T.A.P.P.I.N.G. stands for Target, which focuses on isolating a specific issue—whether it is a sensory memory, a physical pain, or an emotional trigger—to ensure the tapping is focused and effective."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "During the 'A' (Assess) phase, a practitioner uses the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs) scale. What does a SUDs score of 10 typically represent?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SUDs scale, ranging from 0 to 10, measures the intensity of negative emotions or physical sensations. A 10 represents maximum intensity, providing a baseline for the Assess phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "Research cited in Module 19 indicates that EFT tapping significantly impacts the endocrine system. A 2020 meta-analysis found that EFT sessions can reduce cortisol levels by approximately what percentage?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including the landmark 2020 meta-analysis by Bach et al., have shown that EFT can reduce cortisol levels (the primary stress hormone) by 37% to 43%, significantly outperforming talk therapy and rest."

        {
            "id": "final_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Process' phase works by dual-attention stimulation: the client focuses on the stressor (activating the amygdala) while tapping sends a soothing signal to the brain, effectively 'de-programming' the fear response."

        {
            "id": "final_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pivot phase occurs only after the initial distress has lowered. It involves shifting the perspective from the problem to the solution or a more empowered cognitive state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During an abreaction (an intense emotional release), the practitioner should keep the client tapping (or tap for them if permitted) to help regulate the nervous system and bring them back to a state of safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neutralize is the 'cleanup' phase where the practitioner scans for 'tail-enders' or secondary aspects of the issue that may prevent full resolution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Movie Technique allows the client to process a memory with 'distancing' by viewing it as a movie, stopping to tap whenever a specific 'crescendo' or high-intensity moment occurs."
