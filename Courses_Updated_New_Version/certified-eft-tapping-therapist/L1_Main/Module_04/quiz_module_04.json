            "question": "In the context of the EFT 'Pivot' phase, what is the fundamental shift occurring in the client's processing?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from physical tapping to purely mental visualization",
                "Shifting from emotional release (de-arousal) to cognitive restructuring (reframing)",
                "Moving from the 'Setup' phrase to the 'Reminder' phrase",
                "Shifting from the client's perspective to the therapist's perspective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pivot phase represents the transition from clearing the emotional charge (release) to installing new, more adaptive perspectives (reframing)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the 'SUDs Threshold' guidelines in Lesson 2, what is the maximum recommended SUDs level for a successful and lasting cognitive pivot?",
            "options": [
                "A SUDs of 7, to ensure the emotion is still 'active'",
                "A SUDs of 5, as this represents the neutral midpoint",
                "A SUDs of 3 or lower, to ensure the prefrontal cortex is online and receptive",
                "The SUDs level does not matter as long as the client is willing to try"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pivoting when intensity is above a 3 often leads to 'cognitive dissonance' or 'apex problems,' where the client cannot believe the new reframe because the amygdala is still too active."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which reframing technique involves changing the 'size' or 'context' of a problem to make it feel more manageable?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Yes, But' Bridge",
                "Contextual Reframing",

                "Somatic Integration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Contextual reframing changes the perspective or 'frame' around an event, helping the client see it in a different light or broader context."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "What is a 'Tail-Ender' in the context of crafting affirmations during the Pivot phase?",
            "options": [
                "The final tapping point used in a sequence",
                "A physical twitch at the end of a session",
                "The internal 'subconscious objection' or 'Yes, but...' that follows a positive statement",
                "The concluding sentence of the therapist's summary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tail-enders are the internal whispers of doubt (e.g., 'I am worthy... NO YOU AREN'T') that indicate more tapping is needed on specific limiting beliefs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A client is struggling to accept a positive reframe, repeatedly saying 'I know it's not my fault, but I still feel like I should have done something.' Which technique is best suited for this 'bridge' phase?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Yes, But...' Bridge",
                "Forceful Affirmations",
                "Paradoxical Laughter",
                "Stopping the session immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Yes, But...' Bridge validates the current feeling while gently introducing the possibility of a new one, reducing psychological reversal."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Somatic Marker' that a cognitive shift has successfully occurred?",
            "options": [
                "Increased muscle tension in the shoulders",
                "A spontaneous, involuntary deep sigh or yawn",
                "The client looking down and to the left",
                "A rapid increase in heart rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Involuntary deep breaths, sighs, or yawning are classic physiological indicators that the autonomic nervous system has shifted from sympathetic (stress) to parasympathetic (relaxation/integration)."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "When using humor or paradox in advanced reframing (Lesson 7), what is the primary therapeutic goal?",
            "options": [
                "To make the client feel silly for having the problem",
                "To entertain the client and make the session more enjoyable",
                "To create a 'pattern interrupt' that breaks the loop of the trauma narrative",
                "To show the client that their problems are not actually serious"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Humor and paradox act as pattern interrupts, making it difficult for the brain to maintain the same rigid, stressful neural pathways associated with the memory."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Why is 'Toxic Positivity' dangerous during the Pivot phase?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the session go too quickly",
                "It bypasses the client's authentic experience and can cause 'emotional bypassing'",
                "It is too expensive for the client",
                "It prevents the therapist from using the 'Yes, But' bridge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Toxic positivity forces a positive outlook before the emotional charge has been neutralized, which usually results in the client feeling misunderstood or the reframe failing to 'stick.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client reports a SUDs of 2 regarding a childhood memory. You suggest the reframe: 'Even though it happened, I am safe now.' The client winces and says, 'That doesn't feel true.' What should the therapist do?",
            "options": [
                "Repeat the phrase louder and more confidently",
                "Tell the client they are being resistant",
                "Backtrack to the 'Release' phase or use a 'Yes, But' bridge to find a more believable 'stepping stone' phrase",
                "Move immediately to the Integration phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a reframe doesn't feel true, it's a sign that either the SUDs isn't actually low enough or the reframe is too 'big' of a jump. A 'stepping stone' or 'bridge' phrase is required."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "What marks the transition from the P (Pivot) phase to the I (Integrate) phase in the EFT process?",
            "options": [
                "When the client stops crying",
                "When the 60-minute session timer is up",
                "When the new reframe is fully accepted (SUDs 0) and the client begins to naturally apply it to future scenarios",
                "When the therapist introduces the 'Setup' phrase for the second time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transition to Integration occurs when the cognitive shift is stable and the client can visualize future scenarios without the old emotional trigger."
