            "question": "In the 'Science of Subjective Measurement,' why is the SUDs scale (0-10) considered a reliable clinical tool despite being subjective?",
            "options": [
                "It provides a standardized objective measurement equivalent to a blood test.",
                "It activates the prefrontal cortex to monitor amygdala arousal, facilitating emotional regulation.",
                "It is only used for placebo effect monitoring in clinical trials.",
                "It allows the therapist to dictate how the client should be feeling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The act of assigning a number (SUDs) requires 'affect labeling,' which engages the prefrontal cortex and helps dampen amygdala reactivity, bridging the gap between emotional experience and cognitive processing."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client reports a SUDs of 7 regarding a specific memory. After one round of tapping, they say, 'I feel fine now, it's a 2.' However, you notice their fists are still clenched. This is an example of why we use:",
            "options": [

                "Clinical Calibration",

                "Psychological Reversal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical Calibration (Lesson 4) is the process of observing non-verbal cues (like clenched fists) that may contradict a client's verbal SUDs report, ensuring the therapist assesses the true internal state."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Body's Emotional Map' (Lesson 3), where is 'unexpressed anger' most commonly localized somatically?",
            "options": [
                "The lower back and knees",
                "The stomach and digestive tract",
                "The jaw, neck, and shoulders",
                "The crown of the head"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic assessment frequently identifies anger and frustration in the jaw (bruxism/tension), neck, and shoulders, representing the 'fight' impulse of the sympathetic nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "When a client repeatedly says 'I don't know' during the assessment of an emotion, which technique from Lesson 5 is recommended to bypass this cognitive block?",
            "options": [
                "Ending the session immediately to avoid resistance.",
                "Asking the client to 'take a wild guess' or 'make it up.'",
                "Telling the client they aren't ready for EFT.",
                "Increasing the pressure of the tapping points."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asking a client to 'guess' or 'make it up' lowers the pressure of 'getting it right,' allowing the subconscious to provide somatic or emotional data that the conscious mind was filtering."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Aspects' are described as the different 'layers' of an issue. If a client taps on the 'fear of a car accident' and the SUDs drops, but they suddenly feel 'guilt about the passenger,' what has happened?",
            "options": [
                "The EFT has failed to work.",
                "The client is experiencing an abreaction.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Shifting Aspect occurs when one layer of an issue is resolved, allowing a different component (e.g., shifting from fear to guilt) to surface for processing."

            "question": "What is the primary role of assessment in ensuring 'Client Safety' (Lesson 7)?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client pays for the session in advance.",
                "To identify if the client is at risk of flooding or dissociation before deep processing begins.",
                "To diagnose the client with a specific DSM-5 mental disorder.",
                "To determine if the client is lying about their symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessment allows the therapist to gauge the client's emotional regulation capacity. If a SUDs is a '10+' or the client shows signs of dissociation, the therapist must use grounding techniques rather than diving into deep trauma."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Non-Verbal Cue' that typically indicates a shift in the nervous system during tapping?",

                "A spontaneous deep breath or sigh.",
                "Eyes rapidly darting around the room.",
                "Increased muscle tension in the legs.",
                "The client checking their watch."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A spontaneous deep breath, sigh, or yawning are classic physiological indicators that the autonomic nervous system is shifting from sympathetic (fight/flight) to parasympathetic (rest/digest) dominance."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "During the 'Transitioning' phase (Lesson 8), what must be established before moving from 'Assess' to 'Process'?",
            "options": [
                "A complete 20-page history of the client's life.",
                "A clear target (emotion, sensation, or memory) and an initial SUDs score.",
                "A guarantee that the client will never feel pain again.",
                "The therapist's personal opinion on the client's problem."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition to processing requires a specific 'Target' (the 'What') and a baseline SUDs (the 'How much') to measure the effectiveness of the intervention."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'generalized anxiety.' According to Lesson 6, how should a therapist assess this to make it 'tap-able'?",
            "options": [
                "Tap on the words 'generalized anxiety' for the whole session.",
                "Differentiate the anxiety into specific events, bodily sensations, or 'aspects.'",
                "Tell the client to come back when they have a more specific problem.",
                "Assume the anxiety is caused by caffeine intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Global issues like 'anxiety' are often too broad for effective EFT. Differentiating the issue into specific 'aspects' (e.g., 'the tightness in my chest' or 'the memory of the meeting') allows for targeted, successful processing."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What does a SUDs score of '0' signify in the EFT assessment process?",
            "options": [
                "The client is bored.",
                "The specific aspect being measured no longer carries emotional charge.",
                "The session is over and the client is cured of all problems.",
                "The therapist made a mistake in the assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A SUDs of 0 indicates that the specific aspect or target currently being addressed has reached a state of neutral emotional intensity, though other aspects of the larger issue may still remain."
