            "options": [
                "Moving from reducing the intensity of a 'fire' to extinguishing the remaining 'embers' or remnants.",
                "Shifting focus from the emotional aspect to the physical symptoms exclusively.",
                "Discontinuing the use of the Setup Statement to focus only on the Reminder Phrase.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neutralization is about clearing the subtle remnants (embers) that remain after the high-intensity emotional charge (the fire) has been reduced."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic Resonance refers to the residual physical tension that lingers even when the cognitive or emotional SUDs appear to be at zero."

            "options": [
                "Continue tapping on the anger until the sadness goes away on its own.",
                "Treat the sadness as a new, distinct aspect and shift the tapping focus to it.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EFT is a layer-by-layer process; when a new emotion (aspect) emerges, it must be addressed as the new target for neutralization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Tail-enders are the subconscious objections or 'inner critics' that arise when we try to install a positive belief or affirmation."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Why is the transition from a SUDs of 2 to a SUDs of 0 often considered the most critical part of the Neutralization phase?",
            "options": [
                "Because remnants at level 2 provide the 'seed' for the emotional intensity to return later.",
                "Because level 2 is where the client is most likely to experience a 'healing crisis.'",
                "Because the therapist's insurance only covers sessions that reach zero.",
                "Because level 2 indicates the client is resisting the process intentionally."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Getting to a true zero is essential for permanence; even a level 1 or 2 can allow the original emotional pattern to reconstruct itself over time."

                "Ignore the color and focus on the physical pain.",
                "Use Sensory Neutralization to tap specifically on the 'vividness' of the red color.",
                "Assume the work is done because the fear is gone.",

            "explanation": "Sensory echoes (visual, auditory, etc.) can act as triggers; neutralizing the sensory vividness is key to full resolution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vividness Challenge or 'trying to make it happen' is the gold standard for verifying that an issue has been truly neutralized."

                "Introduce 'Choice' statements or 'What if' tapping to bridge the gap to positivity.",

                "Start over from the beginning of the module.",
                "Tell the client they are not ready for emotional freedom."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Once neutralized (at zero), the 'Void' provides an opportunity to use 'Choices' (Pat Carrington's method) to install positive alternatives."

            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah' (Module 6, L5), she reached a SUDs of 1 regarding her public speaking fear. What specific remnant was found to be the 'last two points'?",
            "options": [
                "The temperature of the room.",
                "A specific 'smirk' on a colleague's face in the front row.",
                "The sound of her own voice shaking.",
                "The feeling of her shoes being too tight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In many clinical applications, the final remnant is a specific, tiny visual or auditory detail—like a smirk—that holds the last 1-2 points of intensity."
