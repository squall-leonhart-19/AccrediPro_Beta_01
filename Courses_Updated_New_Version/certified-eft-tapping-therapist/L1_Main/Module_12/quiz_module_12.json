            "question": "In the 'Chasing the Pain' technique, what is the practitioner primarily tracking as the client taps?",
            "options": [
                "The chronological order of the traumatic event",
                "The shift in location, quality, or intensity of a physical sensation",
                "The client's cognitive understanding of why the pain exists",
                "The specific meridians that correspond to the affected organ"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chasing the Pain involves following the physical sensation as it moves or changes (e.g., from a 'sharp' pain in the neck to a 'dull' ache in the shoulder) to uncover deeper emotional layers."

            "options": [
                "The brightness of the room where the session takes place",
                "The clarity of the client's memory of the last time they indulged",
                "The intensity of the sensory experience (smell, taste, sight) during the craving",
                "The speed at which the client taps on the points"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To effectively collapse a craving, the practitioner must help the client evoke the 'vividness' of the sensory experience (smell, texture, taste) to ensure the neurological trigger is active while tapping."

                "Visualize a future challenging scenario while maintaining a SUDs of 0",

                "Identify at least three people who will support their new behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing uses the Mental Movie technique to test the work. If a client can visualize a previously triggering future event and remain at a SUDs of 0, the emotional regulation has been successfully integrated."

            "id": "q12_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Apex Effect occurs when a client experiences a profound change but their conscious mind cannot bridge the gap between 'tapping on skin' and 'healing,' leading them to dismiss the results as coincidental."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Pivot is the art of moving from the acknowledgement of the negative state to a neutral or positive reframe (e.g., 'Even though I have this fear... I choose to consider I might be safe')."

                "Ask the client to explain exactly what they are feeling",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During an abreaction, the most important step is to keep the tapping going. This helps down-regulate the amygdala and process the high-intensity emotion safely rather than 'freezing' it by stopping."

                "By increasing melatonin production through the eye-roll point",
                "By clearing the emotional 'loops' of unfinished tasks or thoughts that keep the brain alert",
                "By physically exhausting the client through rapid tapping",
                "By focusing on the physical sensation of the bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Zeigarnik Effect refers to the brain's tendency to remember uncompleted tasks. EFT helps 'close' these cognitive loops, allowing the nervous system to transition from sympathetic (alert) to parasympathetic (rest)."

                "Closing and Homework Assignment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While intake and closing are vital, the core 'Work'—active tapping on specific aspects and memories—should take up the majority (35-45 minutes) of a professional session."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client is skeptical about EFT, calling it 'woo-woo.' What is the most effective way to start the session based on Module 12's clinical strategies?",
            "options": [
                "Show them a 20-minute PowerPoint on neuroscience",
                "Tap on the skepticism itself: 'Even though I think this is ridiculous...'",
                "Tell them they must believe in it for it to work",
                "Ignore the comment and start tapping on their primary issue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tapping on the 'truth' of the moment—the skepticism—is the most effective way to build rapport and lower the client's resistance, often leading to a surprise 'Apex Effect' later."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "When 'Chasing the Pain,' a client reports that their headache moved from their forehead to the base of their skull. What should the practitioner do next?",
            "options": [
                "Continue tapping on the forehead because that's where it started",
                "Stop and ask about their childhood relationship with their father",
                "Change the reminder phrase to target the 'pain at the base of the skull'",
                "Tell the client that the tapping isn't working because the pain is moving"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When pain moves, it is a sign of progress. The practitioner should immediately 'chase' it by updating the language to reflect the new location and quality of the sensation."
