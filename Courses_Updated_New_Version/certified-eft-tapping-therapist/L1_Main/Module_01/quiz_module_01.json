            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, why is 'Global Tapping' (e.g., 'Even though I have anxiety') often discouraged in professional EFT practice?",
            "options": [
                "It requires too many tapping points to be effective",
                "It fails to activate the specific neural pathways associated with the root trigger",
                "It is only effective for physical pain, not emotional issues",
                "It causes the 'Generalization Effect' to happen too quickly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specificity is the 'Golden Rule' of EFT because it allows the practitioner to isolate and desensitize the specific neural networks and memories driving the emotional response, whereas global statements are often too vague to create lasting shifts."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "When acting as an 'Emotional Detective' (Lesson 2), what does the 'Core Trigger' usually represent?",
            "options": [
                "The person the client is currently most angry with",
                "The physical location where the client feels the most pain",
                "The specific moment or sensory detail that caused the emotional spike",
                "A summary of the client's entire childhood history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Core Trigger is the 'point of impact'—the specific sensory detail (a look, a word, a sound) that caused the nervous system to react. Finding this allows for precision in the tapping process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client is unable to identify or name their emotion. According to 'The Body as a Map' (Lesson 3), what should the practitioner use as the target?",
            "options": [
                "A generic emotion like 'stress'",
                "The physical sensation and its location in the body",
                "A childhood memory of a similar feeling",
                "The client's cognitive thoughts about the situation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic targets (e.g., 'this tightness in my chest') provide a direct entry point to the nervous system when a client is alexithymic or emotionally disconnected, serving as a concrete 'anchor' for the tapping."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In the 'Movie Technique' (Lesson 4), what is the primary purpose of having the client 'freeze-frame' the movie?",
            "options": [
                "To prolong the session and increase billable hours",
                "To prevent the client from becoming too overwhelmed by the story",
                "To identify the specific 'Zing' or peak of intensity within a sensory snapshot",
                "To allow the practitioner time to take notes on the client's history"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Freeze-framing allows the practitioner to isolate the most intense sensory aspects (the 'Zings') of a memory, ensuring that each specific aspect is neutralized before moving on."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Using the 'Tabletop Metaphor' (Lesson 5), if 'I'm not good enough' is the tabletop, what do the 'legs' represent?",
            "options": [
                "The client's future goals and aspirations",
                "The different people who have told the client they are not good enough",
                "Specific past events or memories that support and reinforce that belief",
                "The physical symptoms of the belief, such as fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The tabletop is the global belief, and the legs are the specific limiting memories that hold it up. By 'collapsing' the legs (tapping on specific memories), the global belief eventually loses its foundation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A client says, 'I can still hear the sharp tone in my boss's voice.' Which VAK sensory channel (Lesson 6) is the primary target here?",
            "options": [
                "Visual",
                "Auditory",
                "Kinesthetic",
                "Olfactory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The mention of 'hearing' and 'tone' indicates an Auditory target. Using the client's specific sensory language ('sharp tone') in the setup phrase increases the effectiveness of the tapping."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "When a client presents with a vague issue like 'I just feel off today' (Lesson 7), which question is most effective for narrowing the target?",
            "options": [
                "How long have you felt this way?",
                "If you could give this 'off' feeling a color and a shape, what would it be?",
                "Who else in your life makes you feel this way?",
                "What would happen if you didn't feel off?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Giving a vague sensation a color, shape, or texture (somatic metaphor) turns an abstract feeling into a concrete target that the brain can more easily process and release."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Selection & Prioritization, which memory should usually be targeted first to maximize the 'Generalization Effect'?",
            "options": [
                "The most recent memory, regardless of intensity",
                "The memory with the lowest SUD score to build confidence",
                "The earliest or most emotionally intense memory related to the issue",
                "The memory that involves the fewest number of people"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Targeting the 'foundational' memory (the earliest) or the one with the highest emotional charge (the most intense) often causes similar, less intense memories to collapse simultaneously through the generalization effect."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "In a 2023 meta-analysis mentioned in the module, specific targeting in EFT was shown to reduce cortisol levels by what average percentage compared to talk therapy?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "24%",
                "37%",
                "43%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that clinical EFT, which emphasizes specific targeting, can reduce cortisol levels by up to 43%, significantly outperforming traditional talk therapy in physiological stress reduction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A client wants to work on 'Fear of Public Speaking.' Which of the following is the most 'target-ready' setup phrase?",
            "options": [
                "Even though I'm afraid to speak in front of people...",
                "Even though I felt a sharp knot in my stomach when I saw the microphone on the podium this morning...",
                "Even though I've always been a shy person and it's hard for me...",
                "Even though my presentation didn't go well and I'm worried about my job..."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This option is the most specific because it identifies a somatic sensation ('sharp knot'), a specific location ('stomach'), and a specific trigger ('saw the microphone on the podium this morning')."
