                "Advanced Assessment",
                "Affirmation Alignment",
                "Amygdala Adjustment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'A' stands for Advanced Assessment, which focuses on measuring the SUDs (Subjective Units of Distress) spectrum and identifying the specific emotional nuances of the client's experience."

            "question": "Using the 'Table Metaphor' in Precision Targeting (Lesson 2), if the 'Table Top' is the global issue (e.g., 'I'm not good enough'), what do the 'Table Legs' represent?",
            "options": [
                "The physiological symptoms of the issue",
                "The client's future goals and aspirations",
                "Specific events or memories that support the global belief",
                "The different meridian points used in the sequence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In this metaphor, the Table Top is the broad, global issue, while the Table Legs are the specific, concrete events or memories that hold that belief in place. Collapsing the legs collapses the table."

            "options": [
                "To ensure the client is speaking loudly enough for the practitioner to hear",
                "To match the verbal intensity of the statement with the client's physiological emotional state",
                "To practice the humming portion of the 9-Gamut sequence",
                "To distract the client from the emotional pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vocal Calibration ensures that the words the client uses accurately reflect the intensity of their internal experience, preventing 'cognitive bypassing' where a client says they feel fine but their voice suggests otherwise."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Karate Chop point, located on the Small Intestine 3 meridian, is traditionally used during the Setup Statement to address subconscious resistance or Psychological Reversal."

                "To test the client's memory and cognitive function",
                "To alternate between right-brain (creative/humming) and left-brain (analytical/counting) activation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Humming activates the right hemisphere (creative/emotional), while counting activates the left hemisphere (linear/logical), facilitating cross-hemispheric integration and neurological alignment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tail-enders are internal objections or 'inner critics' that arise when a client makes a positive statement (e.g., 'I am successful,' followed by the internal tail-ender '...but you're actually a fraud')."

                "To predict the client's future and give them advice",
                "To have the client imagine a future scenario that used to trigger them to see if the shift holds",
                "To schedule the next ten sessions in advance",
                "To speed up the tapping rhythm to finish the session faster"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing is a testing tool where the client mentally rehearses a future situation to ensure the emotional clearing is robust and that they can remain grounded in previously triggering environments."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study (Church et al., 2012) found a 24% decrease in cortisol levels after one hour of EFT, significantly higher than the 14% decrease seen in the talk-therapy control group."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A client's SUDs level drops from an 8 to a 4, but then stops moving despite repeated rounds. According to the T.A.P.P.I.N.G. Method™, what is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "The client is 'tapping resistant' and cannot be helped",
                "The practitioner is tapping too softly",
                "A new 'Aspect' of the problem (a different sensation, memory, or emotion) has emerged",
                "The client has reached their maximum possible healing for one day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When progress stalls, it usually indicates that a new 'Aspect' of the issue has surfaced. The practitioner must identify and target this new specific detail to continue the desensitization process."
