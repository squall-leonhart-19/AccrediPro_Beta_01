            "question": "In the context of the Setup Statement, what is the primary clinical purpose of addressing 'Psychological Reversal' (PR)?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the speed of the tapping sequence",
                "To neutralize subconscious resistance or 'secondary gain' that prevents healing",
                "To ensure the client is physically hydrated before beginning",
                "To replace the need for the Reminder Phrase in subsequent rounds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychological Reversal refers to a subconscious state where the individual is 'stalled' or self-sabotaging. The Setup Statement is specifically designed to neutralize this resistance through self-acceptance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "When comparing the 'Basic Recipe' to the 'Shortened Sequence,' which specific component is typically removed in the Shortened version?",
            "options": [
                "The Karate Chop point",
                "The Setup Statement",
                "The 9-Gamut Procedure",
                "The Reminder Phrase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Shortened Sequence (often called the Clinical EFT sequence) focuses on the meridian points on the face and torso, typically omitting the 9-Gamut Procedure and finger points found in the original Basic Recipe."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "What is the neurological function of the 'Reminder Phrase' during the tapping sequence?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from the pain",
                "To induce a state of light hypnosis",
                "To maintain neural activation of the specific stressor while providing a calming somatic signal",
                "To confirm that the client agrees with the therapist's assessment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Reminder Phrase keeps the 'threat' active in the brain's working memory (neural activation) so that the tapping (de-activating signal) can effectively rewire the amygdala's response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Somatic Mechanics, what is the recommended rhythm and frequency for tapping on each point?",
            "options": [
                "Once every 2 seconds to ensure deep pressure",
                "Approximately 2-3 times per second (similar to a steady heartbeat)",
                "As fast as possible to overwhelm the nervous system",
                "Exactly 21 taps per point regardless of speed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A steady rhythm of 2-3 taps per second is recommended to provide a consistent, resonant signal to the mechanoreceptors without causing irritation or pain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "If a client experiences an abreaction (intense emotional flooding) during a session, which 'Safe Processing' technique involves tapping continuously on one point without words?",
            "options": [
                "The Movie Technique",
                "The Tearless Trauma Technique",
                "The Anchor Point (Continuous Tapping)",
                "The 9-Gamut Roll"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is overwhelmed, 'Continuous Tapping' (usually on the collarbone or side of hand) without verbal processing helps ground the nervous system and regulate the emotional response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A practitioner finds that a client's SUDs score has plateaued at a 6 for three consecutive rounds. What is the most likely 'Troubleshooting' cause?",
            "options": [
                "The client is tapping too softly",
                "A 'Shifting Aspect' has occurred, but the Reminder Phrase has not been updated",
                "The client is too hydrated",
                "The therapist is using the Shortened Sequence instead of the Basic Recipe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stalled progress often occurs because the 'aspect' of the problem has changed (e.g., shifting from anger to guilt), requiring a new Setup Statement and Reminder Phrase to address the new neural pathway."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "During Iterative Processing, if a client's SUDs score drops from a 9 to a 4, how should the Setup Statement be adjusted for the next round?",
            "options": [
                "It should remain exactly the same to maintain consistency",
                "It should be changed to: 'Even though I still have some of this [problem]...'",
                "The Setup Statement should be skipped entirely",
                "It should be changed to a purely positive affirmation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Remaining' or 'Still have some' adjustment acknowledges the progress made while focusing the brain's attention on the residual intensity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "What is the 'Gamut Point' (located on the back of the hand) specifically used for in the 9-Gamut Procedure?",
            "options": [
                "To increase heart rate",
                "To stimulate bilateral brain activity through eye movements and humming/counting",
                "To test the client's physical strength",
                "To end the session regardless of the SUDs score"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 9-Gamut Procedure uses the gamut point in conjunction with eye movements, humming, and counting to engage both hemispheres of the brain and further desensitize the trauma."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "In the 'Anatomy of the Tapping Sequence,' which point is specifically associated with the intersection of the ribs and the mid-axillary line?",
            "options": [
                "Under the Eye (UE)",
                "Under the Arm (UA)",
                "Collarbone (CB)",
                "Top of Head (TH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Under the Arm (UA) point is located on the side of the body, approximately 4 inches below the armpit, corresponding to the Spleen meridian."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a sign that a round of tapping has been successful and a 'Shift' has occurred?",
            "options": [
                "The client begins to argue with the therapist",
                "A spontaneous deep breath, sigh, or yawn from the client",
                "The client's SUDs score increases from a 5 to a 10",
                "The client forgets the Reminder Phrase entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological markers like deep sighing, yawning, or a visible relaxation of the shoulders are classic indicators of the nervous system shifting from sympathetic (fight/flight) to parasympathetic (rest/digest) dominance."
