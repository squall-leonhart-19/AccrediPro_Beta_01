            "question": "Which of the following is the primary indicator that a client has entered 'Cognitive Overdrive' during a T.A.P.P.I.N.G. session?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in emotional intensity (abreaction)",
                "Describing the event using intellectualized 'why' statements rather than sensory 'how' details",
                "A rapid drop in SUDs from a 9 to a 2 in one round",
                "The client reporting a physical tingling sensation in their hands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Overdrive occurs when a client stays in their 'analytical mind,' using intellectual justifications to avoid the actual somatic or emotional experience of the trauma."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "When working with a skeptical client who finds the standard Setup Statement too 'unrealistic,' which linguistic adjustment is recommended in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "Insisting they use the standard phrasing to overcome resistance",
                "Removing the 'Acceptance' portion of the statement entirely",
                "Using 'bridge' language like 'I am open to the possibility of accepting myself'",
                "Replacing the statement with a positive affirmation about future success"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bridge language (e.g., 'I am open to the possibility') reduces the 'tail-enders' or internal objections that skeptical clients feel when the standard setup feels too far from their current reality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "During a high-intensity abreaction, what is the 'Safety First' protocol for a Level 1 practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Stop all tapping immediately and wait for the client to calm down",
                "Ask the client to describe the trauma in more detail to 'vent' it",
                "Switch to continuous tapping (often on the finger points) and maintain a calm, grounding presence",
                "Immediately end the session and refer them to a psychiatrist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Continuous tapping (without talking) helps regulate the nervous system during an abreaction, acting as a 'ballast' to help the client process the intensity safely."

            "question": "Which of the following best defines 'Secondary Gain' as taught in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "The additional weight loss a client might experience after tapping for stress",
                "The unconscious benefit or 'safety' a client perceives in maintaining their current problem",
                "The financial benefit a practitioner gains from long-term clients",
                "The second round of tapping performed on a single aspect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary Gain is a form of resistance where the subconscious fears the consequences of getting better (e.g., losing attention, having to find a job, or losing a 'shield')."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When 'Chasing the Pain' (Lesson 5), what should a practitioner do if a physical sensation moves from the chest to the throat?",
            "options": [
                "Continue tapping on the chest until the sensation there is completely gone",
                "Stop the session, as moving pain indicates the client is not focused",
                "Immediately shift the verbal focus of the tapping to the new sensation in the throat",
                "Tell the client to ignore the throat and focus back on the original chest sensation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In 'Chasing the Pain,' the practitioner follows the energy. If the sensation moves or changes, the tapping focus must shift immediately to match the client's current somatic experience."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Pivot' technique (Lesson 6), when is it most appropriate to introduce a cognitive reframe or positive perspective?",

                "At the very beginning of the session to set a positive tone",
                "When the SUDs level has dropped to a 4 or lower",
                "Only when the SUDs level is at a 10 to provide immediate relief",
                "After the session is over as 'homework'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing too early (when SUDs are high) often results in 'cognitive dissonance' or rejection. The 'Pivot' is most effective once the emotional intensity has been significantly neutralized."

                "Avoiding tapping on the day of the event to keep the adrenaline high"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tapping through a 'Mental Movie' of the upcoming event allows the practitioner to identify and neutralize specific 'micro-stressors' (e.g., the walk to the podium, the first sentence)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A client's SUDs score remains stuck at a 7 despite three rounds of tapping. This 'plateau' is most likely caused by:",
            "options": [
                "The client being 'immune' to EFT",
                "The practitioner tapping too fast",
                "An unaddressed 'Aspect' or a hidden Secondary Gain",
                "The client drinking too much water before the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When SUDs don't budge, it usually means the practitioner is tapping on the 'wrong' thing, or there is a hidden aspect (a different part of the memory) or secondary gain blocking progress."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "What is the recommended 'Minimum Effective Dose' for a sustainable daily practice according to Module 11?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency is superior to intensity for nervous system regulation. 5-10 minutes of daily practice helps maintain a lower baseline of cortisol and emotional reactivity."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 5-4-3-2-1 method (identifying things you see, hear, feel, etc.) combined with tapping is a powerful way to bring a client out of a 'trauma state' and back into the present moment."
