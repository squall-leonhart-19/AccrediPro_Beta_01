            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Precision of Targeting' emphasizes moving from global statements to specific triggers. Which of the following is considered a 'High-Precision' target?",
            "options": [
                "I feel anxious about my job in general.",
                "The specific look of disapproval on my boss's face during Tuesday's 10 AM meeting.",
                "My childhood was very difficult and I felt unloved.",
                "I have a fear of public speaking that affects my career."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-precision targeting requires a specific event, a specific time, and a sensory-based 'snapshot' (the look on the boss's face) to effectively engage the amygdala's fear response."

        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "When navigating SUDs (Subjective Units of Distress), a client's score suddenly jumps from a 4 to an 8. According to Calibration Mastery (L2), what is the most likely clinical explanation?",
            "options": [
                "The tapping is not working for this client.",
                "The client is experiencing a 'Tail-ender' regarding the setup statement.",
                "A new 'aspect' or more intense sub-memory has surfaced and requires focus.",
                "The client is being resistant to the process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A sudden spike in SUDs usually indicates that the tapping has 'peeled back a layer,' revealing a more significant or intense aspect of the memory that was previously suppressed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to the neurobiological research cited in Lesson 3, what is the primary effect of stimulating meridian points while recalling a stressful memory?",
            "options": [
                "It increases cortisol to help the body 'fight' the memory.",
                "It sends a calming signal to the amygdala, deactivating the fight-or-flight response.",
                "It shuts down the prefrontal cortex to prevent overthinking.",
                "It creates a placebo effect that convinces the client they are safe."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tapping provides a 'sensory input' that contradicts the 'emotional output' of the amygdala, leading to the rapid de-escalation of the limbric system's stress response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "In the 'Pivot Point' (L4), at what SUDs level is it generally considered safe and effective to introduce cognitive reframing or 'positive' rounds?",
            "options": [
                "SUDs of 8 or higher",
                "SUDs of 5 or 6",
                "SUDs of 3 or lower",
                "SUDs must be exactly 0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Introducing a reframe too early (high SUDs) often leads to resistance. Once the charge is at a 3 or lower, the 'cognitive window' opens, allowing the client to accept new perspectives."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "During Lesson 5 (Neurological Integration), the therapist asks the client to 'vividly try to get the feeling back.' What is the purpose of this technique?",
            "options": [
                "To see if the client is lying about their SUDs score.",
                "To re-traumatize the client for deeper processing.",
                "To test the 'permanence' of the shift and ensure no hidden aspects remain.",
                "To increase the session time to meet clinical requirements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurological integration is verified when a client attempts to trigger the old emotional response but finds they can no longer access the distress, confirming the neural pathway has been rewired."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A client says, 'I am ready to be successful,' but then whispers, 'But I don't think I'm smart enough.' In Lesson 6, this 'but' is defined as:",
            "options": [
                "A Tail-ender",
                "A Cognitive Pivot",
                "A Physiological Anchor",
                "A Sensory Trigger"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Tail-enders are the internal objections or limiting beliefs that follow a positive statement, representing the 'Psychological Reversal' or resistance that needs to be tapped on."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Which Physiological Grounding technique (L7) is specifically recommended for 'anchoring' the session's progress into the physical body?",
            "options": [
                "Deep diaphragmatic breathing combined with the 'Sore Spot' rub.",
                "Drinking a large glass of water immediately.",
                "The 5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness technique.",
                "Intense aerobic exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Breathwork combined with physical meridian contact (like the Sore Spot or Collarbone point) helps transition the client from 'processing mode' back to 'present-moment awareness.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the T.A.P.P.I.N.G. Method™ (L8), what does the 'N' stand for in the clinical sequence?",
            "options": [
                "Neurological Assessment",
                "Neutralizing Resistance",
                "Negative Emotion Clearing",
                "Normalizing the Experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neutralizing Resistance is the step where we look for Tail-enders and secondary gains to ensure the emotional clearing is complete and lasting."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A 2019 study (Bach et al.) mentioned in the module found that clinical EFT resulted in a significant reduction in resting cortisol levels. What was the approximate percentage reduction compared to the control group?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "24%",
                "37%",
                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research showed a 37% reduction in cortisol levels after one hour of EFT, significantly higher than the 14% reduction found in the talk-therapy control group."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "If a client is unable to identify a specific memory but feels a 'tightness in the chest,' how should the therapist proceed according to the T.A.P.P.I.N.G. Method™?",
            "options": [
                "Refuse to tap until they remember a specific childhood event.",
                "Tap directly on the physical sensation ('This tightness in my chest') as the entry point.",
                "Assume the client is not a good candidate for EFT.",
                "Skip to the 'Pivot Point' and use positive affirmations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a specific event is not immediately accessible, the 'Body-First' approach uses the physical sensation as the target, which often leads the brain to the associated memory during the processing phase."
