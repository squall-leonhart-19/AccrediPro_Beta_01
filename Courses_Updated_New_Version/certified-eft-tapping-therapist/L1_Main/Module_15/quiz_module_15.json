            "question": "In Lesson 1 (Precision Targeting), why is it considered a 'Global Trap' to tap on a general statement like 'I have low self-esteem'?",
            "options": [
                "It is too emotionally intense for the client to handle in one session.",
                "It lacks the specific sensory 'hooks' needed to neutralize the neural pathways associated with the trauma.",
                "Global statements are only used for the Karate Chop point, never the main sequence.",
                "Tapping on global issues causes immediate abreactions in 42% of clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Global statements lack specificity, making it difficult for the brain to target the exact energetic disruption. Breaking a global issue into specific events (The 'Table Leg' metaphor) is essential for permanent clearing."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, when using the 'Validity of Cognition' (VOC) scale to assess a positive reframe, what does a score of '7' indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client feels the positive statement is completely false.",
                "The client feels the statement is moderately true but has some doubt.",
                "The client feels the statement is 100% true and believes it completely.",
                "The client is experiencing a psychological reversal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike the SUDs scale (0-10 for intensity), the VOC scale measures how true a positive belief feels. A 7 indicates the client fully accepts the new cognition as true."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Psychological Reversal' (PR). Which of the following is the most common clinical indicator that a client is experiencing PR?",
            "options": [
                "The SUDs level stays the same or increases despite several rounds of tapping.",
                "The client begins to cry uncontrollably during the tapping sequence.",
                "The client reports feeling a tingling sensation in their fingertips.",
                "The SUDs level drops from a 10 to a 2 in a single round."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Psychological Reversal is a form of subconscious resistance where the system blocks progress. Stagnant or rising SUDs levels are classic indicators that the PR must be addressed via the Setup Statement."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (The Art of the Pivot), what is the recommended SUDs threshold before introducing a cognitive reframe?",
            "options": [
                "SUDs should be at a 10 to maximize the contrast.",
                "SUDs should be between 7 and 8.",
                "SUDs should be at a 5 to test the client's resilience.",
                "SUDs should typically be a 3 or lower."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Introducing a reframe too early (when SUDs are high) can feel like 'toxic positivity' or gaslighting to the client. We wait until the emotional charge is neutralized (usually 3 or below) before pivoting to a new perspective."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 describes 'Chasing the Pain' in Somatic Neutralization. What should a therapist do if a client's tension moves from their chest to their throat during tapping?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the throat and continue tapping on the chest until it is a 0.",
                "Immediately stop the session as this indicates a severe abreaction.",
                "Pivot the tapping focus to the new sensation in the throat.",
                "Tell the client to focus on a happy memory to distract from the pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In EFT, energy often shifts. If a sensation moves or changes quality, the therapist must 'chase' it by updating the Setup Statement to reflect the current somatic experience."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Per Lesson 7, which technique is most appropriate to use if a client enters a 'flooding' state or abreaction?",

                "The 'Floor and Ceiling' technique (rapidly tapping while moving eyes from floor to ceiling).",
                "Increasing the speed and pressure of the tapping on the collarbone point.",
                "Asking the client to describe the trauma in more vivid detail."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Floor and Ceiling' technique is a grounding tool used to break the loop of an abreaction and bring the client back into the room and their body safely."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The T.A.P.P.I.N.G. acronym stands for Target, Assessment, Physical Sensations, Phrases, Intensity, Nuances, and Grounding/Growth."

            "options": [
                "Tapping only when a major crisis occurs.",

                "Reading a book about tapping while sitting in a quiet room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking involves attaching a new habit (tapping) to an existing one (brewing coffee). This ensures the practice is integrated into daily life rather than being a chore."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A client resists clearing a 'grief' issue because they feel that letting go of the pain means letting go of the person they lost. Lesson 3 identifies this as:",
            "options": [
                "A lack of imagination.",
                "A neurological deficit.",
                "Secondary Gain (The subconscious benefit of keeping the problem).",
                "Abreaction potential."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Secondary Gain occurs when the subconscious perceives the problem (the pain of grief) as having a protective or meaningful function (staying connected to the deceased)."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "When using the 'Movie Technique' (Lesson 1), what is the primary goal of having the client 'freeze-frame' a specific moment?",
            "options": [
                "To make the session last longer.",
                "To isolate a specific peak of intensity (a 'nuance') to tap on it individually.",
                "To test if the client is actually paying attention.",
                "To stop the client from becoming too relaxed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Freeze-framing allows the therapist and client to identify the exact 'crescendo' of the emotional event, ensuring that every specific aspect of the memory is neutralized."
