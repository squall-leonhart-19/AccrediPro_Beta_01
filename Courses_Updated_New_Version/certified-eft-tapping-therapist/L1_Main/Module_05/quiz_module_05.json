            "question": "In the context of the 'Integrate' phase, what does the term 'Tail-Ender' specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The final tapping point used in a sequence (the Karate Chop point)",
                "The subconscious 'Yes, but...' objection that follows a positive affirmation",
                "The physical sensation of relief felt at the end of a session",
                "The residual SUDs score that remains after the first round of tapping"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tail-enders are the internal objections or 'inner critics' that surface immediately after a positive statement, revealing remaining cognitive dissonance or limiting beliefs."

            "question": "Which physiological marker is the most reliable indicator that a client has achieved a 'Parasympathetic Shift' during Vagal Toning?",
            "options": [
                "Increased heart rate and rapid breathing",
                "Dilation of the pupils and increased muscle tension",
                "Spontaneous yawning, deep sighing, or stomach gurgling",
                "A sudden increase in cognitive analytical thinking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spontaneous yawning, sighing, and digestive sounds (borborygmus) are classic signs that the Vagus nerve has been stimulated and the body is shifting from sympathetic (fight/flight) to parasympathetic (rest/digest) dominance."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Vivid Imagery Test' (L8) is used to verify integration by asking the client to:",
            "options": [
                "Imagine a future where they never experience stress again",
                "Visualize the original traumatic event in as much detail as possible to see if it triggers a response",
                "Recall only the positive aspects of their childhood",
                "Mentally repeat the tapping sequence without physically moving"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vivid Imagery Test is a 'stress test' for the work done. If the client can visualize the previously distressing event vividly without a rise in SUDs, the integration is considered successful and stable."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "According to the Science of Integration (L1), what is the primary neurological goal of the 'I' phase in the EFT process?",
            "options": [
                "To completely erase the memory of the event from the hippocampus",
                "To move the memory from a 'labile' state to a stable, consolidated state through neuroplasticity",
                "To suppress the prefrontal cortex so the amygdala can rest",
                "To increase cortisol production to help the client 'face their fears'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration aims to consolidate the new, neutral emotional response into long-term memory, effectively 'rewiring' the neural pathway so the memory no longer triggers a stress response."

            "id": "q5_5",

                "Vagal Toning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic-Cognitive Coherence occurs when the mind's thoughts (the cognitive) and the body's sensations (the somatic) are in alignment. Physical constriction suggests the body does not yet 'believe' the confident statement."

            "question": "During Lesson 4, the 9-Gamut Procedure is highlighted as a tool for Neurological Consolidation. Which specific action is a key part of this procedure?",
            "options": [
                "Tapping on the top of the head while counting to ten",
                "Specific eye movements combined with humming and counting",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 9-Gamut Procedure involves eye movements, humming, and counting, which are designed to engage both brain hemispheres and facilitate neurological consolidation of the work."

            "question": "When using Advanced Installation Phrasing (L7), why is the 'I choose to...' format often superior to simple affirmations?",
            "options": [
                "It is shorter and easier for the client to remember",
                "It bypasses the 'Tail-Ender' by acknowledging the client's agency and autonomy",
                "It forces the brain to produce more dopamine immediately",
                "It is a requirement of the AccrediPro Standards Institute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'I choose' statements empower the client and are less likely to trigger the subconscious 'rejection' that standard affirmations (like 'I am rich') might cause if they feel untrue."

            "options": [
                "Testing the client's SUDs once at the beginning and once at the end",
                "Systematically checking for remaining 'aspects' or 'shrapnel' of the issue after the main intensity has dropped",
                "Repeating the same tapping script for 21 days",
                "Using a muscle testing kit to verify the results"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iterative testing involves looking for 'side issues' or different angles (aspects) of the problem to ensure the emotional relief is comprehensive and won't be easily triggered by a slightly different context."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study on Vagal Toning mentioned in the course found that tapping on the face and hands specifically stimulates which branch of the Vagus nerve?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal branch (associated with 'freeze')",
                "The Ventral Vagal branch (associated with social engagement and safety)",
                "The Sciatic nerve branch",
                "The Sympathetic Chain Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulating the tapping points helps activate the Ventral Vagal complex, which promotes a sense of safety, social connection, and emotional regulation."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "If a client passes the Vivid Imagery Test but then encounters the real-life trigger and feels a SUDs of 3, what is the therapist's next step according to the Integration Loop?",
            "options": [
                "The session was a failure; start over from Module 1",
                "Tell the client to ignore it as it's just 'phantom' pain",
                "Treat the SUDs of 3 as a 'new aspect' and return to the tapping process to resolve the remaining trigger",
                "Immediately switch to a different modality like Hypnosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Integration Loop, any remaining intensity (even a 3) is simply information that another aspect or 'tail-ender' needs to be addressed and cleared."
