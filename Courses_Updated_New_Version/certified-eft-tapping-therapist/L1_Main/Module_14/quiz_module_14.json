            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Table Top' analogy is used to describe the relationship between global issues and specific events. What do the 'Table Legs' represent?",
            "options": [
                "The client's current emotional state (SUDs)",
                "Specific, sensory-based past events that support the global belief",
                "The various tapping points on the upper body",
                "The practitioner's rapport-building techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In EFT, the 'Table Top' is the global issue (e.g., 'I'm not good enough'), while the 'Table Legs' are the specific memories or events that support that belief. Collapsing the legs collapses the table."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client is tapping on a fear of public speaking. After three rounds, the SUDs score remains stuck at an 8. According to Lesson 2, what is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "The client is not tapping hard enough on the points",
                "The practitioner is using the wrong tapping sequence",
                "Psychological Reversal or a secondary gain is blocking progress",
                "The client has reached the Apex Effect early"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When SUDs scores do not budge despite accurate tapping, it usually indicates Psychological Reversal (PR) or a secondary gain where part of the subconscious feels it is unsafe to let go of the problem."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "When a client presents with a trauma and a SUDs level of 10+, Lesson 3 recommends which 'distancing' technique to ensure safety?",
            "options": [
                "The Movie Technique",

                "The Rapid Reframing Protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Tearless Trauma Technique (or 'Sneaking Up' on the trauma) allows the practitioner to test the emotional charge by tapping on the *guess* of the emotion before the client even looks at the memory, ensuring safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4's 'Pivot Phase,' why is it critical to wait until the SUDs score is below a 3 before introducing positive reframes?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the 'Apex Effect' from occurring too early",
                "Because the client will run out of energy if they tap for too long",
                "To avoid 'tail-enders' or cognitive dissonance where the mind rejects the positive statement",
                "Positive reframes only work when the client is in a theta brainwave state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If you introduce a positive reframe while the negative charge is still high, the client's subconscious will often generate 'tail-enders' (yes, but...) which invalidates the reframe."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "During a session, a client reports that the 'tightness in their chest' has disappeared but now they feel a 'sharp pain in their shoulder.' According to Lesson 5, this is an example of:",

                "Psychological Reversal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shifting Aspects occur when the emotional or physical manifestation of the issue changes form or location as the original layer is neutralized."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "A client successfully clears a lifelong phobia in one session but then claims, 'I think I just grew out of it today' or 'It wasn't that bad to begin with.' What phenomenon from Lesson 6 does this describe?",

                "Cognitive Dissonance",
                "The Apex Effect",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Apex Effect is a cognitive quirk where a client dismisses the effectiveness of EFT and attributes their sudden relief to external factors or claims the problem was never serious."

            "id": "q14_7",

                "Using the 'Movie Technique' on every client's trauma after the session ends"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Personal Peace Procedure involves creating a comprehensive list of every specific negative event in one's life and systematically tapping them down to zero to ensure practitioner longevity and clarity."

                "Test the results by having the client try to 'bring back' the negative feeling",

                "End the session to allow the nervous system to rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration involves testing the work. By asking the client to try and 'vividly imagine' the problem or 'try to get the feeling back,' the practitioner ensures the neutralization is robust."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "When using the 'Movie Technique' (Lesson 3), what is the correct action to take if the client feels a 'zap' of intensity while narrating the story?",

                "Tell them to keep talking to push through the fear",

                "Ask the client to open their eyes and perform the 9-Gamut sequence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Movie Technique requires the client to stop as soon as they feel any intensity. That specific moment becomes a new 'aspect' to be tapped on until the client can watch that part of the movie peacefully."

                "5-10%",
                "12-15%",

                "50-65%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those by Dr. Peta Stapleton, have shown that EFT can reduce cortisol levels by significantly more than talk therapy, often in the 24-37% range after a single hour."
