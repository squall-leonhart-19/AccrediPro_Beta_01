            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "During a professional L1 session, a practitioner notices the client is 'drifting' from the specific event to general complaints. What is the most effective way to maintain the session's 'Anatomy'?",
            "options": [
                "Allow the client to vent to build rapport",
                "Gently interrupt and use the 'Movie Technique' to refocus on one specific scene",
                "Increase the tapping speed to bypass the conscious mind",
                "Stop the session and restart the intake process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining the 'Anatomy' of a session requires specificity. The Movie Technique helps pin down a specific event when a client becomes global or 'drifts'."

            "question": "According to the 'Ethical Boundaries and Scope of Practice' lesson, which scenario requires an immediate referral to a licensed mental health professional?",
            "options": [
                "A client wanting to improve their public speaking confidence",
                "A client reporting a SUDs level of 10 regarding a recent breakup",
                "A client disclosing active self-harm impulses or clinical psychosis",
                "A client who is skeptical about the effectiveness of tapping"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must operate within their scope. Clinical issues like active self-harm or psychosis are outside the scope of an EFT Coach/Therapist and require referral to specialized clinical care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A client experiences a dramatic shift from a SUDs 9 to a 2, but then claims, 'I think it just went away on its own because I'm tired.' What is this phenomenon called?",
            "options": [
                "The Placebo Shift",
                "The Apex Effect",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Apex Effect occurs when a client experiences a significant result but attributes it to anything other than the tapping (e.g., 'I just realized it wasn't a big deal' or 'Time healed it')."

            "id": "q10_4",

            "options": [
                "The client's diet and hydration",
                "Psychological Reversal or 'Tail-enders' (internal objections)",
                "The room temperature and environment",
                "The client's childhood relationship with their father"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stalled sessions are often caused by 'Tail-enders'—the 'yes, but' thoughts that indicate Psychological Reversal or secondary gain from keeping the problem."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "In the context of Public Speaking anxiety (Lesson 4), why is it recommended to tap on the 'Future Pace' of the event?",
            "options": [
                "To predict exactly what will happen during the speech",
                "To clear the 'anticipatory anxiety' and physiological triggers before the event occurs",
                "Because tapping only works on future events, not past ones",
                "To memorize the speech more effectively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing allows the client to identify and clear triggers that haven't happened yet, reducing the 'anticipatory anxiety' that often leads to a sympathetic nervous system hijack."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Gary Craig’s 'Personal Peace Procedure' (PPP) suggests that practitioners and clients list at least how many specific troublesome events from their life?",

            "options": [
                "Requiring the child to use formal clinical terminology",
                "Using a 'Tapping Bear' or soft toy to demonstrate points (Surrogate/Play)",
                "Insisting the child sits perfectly still for 45 minutes",
                "Focusing exclusively on the child's academic performance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For younger children, using toys like a 'Tapping Bear' makes the process externalized, playful, and less intimidating, which is essential for their developmental stage."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism identified in Lesson 7 regarding 'Borrowing Benefits' during group sessions?",
            "options": [
                "The group leader absorbs the stress of the participants",
                "Participants experience a reduction in their own intensity by tapping along with someone else's issue",
                "It is a form of hypnosis where the group mimics the leader's emotions",
                "The benefits only occur if every person in the group has the exact same problem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Borrowing Benefits is the phenomenon where tapping along with someone else’s process (even if the issue is different) lowers the observer's own emotional intensity and SUDs."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "During the 'Discovery Consultation' (Lesson 8), why is it critical to explain that EFT is not a replacement for medical advice?",
            "options": [
                "To discourage the client from seeing a doctor",
                "To manage expectations and fulfill legal/ethical disclosure requirements",
                "Because EFT only works on 10% of the population",
                "To ensure the practitioner can charge higher fees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clear communication during onboarding regarding the nature of EFT ensures informed consent and protects the practitioner legally by establishing that EFT is a complementary tool, not a medical replacement."

            "question": "A 2019 study on EFT (Bach et al.) showed a 43% decrease in what physiological marker after group tapping, supporting the 'Borrowing Benefits' theory?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose",
                "Cortisol (Stress Hormone)",
                "White Blood Cell count",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The landmark study by Bach et al. (2019) demonstrated a 43% significant decrease in cortisol levels following EFT sessions, providing biological evidence for its stress-reduction capabilities."
