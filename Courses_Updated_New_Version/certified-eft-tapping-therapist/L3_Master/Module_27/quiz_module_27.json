            "options": [
                "Focusing solely on the physical mechanics of the movement",
                "Tapping on the specific 'First Time' or 'Worst Time' the performance failure occurred",
                "Increasing the athlete's adrenaline levels through rapid tapping",
                "Ignoring the past and only focusing on future positive visualizations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In sports psychology, EFT is most effective when it resolves the 'cellular memory' of a previous failure or trauma that is causing the neurological 'misfire' known as the yips."

            "question": "According to research on EFT and autoimmune management, why is addressing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) considered critical?",
            "options": [
                "Because ACEs have no correlation with adult physical health",
                "High ACE scores are statistically linked to chronic inflammation and immune system dysregulation",
                "Autoimmune diseases are purely genetic and cannot be influenced by emotions",
                "Tapping on ACEs is only used for weight loss, not physical pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that high ACE scores correlate with increased inflammatory markers; EFT helps down-regulate the sympathetic nervous system, potentially reducing autoimmune flare-ups."

                "To surprise the client with a tapping point they didn't expect",
                "To tap on the craving without the client being aware of it",
                "To approach a highly intense or traumatic trigger gradually to avoid an overwhelming emotional abreaction",
                "To eliminate the craving in under 30 seconds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Sneaking Up' technique allows the practitioner to address intense cravings or underlying traumas safely by starting with peripheral aspects before moving to the core trigger."

                "Insisting the child follows the standard protocol strictly",
                "Using 'Surrogate Tapping' through the parent or using a 'Tapping Bear' (doll)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For young children, surrogate tapping or using a transitional object like a Tapping Bear makes the process non-threatening and engaging."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical trials have shown that EFT significantly reduces cortisol; lower cortisol levels help stabilize insulin and reduce the biological drive for emotional eating and fat storage."
