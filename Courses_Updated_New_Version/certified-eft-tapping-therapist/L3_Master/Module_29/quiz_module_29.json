            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Targeting,' what is the defining characteristic of a 'Primary Domino' event?",
            "options": [
                "The most recent event where the client felt the negative emotion.",
                "An early, foundational memory that, when neutralized, collapses the emotional charge of subsequent related events.",
                "A future-oriented fear that prevents the client from moving forward.",
                "The event with the highest SUDs (Subjective Units of Distress) score currently being reported."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Primary Domino' is the foundational or 'root' memory. Neutralizing this core event creates a ripple effect, often resolving multiple 'derivative' memories and beliefs simultaneously."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "During Somatic Assessment, if a client exhibits shallow breathing, dilated pupils, and rapid speech, which state of the nervous system are they likely inhabiting?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Collapse)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)",
                "Parasympathetic (Rest/Digest)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shallow breathing, dilated pupils, and rapid speech are classic indicators of Sympathetic nervous system activation, signaling a state of high arousal or 'Fight/Flight.'"

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "When navigating high-intensity catharsis (abreaction), the 'Titration' technique involves which of the following actions?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the speed of tapping to process the emotion faster.",
                "Breaking the traumatic memory into tiny, manageable 'shards' or segments to prevent flooding.",
                "Stopping the tapping immediately and asking the client to open their eyes.",
                "Moving directly to a positive reframe to bypass the intensity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down and breaking the experience into small, digestible pieces, ensuring the client stays within their 'Window of Tolerance' without becoming overwhelmed."

            "options": [
                "To correct the client's grammar and make their statements more 'positive.'",
                "To demonstrate the therapist's superior vocabulary and knowledge.",
                "To build deep subconscious rapport and ensure the reframe resonates with the client's internal map of reality.",
                "To distract the client from the physical sensations in their body."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mirroring the client's exact words ensures that the reframe is accepted by the subconscious mind, as it uses the client's own internal coding and linguistic structure."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "According to the principles of Neural Integration and Memory Reconsolidation, what must occur for a cellular change to be 'locked in'?",
            "options": [
                "The client must repeat the tapping sequence 21 times at home.",
                "The target memory must be reactivated while simultaneously introducing a mismatching experience (the tapping).",
                "The SUDs score must reach exactly 0 within the first 10 minutes.",
                "The client must avoid thinking about the trauma for at least 48 hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Memory Reconsolidation requires the 'mismatch' or 'error' signal. By activating the traumatic memory (arousal) and applying tapping (calming signal), the brain updates the old memory file with new, neutral information."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "A client states, 'I want to be wealthy, but if I have money, my family will constantly ask me for loans.' This is an example of:",

                "The Apex Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This is a classic 'Secondary Gain' or 'Tail-Ender.' It represents a subconscious objection or a perceived 'cost' of getting better/achieving the goal, which acts as a safety mechanism."

            "options": [
                "Hypnotize the client into a deep sleep.",
                "Test the work by having the client vividly imagine a previously triggering situation to see if any intensity remains.",

                "Determine the client's billing schedule for future sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing is a critical 'test.' If the client can imagine the old trigger and remain physiologically calm, it confirms the neural pathways have been successfully updated."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "Research on EFT (e.g., Bach et al., 2019) indicates that successful sessions often result in a significant drop in which physiological marker?",
            "options": [
                "Blood glucose levels",
                "Cortisol (the stress hormone)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that clinical EFT can reduce cortisol levels by significantly more than traditional talk therapy, often ranging from 24% to 43% in a single hour."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "When a client experiences the 'Apex Effect' after a Master Session, how are they likely to react?",
            "options": [
                "They will immediately credit the tapping for their total transformation.",
                "They will experience a massive abreaction and require grounding.",
                "They may minimize the results, claiming they 'just feel better' or that the problem 'wasn't that bad to begin with.'",
                "They will forget their own name for several minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Apex Effect occurs when the change is so profound and integrated that the client's brain 'forgets' how bad the problem was, often attributing the relief to external factors rather than the tapping."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "During the 'Synthesize' phase of the Master Session, what is the practitioner's primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "To introduce as many new tapping points as possible.",
                "To weave together the emotional shifts, cognitive reframes, and somatic releases into a coherent new narrative for the client.",
                "To convince the client to sign up for a 12-month coaching package.",
                "To explain the complex neuroscience of the amygdala in detail."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is about integration—bringing all the 'pieces' of the session together so the client leaves with a unified sense of resolution and a new, empowered perspective."
