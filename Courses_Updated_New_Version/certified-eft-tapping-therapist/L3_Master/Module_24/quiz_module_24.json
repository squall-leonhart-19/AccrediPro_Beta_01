                "Ignoring the client's negative statement to focus only on positive affirmations.",
                "Shifting the focus from the 'problem story' to the underlying positive intent or survival resource.",

                "Using physical movement to distract the client from an emotional trigger."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pivot is a master-level skill that identifies the adaptive quality or positive intent behind a 'negative' behavior or symptom, reframing it as a resource that once served the client."

                "Poor energetic hygiene and a lack of professional boundaries."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Resonance is the ability of the Master Practitioner to use their own body as a 'bio-feedback' instrument to sense what the client may be feeling but not yet expressing verbally."

            "options": [
                "Because the Protector part is usually the strongest part of the personality.",
                "To avoid a 'backlash' or increased resistance/symptoms after the session.",
                "Because EFT only works on parts that are consciously aware of the tapping.",
                "Protector parts are actually the client's higher self and must be obeyed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Parts Work, bypassing a Protector to get to an Exile (wounded part) often results in the Protector 'locking down' the system even harder later, leading to an abreaction or session plateau."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clean Language questions use the client's exact words and avoid introducing the practitioner's metaphors, assumptions, or leading suggestions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A sudden, 'too-fast' drop in SUDs (Subjective Units of Distress) often indicates the client has 'checked out' or dissociated from the feeling rather than processing it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Provocative tapping uses benign humor and paradox to 'jolt' the client out of stuck cognitive loops and rigid 'I can't' stories."

            "options": [
                "Nothing, as EFT practitioners are immune to secondary trauma.",
                "Engage in a 'clearing' ritual or personal tapping to release any resonant energy.",
                "Call the next client immediately to maintain momentum.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Clean Language/Symbolic Modeling, asking about the attributes of a client's own metaphor (like color, shape, or location) helps the client explore their internal landscape more deeply."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The practitioner's presence acts as a 'co-regulator.' Staying calm and continuing to tap helps the client's amygdala realize they are safe in the present moment despite the intensity of the memory."
