            "question": "In the context of 'Borrowing Benefits' (Lesson 2), what is the primary reason participants experience relief even when they aren't the focus of the session?",
            "options": [
                "The placebo effect of being in a social environment",
                "Vicarious reinforcement and the activation of mirror neurons while tapping along",
                "The facilitator's energy field expanding to cover the room",
                "The suppression of personal issues in favor of the group's needs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Borrowing Benefits works through vicarious reinforcement and mirror neuron activation; as participants tap along with another person's issue, their own nervous system processes similar emotional charges."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When adapting EFT for the Corporate World (Lesson 5), which linguistic shift is most recommended to ensure professional buy-in?",
            "options": [
                "Replacing 'Trauma' with 'High-Stakes Stress Triggers'",
                "Using 'Energy Merdians' instead of 'Neural Pathways'",
                "Replacing 'Psychological Reversal' with 'Spiritual Blockage'",
                "Insisting on the term 'Tapping' rather than 'Stress Management Technique'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Corporate environments respond better to clinical or performance-based language. Terms like 'High-Stakes Stress Triggers' or 'Neural Regulation' are more accessible than 'Trauma' in a business setting."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Advanced Facilitation, what is the 'Golden Rule' when a participant has an intense abreaction (emotional flood) in a group setting?",
            "options": [
                "Stop the group immediately and call for medical assistance",
                "Ignore the participant to avoid giving the behavior 'attention'",
                "Keep the group tapping together while providing the individual with a grounding anchor",
                "Ask the individual to leave the room until they have calmed down"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maintain the 'Safety Container,' the facilitator should keep the group tapping (which supports the individual through Borrowing Benefits) while focusing specific grounding attention on the person in distress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, when using the T.A.P.P.I.N.G. Method™ for large audiences (100+ people), how should the 'T' (Targeting) phase be modified?",
            "options": [
                "The facilitator should pick one person's highly specific trauma to work on",
                "Participants should be told to think of their 'worst life memory' simultaneously",
                "The facilitator should use 'Universal Global Themes' like 'The Stress of Modern Life'",
                "The Targeting phase should be skipped entirely to ensure safety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In very large groups, specificity can be dangerous. Facilitators should use 'Global Themes' or 'Universal Metaphors' to ensure everyone can relate without diving too deep into private traumas without individual support."

        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "Lesson 6 highlights 'Digital Facilitation.' What is a critical technical requirement for maintaining safety in an online EFT workshop?",

                "Disabling the 'Chat' function so participants don't get distracted"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety in digital EFT requires the facilitator to monitor participants for signs of dissociation or abreaction. Seeing faces and hands in Gallery View is essential for this visual assessment."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 8 (Ethics & Liability), which statement must be included in a Group EFT Waiver that is not typically required in individual sessions?",
            "options": [

                "A requirement that participants must have a medical degree to attend"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In groups, the facilitator cannot guarantee privacy from other participants. Therefore, a 'Mutual Confidentiality' or 'Vegas Rule' agreement is ethically and legally mandatory."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first week of a multi-week program must focus on building rapport, establishing the safety container, and ensuring every participant can self-regulate using basic tapping before moving to deeper work."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "A 2013 study (Church et al.) mentioned in Lesson 2 found that 'Borrowing Benefits' resulted in significant reductions in which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Only physical pain scores",
                "Only psychological distress in the person on stage",

                "Financial anxiety but not physical symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The research showed that participants tapping along (Borrowing Benefits) experienced significant drops in both psychological distress and physical pain, mirroring the results of the 'proband' (the person working with the facilitator)."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 1's 'Architecture of Group EFT,' what is 'The Circle of Safety'?",
            "options": [
                "A physical circle where people must hold hands while tapping",
                "A metaphorical and structural framework that defines the boundaries and expectations of the group",
                "A specific tapping sequence used only for protection",
                "A legal document that prevents participants from suing the facilitator"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Circle of Safety refers to the structural framework—including ground rules, confidentiality, and facilitator presence—that makes the group environment safe for emotional processing."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "When facilitating for a corporate client (Lesson 5), how should 'Resistance' from skeptical employees be handled?",
            "options": [
                "By telling them they aren't ready for 'The Work'",
                "By using 'The Skeptic's Tap'—validating their doubt as the first tapping target",
                "By ignoring the skeptics and only focusing on the believers",
                "By presenting more spiritual evidence of energy meridians"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In corporate settings, 'The Skeptic's Tap' (tapping on the feeling of 'this won't work' or 'this is weird') is a powerful way to build rapport and lower the nervous system's resistance to the modality."
