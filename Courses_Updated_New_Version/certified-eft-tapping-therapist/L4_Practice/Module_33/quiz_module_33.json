            "question": "An EFT practitioner who is not a licensed mental health professional (LMHP) is asked by a client to help 'cure' their clinically diagnosed Bipolar Disorder. What is the legally compliant response?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with tapping as long as the client signs a waiver.",
                "State that EFT can cure any disorder by clearing the energy system.",
                "Clarify that EFT is a stress-reduction tool and the client must remain under the care of their psychiatrist.",
                "Suggest the client stop their medication so EFT can work more effectively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must stay within their scope of practice. Non-licensed practitioners cannot treat or claim to cure clinical mental health disorders and must ensure clients maintain their primary medical/psychiatric care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because EFT involves physical touch (or self-touch) and can surface intense emotional 'abreactions,' these specific risks and the nature of the technique must be disclosed for consent to be 'informed.'"

                "Yes, because the incident happened while the policy was active.",
                "Yes, because professional liability insurance is lifetime coverage.",
                "No, unless the practitioner purchased an 'Extended Reporting Period' or 'Tail' coverage.",
                "No, because liability insurance only covers physical injuries, not emotional ones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Claims-made policies only cover claims filed while the policy is active. To cover claims filed after the policy ends (for events that happened during the policy), 'Tail' coverage is required."
