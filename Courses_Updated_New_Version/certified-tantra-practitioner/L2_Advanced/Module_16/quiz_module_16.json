            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the SACRED Path, 'R' stands for Radical Responsibility, which emphasizes that the client must take full ownership of their energetic state and healing process for lasting transformation."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2's case study on somatic trauma, a client experiences 'neurogenic tremors' during a session. According to the lesson, what does this physiological response indicate?",

                "A lack of proper hydration before the somatic work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurogenic tremors are a natural nervous system response indicating the discharge of stored trauma and the completion of a biological stress cycle, often centered in the psoas."

            "id": "q16_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polarity requires a magnetic difference; when both partners drift into the same pole (often through the 'roommate syndrome'), the sexual and energetic attraction neutralizes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
