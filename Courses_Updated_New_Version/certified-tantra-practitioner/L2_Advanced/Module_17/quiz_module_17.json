            "question": "A client suddenly begins shaking, their breathing becomes shallow, and they stop responding to verbal cues during a somatic session. According to Lesson 1, what is the most appropriate first step?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the touch to provide a 'corrective emotional experience'.",
                "Immediately cease all touch and use 'orienting' cues to bring them back to the room.",
                "Ask the client to dive deeper into the memory to process the trauma.",
                "Cover the client with a blanket and leave the room to give them space."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the event of an acute trauma trigger or somatic flashback, the priority is safety and regulation. Ceasing touch and using orienting (grounding) techniques helps the client return to their Window of Tolerance."

                "Increased sensitivity to light and sound."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dissociation often manifests physically as a 'checking out' look (glassy eyes), fixed gaze, or a sudden limpness in the body as the client disconnects from the physical sensation."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client expresses that they are 'falling in love' with you and believes you are the only person who truly understands them. This is a classic example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 0,

                "The practitioner should focus on 'fixing' the client's physical impairment.",
                "Disability is caused by the way society is organized, rather than by a person’s impairment.",
                "The client should be treated the same as an able-bodied client to avoid discrimination.",
                "Somatic work is ineffective for those with permanent physical limitations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Social Model of Disability posits that systemic barriers and social exclusion are the primary 'disabling' factors, encouraging practitioners to adapt the environment and session flow to the client's needs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must remain neutral to avoid triangulation, which occurs when one person tries to pull the practitioner into a 'two-against-one' dynamic."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Boundary repair begins with the practitioner's immediate acknowledgement of the mistake and taking full responsibility, which validates the client's experience and restores safety."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active suicidal ideation is outside the scope of a Tantra Practitioner and requires immediate clinical intervention and referral to qualified emergency or mental health services."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shifting the focus from a specific sexual outcome (like erection or orgasm) to the pure enjoyment of sensation is the hallmark of successful somatic interventions for performance anxiety."
