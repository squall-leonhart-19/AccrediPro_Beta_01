            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1, which of the following best describes a 'Dual Relationship' that a Tantra practitioner should avoid?",
            "options": [
                "Using both breathwork and touch in a single session",
                "Entering into a business partnership or social friendship with a current client",
                "Working with a client who has seen multiple other practitioners",
                "Practicing Tantra while also maintaining a personal meditation practice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A dual relationship occurs when a practitioner interacts with a client in more than one capacity (e.g., social, financial, or romantic), which can cloud professional judgment and create power imbalances."

        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "The 'R' in the S.A.C.R.E.D. Consent Framework stands for 'Revocable.' What does this specifically imply for a Tantric session?",
            "options": [
                "Consent must be renewed every 12 months",
                "The practitioner can revoke their services if the client is late",
                "Consent can be withdrawn at any moment, for any reason, without penalty",
                "The client cannot change their mind once the ritual has begun"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Revocable consent means the client has the absolute right to stop any practice at any time, even if they previously agreed to it, ensuring their autonomy is respected throughout the experience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the primary danger of the 'Practitioner’s Shadow' in a high-intimacy setting?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner might forget the sequence of the ritual",
                "The practitioner may unconsciously use the client to meet their own needs for validation or power",
                "The practitioner might become too relaxed during the session",
                "The practitioner may charge too little for their services"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Shadow' represents the unintegrated parts of the practitioner. In Tantra, this often manifests as seeking ego-validation or emotional fulfillment through the client, which violates ethical boundaries."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A client begins to project feelings of intense romantic love onto the practitioner. Based on Lesson 4, this is an example of:",

                "Erotic Transference",
                "Spiritual Awakening",
                "Somatic Release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Erotic Transference occurs when a client redirects sexual or romantic desires onto the practitioner, often as a result of the deep intimacy and safety provided in the container."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "In trauma-informed ethics (Lesson 5), what is the 'Window of Tolerance'?",
            "options": [
                "The amount of time a client can wait for an appointment",
                "The physical distance a practitioner must keep from a client",
                "The zone of arousal where a person can process information and emotions effectively",
                "The legal limit for session duration in somatic therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal zone of nervous system arousal. If a client goes above (hyper-arousal) or below (hypo-arousal) this zone, they cannot process the work and may be re-traumatized."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Ethical Marketing.' Which of the following claims would be considered a violation of financial integrity?",

                "'Tantra can help increase your awareness of bodily sensations.'",
                "'My 3-day workshop is guaranteed to cure your clinical depression and PTSD.'",
                "'I offer a sliding scale for those with financial hardships.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing prohibits making 'guaranteed' medical or psychological claims. Promising to 'cure' clinical conditions like PTSD is both unethical and legally dangerous."

            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "Regarding 'Scope of Practice' in Lesson 7, if a client reveals they are having active suicidal ideations, the Tantra practitioner should:",
            "options": [
                "Perform a heart-opening ritual immediately",
                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional or emergency services",

                "Ask the client to meditate on the feeling until it passes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Suicidal ideation is outside the scope of practice for a Tantra Practitioner. Ethical accountability requires immediate referral to qualified clinical professionals."

            "question": "What is the 'Golden Rule' of personal integrity for practitioners mentioned in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "Never charge more than $200 per hour",
                "Practice what you preach; maintain your own daily 'Sadhana' and self-regulation",
                "Always wear white during sessions",
                "Only work with clients who have previous experience in yoga"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Personal integrity (Devotion) requires the practitioner to engage in their own self-care and spiritual practice to remain a clear, regulated channel for the client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A practitioner feels a strong sexual attraction to a client and starts to adjust the session to include more physical touch than originally agreed upon. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Positive Transference",
                "Unmanaged Counter-transference",
                "Advanced Tantric Technique",
                "Intuitive Healing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counter-transference occurs when the practitioner projects their own feelings onto the client. Acting on these feelings by changing the session structure is a serious ethical boundary violation."

            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "Which document is essential for legal protection and ensuring informed consent before the first session begins?",
            "options": [
                "A liability waiver and professional disclosure statement",
                "A copy of the practitioner's lineage certificate",
                "A list of the practitioner's personal social media handles",
                "A dietary recommendation guide"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A liability waiver and disclosure statement clearly outline the nature of the work, the risks involved, and the professional boundaries, providing a legal and ethical foundation for the container."
