            "options": ["The Ida and Pingala nadis", "The Ren (Conception) and Du (Governing) vessels", "The Shushumna and the Vagus nerve", "The Solar and Lunar plexuses"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Microcosmic Orbit involves circulating energy up the Du (Governing) vessel along the spine and down the Ren (Conception) vessel along the front of the body."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "During Somatic Trauma Release (Lesson 2), what does the appearance of 'neurogenic tremors' typically signify in a client?",
            "options": ["A sign of physical exhaustion and muscle failure", "A dangerous seizure-like state that requires immediate cessation", "The nervous system discharging stored sympathetic charge (the 'freeze' response)", "An allergic reaction to the ritual incense or oils"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurogenic tremors are a natural physiological response indicating that the nervous system is releasing trapped 'fight-or-flight' energy from the 'freeze' state."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "The technique of 'Transfiguration' (Lesson 3) requires the practitioner to view the partner as:",
            "options": ["A psychological mirror of their own childhood wounds", "A manifestation of the Divine (Shiva or Shakti) beyond their personality", "An object for the projection of repressed sexual fantasies", "A physical vessel that must be drained of all egoic desire"],

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "In Advanced Breathwork (Lesson 4), what is the primary energetic purpose of 'Antara Kumbhaka' (internal breath retention)?",
            "options": ["To lower the heart rate as much as possible to induce sleep", "To build internal pressure and expand the energetic capacity to hold pleasure", "To starve the brain of oxygen to induce hallucinations", "To signal the body to begin the 'Release' phase of trauma work"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal retention (Antara Kumbhaka) builds 'Pranic' pressure, which helps expand the capacity of the nervous system to sustain high-frequency ecstatic states."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "According to Neuro-Tantric Mapping (Lesson 5), 'Ecstatic Neuroplasticity' is best facilitated by:",
            "options": ["Avoiding all high-arousal states to prevent nervous system overload", "Pairing high-intensity arousal with a deep sense of safety and presence", "Using external stimulants to force the nervous system into new patterns", "Practicing in total sensory deprivation to focus solely on the brain"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity occurs when the brain is 'rewired' by experiencing high-arousal (pleasure) within a context of absolute safety (parasympathetic dominance)."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "Which Bandha is specifically used in Sexual Alchemy (Lesson 6) to redirect 'Apana Vayu' (downward-moving energy) upward toward the higher centers?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mula Bandha, the root lock, is used to seal the lower gateway and redirect energy that would otherwise flow downward and out of the body."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "In Advanced Ritual Design (Lesson 7), why is 'Olfactory Anchoring' (scent) considered a powerful tool for sanctuary containers?",
            "options": ["Scent is the only sense that bypasses the thalamus and goes directly to the limbic system", "Scent helps to mask the natural smells of the human body during ritual", "Scent is used primarily to distract the client from physical pain", "Scent has no effect on the nervous system and is purely for aesthetic"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The olfactory system has a direct link to the limbic system (emotional center), making it the fastest way to anchor a state of safety or sacredness."

            "id": "q23_8",

            "explanation": "The 'Golden Shadow' refers to the positive attributes and potential we have suppressed or projected onto 'heroes' or partners because we don't feel worthy of them."

            "question": "A client enters a 'high-frequency state' and begins to feel overwhelmed or 'un-grounded.' Which technique from Lesson 5 or 7 is most appropriate?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prolonged, audible exhalations (vocal toning) stimulate the Vagus nerve to engage the parasympathetic 'brake,' bringing the client back into a regulated state."
