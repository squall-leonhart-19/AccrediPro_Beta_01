                "To determine the client's financial ability to pay for long-term treatment",
                "To provide a physiological 'safe harbor' the client can return to if they become dysregulated",
                "To ensure the practitioner has enough energy to complete the session",
                "To bypass the need for informed consent during touch-based interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Somatic Resource is a physical sensation of safety or neutrality that acts as an anchor, preventing re-traumatization during deep energetic or somatic work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "Ecstatic goals are purely theoretical and cannot be measured",
                "Ecstatic goals focus on the expansion of pleasure, consciousness, and peak states beyond the mere absence of symptoms",
                "Ecstatic goals are only used for clients who have no history of trauma",
                "Ecstatic goals prioritize the practitioner's experience over the client's"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While clinical goals focus on healing (pathology-based), ecstatic goals focus on self-actualization and the expansion of the client's capacity for pleasure and bliss."

                "To ensure the session ends exactly on time",
                "Because the practitioner is usually too tired to continue",
                "Integration is optional and only used if the client requests it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Without integration, the nervous system remains in a state of high arousal, which can lead to post-session anxiety or 'hangovers' rather than lasting change."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A freeze response indicates the nervous system has moved outside the Window of Tolerance; grounding and resourcing are required to bring the client back to safety."
