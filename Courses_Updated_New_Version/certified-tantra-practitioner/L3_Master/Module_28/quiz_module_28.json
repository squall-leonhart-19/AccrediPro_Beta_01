            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "A client begins experiencing auditory hallucinations and a complete loss of orientation to time and place during a breathwork session. According to the Clinical Triage protocol in L1, what is the immediate priority?",
            "options": [
                "Deepen the breathwork to 'break through' the resistance",
                "Immediate cessation of the practice and referral to emergency psychiatric services",
                "Apply grounding touch to the client's feet to bring them back to the body",
                "Encourage the client to describe the hallucinations to integrate the 'shadow'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active psychosis, including auditory hallucinations and loss of orientation, is a 'hard' red flag that requires immediate clinical referral and cessation of tantric work."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "During a session, a client enters a somatic abreaction characterized by uncontrollable shaking and vocalizing. What is the practitioner's primary role during this 'acute trauma release'?",
            "options": [
                "To interpret the meaning of the shaking for the client",
                "To restrain the client to prevent physical injury",
                "To hold a safe, non-interfering container while ensuring the client remains in their 'Window of Tolerance'",
                "To immediately stop the shaking by applying pressure to the sternum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing abreaction involves 'witnessing' and maintaining safety, ensuring the client does not become overwhelmed (flooded) while allowing the nervous system to complete the discharge."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to the work of Stanislav Grof discussed in L3, what is a primary differentiator between a 'Spiritual Emergency' (Kundalini crisis) and a standard psychotic break?",
            "options": [
                "Spiritual emergencies never involve visual disturbances",
                "The individual in a spiritual emergency typically maintains some capacity for self-observation and insight",
                "Psychotic breaks only occur in individuals over the age of 50",
                "Spiritual emergencies do not require any grounding techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A key feature of spiritual emergency is the 'observing ego'—the client's ability to recognize that the experience is unusual or transpersonal, whereas psychosis involves a total loss of reality testing."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Disorganized Attachment' (L4). How might this manifest during a tantric intimacy exercise?",
            "options": [
                "The client is consistently distant and intellectualizes all feelings",
                "The client is overly clingy and demands constant reassurance",
                "The client exhibits 'fright without solution,' alternating between seeking closeness and sudden, fearful withdrawal",
                "The client is perfectly regulated and follows all instructions without emotion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment is characterized by a paradoxical drive to seek comfort from a source that also triggers fear, leading to erratic and unpredictable relational patterns."

            "id": "q28_5",

            "options": [
                "Immediately terminate the relationship without explanation to maintain boundaries",
                "Reciprocate the feelings if the practitioner also feels an 'energetic match'",
                "Acknowledge the feelings as a valid part of the therapeutic process and explore them as 'material' for the client's growth",
                "Tell the client their feelings are 'wrong' and a sign of poor progress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Erotic transference is a common occurrence in somatic work; the practitioner must hold the boundary while using the experience as a mirror for the client's internal relational dynamics."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Central Sensitization' in chronic pelvic pain. What does this physiological state imply for the Tantra Practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "The pain is 'all in the client's head' and should be ignored",
                "The nervous system has become hyper-responsive, meaning even light touch may be perceived as painful or threatening",
                "The practitioner should use deep tissue massage to 'break up' the pain",
                "Pelvic pain is always caused by a lack of sexual activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Central sensitization means the CNS is in a high-alert state; practitioners must use extreme titration and 'less is more' approaches to avoid re-traumatizing the nervous system."

                "Encouraging more rapid breathing to 'clear the energy'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orienting to the physical environment helps pull the client out of a traumatic loop or internal flooding and back into the present moment and the social engagement system."

                "A 'warm hand-off' where the practitioner coordinates with the new specialist and provides a clinical summary",
                "Stopping all communication immediately once the referral is made"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A masterful referral (warm hand-off) ensures continuity of care and prevents the client from feeling abandoned, which is crucial for long-term stability."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A practitioner notices they are staying up late thinking about a specific client, checking the client's social media, and feeling a 'need' to save them. This is a classic sign of:",

                "The Bodhisattva Vow"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner's own emotional history or needs are projected onto the client, often manifesting as a 'rescuer' complex or boundary blurring."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "When working with complex cases, what is the 'Window of Tolerance' (L7) referring to?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal zone for therapeutic work; if a client goes into hyper-arousal (flooding) or hypo-arousal (numbing), integration cannot occur."
