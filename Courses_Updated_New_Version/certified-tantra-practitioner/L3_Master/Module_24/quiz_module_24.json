            "question": "In the context of 'Architecting Multi-Dimensional Containers' (L1), what distinguishes a Master-level sanctuary from a standard professional setting?",
            "options": [
                "The use of high-end decor and expensive aromatherapy",
                "The deliberate layering of physical, energetic, and psychic boundaries to hold transpersonal states",
                "The requirement of silence throughout the entire duration of the session",
                "The removal of all clinical intake forms to prioritize intuition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level containers involve 'multi-dimensional' architecture, meaning the practitioner consciously manages the physical environment, the energetic field, and the psychic space to ensure safety during deep altered states."

                "The suppression of the Amygdala through deep breathing",
                "Limbic resonance mediated by the mirror neuron system in the brain",
                "The stimulation of the Vagus nerve through external sound healing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Limbic resonance allows a practitioner to feel the client's internal state within their own body, a process driven by the mirror neuron system, which is essential for somatic mirroring."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When navigating Complex Trauma (L3), why is the technique of 'Titration' critical during shadow work?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures the client experiences a full cathartic release in every session",
                "It prevents the client from accessing any difficult memories",
                "It breaks down overwhelming traumatic material into small, manageable 'drops' to prevent nervous system flooding",
                "It speeds up the healing process by forcing the client to face their fears directly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the processing of trauma into small increments, ensuring the client stays within their 'Window of Tolerance' and avoids re-traumatization."

                "Encourage the client to suppress the movement to maintain focus",
                "Hold the space with 'witness consciousness,' ensuring the client is safe while allowing the energetic discharge to complete",
                "Increase the velocity of the breath further to accelerate the release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Kriyas are natural energetic discharges; the practitioner should provide a safe container for the release without interfering or forcing the process, maintaining a grounded presence."

            "id": "q24_5",

                "The use of technology to facilitate remote healing sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transpersonal space refers to the shift from 'doing' (ego-driven intervention) to 'being' (non-dual awareness), where healing occurs through the quality of the shared field."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves recognizing transference as a common clinical phenomenon and 'holding' it skillfully without breaking ethical boundaries or shaming the client."

                "The administrative phase where the practitioner handles billing and scheduling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The liminal phase is the 'middle' of the ritual—the sacred space where the usual rules of time and identity are suspended, making profound somatic and psychic shifts possible."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability in high-level work requires external support (supervision) and internal maintenance (personal practice) to process the heavy emotional and energetic loads of clients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By using somatic resonance and mirroring, the practitioner can use their own regulated nervous system to 'entrain' the client back to a state of safety and flow."
