            "question": "In the S.A.C.R.E.D. Path framework discussed in Lesson 1, what does the 'E' represent in the context of Master-Level synthesis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the advanced synthesis of the S.A.C.R.E.D. path, 'E' stands for Energetic Evolution, referring to the practitioner's ability to facilitate the permanent upward shift of a client's baseline frequency."

            "options": [
                "It requires physical touch at all times",
                "It is an energetic field that exists before and after the physical session",
                "It is a strict set of verbal contracts and legal waivers",
                "It is only used for group workshops, not individual clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Meta-Container is the master-level ability to hold an energetic field that encompasses the client's entire transformation journey, often beginning weeks before the physical meeting."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Neural Resonance.' Which biological system is primarily responsible for the practitioner's ability to 'bio-hack' the client's nervous system into a state of calm?",
            "options": [
                "The Endocrine System",
                "The Mirror Neuron System and Vagus Nerve",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neural Resonance relies on the Mirror Neuron System for attunement and the Vagus Nerve to co-regulate the client's parasympathetic response through the practitioner's own physiological state."

            "id": "q29_4",

            "options": [
                "The client will fall asleep",
                "The client may experience 'Somatic Looping,' where the trauma is rehearsed rather than resolved",
                "The energy will dissipate too quickly to be useful",
                "The practitioner will lose their energetic sovereignty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without integration, catharsis can become 'Somatic Looping,' where the body simply repeats the traumatic expression without actually moving the energy through to a state of resolution."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "A 2023 study referenced in Lesson 5 found that practitioners who stabilized 'High-Voltage Vitality' shared which physiological marker?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV and strong Vagal Tone are the physiological prerequisites for holding high-voltage Shakti/Kundalini energy without causing nervous system burnout."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 describes 'Embodied Devotion' as the integration of the sacred into the mundane. How is this practically applied by a Master Practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "By only performing rituals in a dedicated temple",
                "By treating every interaction and 'mundane' task as a micro-ritual of presence",
                "By avoiding the mundane world entirely to stay in a high vibration",
                "By teaching clients to ignore their daily responsibilities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level integration involves the dissolution of the 'sacred/profane' binary, where mundane activities like washing dishes or answering emails are approached with the same devotion as a formal ceremony."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "No-Mind is a state of 'flow' where the practitioner responds to the client's energy intuitively and spontaneously, without the interference of the intellectual or 'planning' mind."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "explanation": "Ethical mentorship at the Master level requires the mentor to facilitate the 'individuation' of the student, ensuring they find their own unique medicine rather than becoming a carbon copy of the teacher.",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the 'Master's Legacy' regarding the mentorship of new practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "Creating students who replicate the Master's exact style",

            "question": "A client experiences a sudden 'energetic ceiling' where they feel stuck and unable to expand further. Using the principles from Lesson 4, what is the likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of physical flexibility",
                "An 'Integrity Leak' or unresolved somatic contraction in the transmutation phase",
                "The practitioner's field is too strong",
                "The client is not breathing deeply enough"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic ceilings are often caused by 'Integrity Leaks'—unresolved emotional or somatic contractions that haven't been fully transmuted, preventing the energy from rising further."
