            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "In the S.A.C.R.E.D. Container framework for trauma integration, what does the 'R' specifically stand for?",
            "options": ["Reciprocity", "Regulation", "Resilience", "Release"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regulation refers to the practitioner's ability to help the client stay within their Window of Tolerance, utilizing nervous system co-regulation to prevent re-traumatization during somatic work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "When working with clients experiencing chronic pain, which Tantric principle is most effective for rewiring the brain's 'pain-pleasure' pathways?",
            "options": ["Sensory substitution and focus shifting", "Aggressive kundalini awakening", "Extended breath retention (Kumbhaka)", "Total sensory deprivation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity allows the brain to shift focus from chronic pain signals to neutral or pleasurable sensations. Sensory substitution helps the client acknowledge pain without being consumed by it, expanding the capacity for pleasure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In the context of Conscious Conception, why is the 'Oxytocin-Cortisol' balance considered critical?",
            "options": ["Cortisol increases pelvic blood flow", "Oxytocin inhibits the implantation of the embryo", "High cortisol levels suppress the reproductive axis and LH surge", "Oxytocin is only necessary during the actual birth process"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress (high cortisol) activates the sympathetic nervous system, which can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, making conception more difficult. Tantra helps prioritize the parasympathetic 'rest and digest' state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "A client in the perimenopause transition feels a loss of 'Maiden' identity. How does a Tantric approach frame this hormonal threshold?",
            "options": ["As a pathological decline in femininity", "As an initiation into the 'Wise Woman' or Crone archetype", "As a period where sexual energy must be suppressed", "As a purely biological event with no energetic significance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tantra views hormonal thresholds like menopause as powerful energetic initiations, moving from the outward-focused energy of the Mother/Maiden to the inward-focused wisdom and sovereignty of the Crone."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of Queer Tantra when deconstructing heteronormative frameworks?",
            "options": ["To ensure only same-sex couples practice together", "To replace Shiva and Shakti with secular terms only", "To decouple energetic polarities from biological sex and gender roles", "To eliminate the concept of polarity entirely"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Queer Tantra recognizes that 'Shiva' and 'Shakti' (or masculine/feminine) are internal archetypal energies available to all, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation, allowing for more authentic expression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "When applying Tantra to Grief and Loss, what is the significance of 'The Void' (Shunya)?",
            "options": ["It represents a place of permanent depression", "It is a space of nothingness that should be avoided", "It is the fertile ground of pure potential where life and death meet", "It is a technical term for the end of a relationship"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Tantric philosophy, Shunya (the Void) is not 'emptiness' in a negative sense, but the source of all manifestation. In grief work, it represents the sacred space of transition and the non-dual nature of existence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "For a neurodivergent client with Autism, how might a practitioner adapt a traditional 'Eye Gazing' ritual?",
            "options": ["Insist on eye contact to 'break' the client's social anxiety", "Offer 'soft gazing' at a neutral object or peripheral gazing to reduce sensory overwhelm", "Cancel the ritual as it is impossible for autistic individuals", "Perform the ritual in a room with bright, flickering lights"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-informed Tantra requires sensory adaptations. Direct eye contact can be overstimulating or even painful for some autistic individuals; offering 'soft focus' or gazing at a shared object maintains connection without the sensory 'burnout'."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "How is 'Sacred Leadership' applied in a professional or corporate environment?",
            "options": ["By teaching sexual techniques in the boardroom", "By using 'Radical Candor' and embodied presence to foster psychological safety", "By ignoring professional boundaries in favor of 'total transparency'", "By requiring all employees to meditate for three hours daily"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sacred Leadership uses Tantric principles of presence, active listening, and energetic awareness to create a culture of trust, sovereignty, and authentic communication within professional structures."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A client presents with ADHD and finds traditional seated meditation frustrating. What is the best Tantric intervention?",
            "options": ["Tell them to 'try harder' to sit still", "Introduce 'Movement-Based Meditation' or Micro-stimming to channel excess energy", "Suggest they take medication before the session", "Only use guided visualizations where they are not allowed to move"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For ADHD brains, 'stillness' can sometimes lead to under-stimulation and mental racing. Movement-based practices (Tandava) or allowing small movements (stimming) helps ground the nervous system and achieve a flow state."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "In the context of End-of-Life transitions, what is the practitioner's primary role?",
            "options": ["To prevent the client from feeling any sadness", "To perform a medical intervention", "To hold a 'Midwife of the Soul' presence, facilitating the conscious release of the physical form", "To convince the client that they will not actually die"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tantric practitioners acting in end-of-life care serve as 'death doulas' or 'soul midwives,' helping the individual remain present and conscious during the transition, honoring the sacredness of the final release."
