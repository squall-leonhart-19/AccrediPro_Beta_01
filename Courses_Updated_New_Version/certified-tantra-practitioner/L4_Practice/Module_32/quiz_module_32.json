            "question": "When establishing the 'Professional Sanctuary' (L1), why is professional liability insurance specifically tailored for somatic work essential?",
            "options": [
                "It is a legal requirement for all home-based businesses regardless of industry.",
                "Standard general liability policies often exclude claims related to physical touch or emotional distress.",
                "It provides the practitioner with a license to perform medical procedures.",
                "It automatically guarantees zoning compliance in residential areas."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard business insurance usually covers 'slips and falls' (general liability), but somatic practitioners require professional liability to cover specific risks associated with touch, emotional processing, and the practitioner-client relationship."

        {
            "id": "q32_2",
            "question": "In the 'Conscious Intake' process (L2), what is the primary goal of the 'Resonance Screening' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client has the financial means to book a 10-session package.",
                "To gather as much biographical data as possible for marketing purposes.",
                "To determine if the client's intentions align with the practitioner's scope of practice and energetic container.",
                "To persuade hesitant clients to commit to deeper somatic work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonance screening is about energetic and professional alignment. It ensures the practitioner is the right fit for the client's needs and that the client is ready for the specific depth of Tantric work offered."
        },
        {
            "id": "q32_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Financial Architecture' lesson (L3), how does 'Value-Based Pricing' differ from 'Hourly Pricing'?",
            "options": [
                "It charges based on the practitioner's years of experience only.",
                "It focuses on the depth of transformation and energetic exchange rather than just time spent.",
                "It is always cheaper than hourly rates to attract more clients.",
                "It requires the practitioner to work more hours to justify the cost."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing reflects the profound life-shift or transformation the client receives, decoupling the practitioner's income from a strictly 'time-for-money' exchange, which often leads to burnout."

        {
            "id": "q32_4",
            "question": "What is the core philosophy behind 'Marketing through Authentic Connection' (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "Using high-pressure sales tactics to create a sense of urgency.",
                "Sharing curated, perfect images to establish an unattainable persona.",
                "Attracting clients by expressing one's unique 'vibrational signature' and transparent truth.",
                "Focusing entirely on SEO keywords rather than content quality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Authentic marketing in Tantra relies on 'resonance.' By being authentic and transparent about your journey and methodology, you naturally attract clients who are vibrationally matched to your teaching style."

        {
            "id": "q32_5",
            "question": "Which operational system (L5) is considered the 'nervous system' of a professional Tantra practice?",
            "options": [

                "Personal text messaging for all client communications."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An automated CRM/scheduling system reduces 'administrative friction,' ensuring that intake forms, payments, and reminders happen seamlessly, allowing the practitioner to remain in a 'holding' state rather than a 'managing' state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q32_6",
            "question": "Under 'Ethics and Liability' (L6), what is the 'Power Imbalance' protocol regarding dual relationships?",
            "options": [
                "Dual relationships (e.g., being a client's lover) are encouraged to deepen the work.",
                "Practitioners should avoid entering into secondary relationships with clients to maintain the integrity of the sacred container.",
                "Dual relationships are only acceptable if the client pays a higher fee.",
                "There is no power imbalance in Tantra because everyone is considered 'divine.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining clear boundaries is essential. Dual relationships cloud the 'transference' and 'counter-transference' dynamics, potentially causing harm and compromising the professional integrity of the sanctuary."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling to groups requires 'Field Management.' The practitioner must move from individual resonance to holding a container where multiple energetic processes are happening simultaneously among participants."
        },
        {
            "id": "q32_8",
            "question": "In 'Sustainable Mastery' (L8), why is 'Sadhana' (personal practice) considered a business operation?",
            "options": [
                "Because it can be written off as a tax expense.",
                "Because the practitioner's nervous system is the primary tool of the trade; if it is fried, the business fails.",
                "It isn't; it's a personal choice unrelated to professional success.",
                "Because it allows the practitioner to charge higher rates for 'spiritual' time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Tantra practitioner's primary 'product' is their presence and regulated nervous system. Personal practice (Sadhana) ensures the practitioner does not experience empathy fatigue or burnout, making it vital for business longevity."

            "id": "q32_9",
            "question": "A client expresses discomfort during a somatic session. According to 'Sacred Boundary Management,' what is the immediate required action?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage them to 'breathe through the resistance' and continue the technique.",
                "Immediately pause, acknowledge the discomfort, and honor the client's right to withdraw consent.",
                "Finish the current technique and then ask how they feel.",
                "Explain that discomfort is a necessary part of the healing process and should be ignored."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consent in Tantra is 'informed, enthusiastic, and revocable.' If a client expresses discomfort, the practitioner must immediately pause to ensure the container remains safe and the client feels empowered."
        },
        {
            "id": "q32_10",
            "question": "What does 'Releasing Administrative Friction' (L5) allow a practitioner to prioritize?",
            "options": [
                "Spending more time on social media marketing.",
                "Deepening their own embodiment and the quality of presence they bring to sessions.",
                "Taking on more clients than they can energetically handle.",
                "Reducing the cost of their sessions by cutting overhead."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By automating and streamlining the 'Earth' (logistical) side of the business, the practitioner frees up mental and energetic bandwidth to focus on the 'Spirit' (the actual healing work and their own development)."
