            "options": [
                "It allows you to charge the lowest prices to attract the most clients",
                "It reduces the need for any formal training or certification",
                "It creates 'Category of One' positioning, reducing competition and increasing energetic resonance with ideal clients",
                "It focuses solely on the physical aspects of Tantra to avoid emotional complexity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Niche specialization creates 'Category of One' positioning, which allows a practitioner to stand out by solving specific problems for a specific demographic, thereby increasing their perceived value and magnetism."

                "A legal requirement to have two practitioners present during every session",
                "The refusal to accept payment in any form other than digital currency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Double-Blind Boundary' (often called the 'Social Encounter' rule) protects client privacy by ensuring the practitioner does not acknowledge the professional relationship in public unless the client chooses to do so first."

        {
            "id": "q30_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, why is a 'Signature Program' (e.g., a 3-month container) recommended over 'A-La-Carte' sessions for deep Tantric work?",
            "options": [
                "It guarantees the practitioner more money upfront regardless of results",
                "One-off sessions are legally prohibited in most jurisdictions",
                "Deep transformation requires consistent nervous system regulation and sequential energetic unfolding that single sessions cannot provide",
                "It requires less preparation time for the practitioner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tantric transformation is cumulative. A structured program provides the container necessary for the nervous system to safely de-armor and integrate deep energetic shifts over time."

                "To identify the distance between the client's current 'Constricted State' and their desired 'Radiant State'",
                "To find gaps in the client's schedule for booking more appointments",
                "To determine which other practitioners the client has seen previously"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gap Analysis helps the practitioner and client understand the specific obstacles preventing the client from reaching their desired state, which justifies the necessity of the proposed intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Conscious marketing relies on 'Teaching Stories' and authentic visibility, which build trust and energetic resonance rather than using psychological pressure tactics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To prevent 'Compassion Fatigue' and 'Secondary Traumatic Stress,' practitioners require integration periods—especially after high-intensity containers like retreats—to clear their own energetic field."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
