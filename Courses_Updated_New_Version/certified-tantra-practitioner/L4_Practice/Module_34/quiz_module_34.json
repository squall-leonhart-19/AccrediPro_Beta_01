            "question": "When transitioning from private 1-on-1 sessions to group facilitation (Lesson 1), what is the primary energetic shift required of the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Micro-managing individual experiences to ensure everyone feels the same sensation",
                "Shifting from a 'Direct Guide' role to a 'Field Holder' who manages the collective container",
                "Increasing the intensity of personal touch to reach more people simultaneously",
                "Focusing exclusively on the most vocal participant to set the tone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In group facilitation, the practitioner must move from specific individual intervention to 'Holding the Field,' which involves managing the collective resonance and safety of the entire room rather than just one person's process."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "In 'Architecting the Sanctuary' (Lesson 2), which protocol is considered the foundation of a trauma-informed Tantric group container?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Law of Silence' where no one is allowed to speak for 48 hours",
                "The 'Mandatory Participation' rule to ensure no one feels left out",
                "The 'Red-Yellow-Green' consent system and the explicit right to opt-out at any time",
                "The requirement that all participants must share their deepest trauma in the first hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety and consent protocols, specifically the ability to opt-out and clear communication systems like the traffic light model, are essential for establishing the 'Sanctuary' required for deep Tantric work."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Arc of Tantric Transformation' (Lesson 3), what is the specific purpose of the 'Liminal/Descent' phase of a workshop?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Descent' or Liminal phase is designed to move beneath the surface of the ego, allowing participants to face shadows and energetic contractions before moving into the 'Ascent' or expansive phase."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Emotional Contagion' in group energetics. How should a Master Facilitator handle a 'ripple effect' of anxiety in the room?",
            "options": [
                "By matching the anxiety of the group to show empathy",
                "By ignoring it and continuing with the planned curriculum",
                "By utilizing 'Vagal Toning' and heart-centered entrainment to stabilize the field",
                "By asking the anxious person to leave the room immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Facilitators use entrainment—specifically through their own regulated nervous system and techniques like Vagal toning—to bring a dysregulated group back into a state of collective resonance and safety."

            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "During a 'Collective Release' session (Lesson 5), a participant experiences a vocal catharsis (screaming). What is the facilitator's primary task?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately silence them to prevent others from getting scared",
                "To encourage everyone else to scream louder to match the volume",
                "To maintain a 'non-anxious presence' while ensuring the participant remains physically safe",
                "To interpret the meaning of the scream for the group while it is happening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During catharsis, the facilitator must remain an 'unshakable anchor' (non-anxious presence), allowing the release to happen without judgment while monitoring for physical safety and preventing the group container from shattering."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 (Ritual Design), what distinguishes a 'Tantric Ritual' from a standard workshop exercise?",
            "options": [
                "The use of expensive props and specific costumes",
                "The intentional use of Invocations (opening) and Devocations (closing) to create 'Sacred Time'",
                "The requirement that all rituals must be performed in complete darkness",
                "The presence of at least 50 participants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ritual design relies on 'Sacred Time' and 'Sacred Space,' marked by clear boundaries of Invocations and Devocations, which separates the experience from mundane reality and allows for deeper expansion."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "What is the '72-Hour Rule' taught in Lesson 7 regarding post-program integration?",

                "Participants are required to post their experience on social media within 72 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '72-Hour Rule' is a safety protocol to prevent 'Post-Retreat Impulse,' where participants might make radical changes (like quitting a job or ending a marriage) while still in a heightened, non-integrated state."

        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "When scaling a Tantra business (Lesson 8), why is 'Niche Authority' more effective than 'Generalist' marketing?",
            "options": [
                "Because generalist marketing is always more expensive",
                "Because Tantra is too complex for general audiences to understand",
                "Because specific niches (e.g., 'Tantra for Conscious Couples') build higher trust and allow for premium pricing",
                "Because generalist marketing is illegal in most jurisdictions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Niche authority allows a practitioner to speak directly to the specific pain points and desires of a target demographic, which builds faster rapport and justifies the 'Premium' positioning of high-level programs."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "A facilitator notices 'Sub-Grouping' (cliques forming) during a 5-day retreat. According to Lesson 4, this usually indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The group is bonding perfectly and needs no intervention",
                "A fragmentation of the collective field, often due to a lack of safety or clear leadership",
                "That those specific people are the only ones doing the work correctly",
                "That the facilitator should join one of the groups to balance the energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sub-grouping or 'clique' formation is often a sign of 'Field Fragmentation,' indicating that the collective container isn't strong enough or that certain participants are seeking safety in smaller units rather than the whole."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "Which 'Integration' tool is recommended in Lesson 7 to help participants bridge the 'Ecstatic Gap' between a retreat and daily life?",
            "options": [
                "A 'Micro-Practice' that takes less than 10 minutes a day",
                "A mandatory 2-hour daily meditation requirement",
                "Encouraging participants to quit their 'mundane' jobs immediately",
                "Providing a list of 50 new books to read"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "To bridge the 'Ecstatic Gap,' practitioners should provide 'Micro-Practices'—small, manageable daily rituals that anchor the retreat's frequency into the participant's normal environment without overwhelming them."
