            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the S.A.C.R.E.D. Path Method™, why is 'Sanctuary' (S) established as the first step before any somatic work begins?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner maximizes their hourly billing rate.",
                "To shift the client's nervous system into a parasympathetic-dominant state, allowing for safe vulnerability.",
                "To explain the historical origins of Tibetan Tantra to the client.",
                "To induce a state of hyper-arousal necessary for spiritual visions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sanctuary is about establishing a 'neurochemically safe' container. Without a parasympathetic-dominant state (safety), the body remains in a defensive posture, making authentic somatic exploration and 'Release' impossible."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "During the 'Awareness' (A) phase, a practitioner asks a client to perform 'Internal Sensory Tracking.' This technique is primarily designed to enhance which neurological process?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the ability to sense the internal state of the body. In the S.A.C.R.E.D. Path Method™, cultivating interoceptive awareness via the insular cortex is vital for identifying emotional blockages."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "In Module 4 (Release), the concept of 'Somatic Armor' is discussed. What does this term specifically refer to in a Tantric clinical context?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Connection in this methodology is first and foremost an internal alignment—bridging the gap between the physical body and the spiritual essence (Atman/Soul) to create resonance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional ethics in the Certified Tantra Practitioner™ program mandate clear boundaries. Dual relationships create role confusion and can lead to unintentional exploitation of the client's vulnerability."
