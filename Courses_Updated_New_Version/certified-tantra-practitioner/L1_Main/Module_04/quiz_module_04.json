            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "In the study of Granthis (energetic knots), which knot is located at the heart center (Anahata) and represents the emotional attachment to people, desires, and the 'ego-personality'?",
            "options": ["Brahma Granthi", "Vishnu Granthi", "Rudra Granthi", "Shiva Granthi"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vishnu Granthi is located at the heart center and is associated with emotional bondage and the attachment to individual identity and compassion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to Wilhelm Reich’s theory of Somatic Armoring, which of the seven segments is often the first to form and manifests as a 'mask-like' expression or a lack of luster in the eyes?",
            "options": ["The Ocular Segment", "The Oral Segment", "The Cervical Segment", "The Thoracic Segment"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ocular segment is the first segment of armor, often holding the earliest traumas related to social contact and the 'right to exist.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A 2011 study published in the International Journal of Yoga demonstrated that the 'vibrational' aspect of vocalization (specifically 'Om' chanting) leads to significant inactivation of which brain structure?",
            "options": ["The Prefrontal Cortex", "The Amygdala", "The Hippocampus", "The Medulla Oblongata"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study showed significant amygdala deactivation, explaining why vocal discharge effectively reduces the 'fight-or-flight' response during emotional release."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "During high-intensity cathartic breathwork, the physiological state of 'Hypocapnia' (lowered CO2) can lead to 'Tetany.' What is the primary chemical cause of this temporary muscle cramping?",
            "options": ["Metabolic Acidosis", "Respiratory Alkalosis", "Lactic Acid buildup", "Hypoxia"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid breathing exhales CO2 quickly, raising the blood's pH level (Respiratory Alkalosis), which causes calcium ions to bind to albumin, leading to muscle contractions known as tetany."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "When working with a client to deconstruct 'Sexual Shame' (Lesson 5), what is the function of the 'Cognitive-Somatic Bridge'?",
            "options": ["To ignore the physical sensation and focus on logic", "To replace a shameful thought with a physical 'anchor' of safety", "To identify the specific age a trauma occurred", "To increase the intensity of the shame until it peaks"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The bridge allows the practitioner to help the client link a cognitive realization (e.g., 'this shame isn't mine') to a felt sense of safety in the body, facilitating neural rewiring."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Release (Lesson 6), what is the definition of 'Titration'?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to scream as loudly as possible", "The process of experiencing small, manageable 'drops' of trauma at a time", "A technique used to induce a trance state via rapid eye movement", "The manual application of heavy pressure to the pelvic floor"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves slowing down the release process so the nervous system can integrate the discharge without becoming overwhelmed or re-traumatized (flooding)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "During Foundational De-armoring (Lesson 7), why is the Diaphragmatic segment considered a 'gatekeeper' for emotional release?",
            "options": ["It controls the flow of blood to the brain", "It is the only muscle that is both voluntary and involuntary", "It physically separates the 'social' upper body from the 'instinctual' lower body", "It is where the majority of lymph nodes are located"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reich noted that the diaphragm acts as a barrier; when it is armored, it prevents the flow of energy and emotion between the heart/head and the belly/genitals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A client experiences a profound emotional release followed by a period of 'emptiness' or 'Sunyata.' What is the practitioner's primary role during this 'Void' phase?",
            "options": ["To immediately fill the silence with positive affirmations", "To encourage the client to get up and start moving to avoid depression", "To hold a space of quiet presence, allowing the nervous system to 're-baseline'", "To analyze the meaning of the release with the client"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Void' is a critical integration period where the brain undergoes neural reorganization; the practitioner should provide a safe, silent container for this process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "What is the 'Startle Response' and how does it affect external de-armoring techniques?",
            "options": ["It is a sign of a successful release", "It is a protective reflex that causes muscles to tighten, which can be bypassed by slow, conscious touch", "It is a technique where the practitioner surprises the client to induce catharsis", "It is the involuntary laughter that occurs during a session"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If touch is too fast or aggressive, the body's 'Startle Response' (sympathetic activation) will cause the armor to thicken rather than soften."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "According to the principles of 'The Alchemy of Sound,' which type of vocalization is most effective for releasing deep-seated grief and sadness?",
            "options": ["High-pitched screaming", "Short, staccato barks", "Low-frequency, elongated 'Ah' or 'Oh' sounds", "Rapid, rhythmic chanting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency, sustained vocalizations resonate in the chest and belly, areas typically associated with the processing of grief and deep emotional storage."
