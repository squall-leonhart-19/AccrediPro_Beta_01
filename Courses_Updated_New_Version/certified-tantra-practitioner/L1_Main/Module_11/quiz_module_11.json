            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Within the S.A.C.R.E.D. Path Method™, which stage is primarily concerned with establishing the 'Container' and ensuring the nervous system reaches a 'Safe-to-Feel' baseline?",
            "options": ["Awakening", "Sanctuary", "Resonance", "Embodiment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sanctuary is the foundational stage (the 'S') of the method, focusing on trauma-informed safety and the creation of a secure container for deep somatic work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Advanced Sanctuary), the 'Fawn' response is highlighted as a boundary challenge. What is a primary indicator of fawning during a practitioner-client interaction?",
            "options": ["Verbal aggression or challenging the practitioner's authority", "Physical withdrawal and avoiding eye contact", "Over-compliance and 'people-pleasing' to avoid perceived conflict", "Complete dissociation or loss of consciousness"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fawning is a trauma response where the client becomes overly compliant or agreeable to ensure safety, making it difficult for them to state their true boundaries."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the science of Interoception (L3), which brain region acts as the primary 'hub' for processing internal bodily sensations and emotional awareness?",
            "options": ["The Prefrontal Cortex", "The Insular Cortex (Insula)", "The Occipital Lobe", "The Basal Ganglia"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Insula is the primary brain region responsible for interoception—the ability to sense the internal state of the body, which is vital for somatic tracking."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Research on Bio-Electric Connection (L4) suggests that the heart's electromagnetic field (EMF) is significantly stronger than the brain's. How much stronger is the heart's electrical component compared to the brain's?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10 times stronger", "Approximately 60 times stronger", "Approximately 500 times stronger", "Approximately 5,000 times stronger"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The heart's electrical field is about 60 times greater in amplitude than the electrical activity generated by the brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In the Somatic Release protocols (L5), 'Titration' is used to prevent nervous system flooding. How is titration defined in a clinical setting?",
            "options": ["Applying deep tissue pressure to force an emotional release", "Breaking down traumatic charge into small, manageable 'drops' or increments", "Encouraging the client to relive the entire trauma at maximum intensity", "Using rapid breathing to induce a cathartic state"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of experiencing small amounts of distressed states at a time to ensure the nervous system can integrate the release without becoming overwhelmed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 covers Pranic Expansion. Which of the five Vayus (vital winds) is responsible for the downward and outward flow of energy, specifically related to grounding and elimination?",
            "options": ["Prana Vayu", "Udana Vayu", "Apana Vayu", "Samana Vayu"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Apana Vayu is the downward-moving energy responsible for elimination, reproduction, and grounding the practitioner's energy into the earth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In the context of Embodied Devotion (L7), what is the primary purpose of 'Liminal Space' within a ritual framework?",
            "options": ["To create a state of confusion that makes the client more suggestible", "To bypass the analytical mind and facilitate neuroplasticity through symbolic action", "To provide a rest period where no therapeutic work occurs", "To ensure the practitioner remains in a position of spiritual superiority"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liminal space is the 'threshold' state where the analytical mind relaxes, allowing ritual and intention to create new neural pathways and deeper emotional shifts."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "The S.A.C.R.E.D. Professional Standard (L8) emphasizes the 'Power Differential.' Why is this differential particularly sensitive in Tantric sessions?",
            "options": ["Because the practitioner is more spiritually evolved", "Because the client is often in an altered or regressed state of consciousness", "Because the practitioner is legally responsible for the client's medical health", "Because Tantra requires the practitioner to take control of the client's will"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The power differential is heightened because somatic work and altered states of consciousness increase client vulnerability, requiring strict ethical boundaries."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client experiencing 'sensory tracking' (L3) reports a cold, sharp sensation in their chest. Which practitioner response aligns with the S.A.C.R.E.D. method?",
            "options": ["'That is your heart chakra opening; try to push through the pain.'", "'Ignore the coldness and focus on your breathing instead.'", "'Can you describe the shape or texture of that coldness, and where its edges are?'", "'That sensation means you are resisting the healing process.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective, non-judgmental inquiry ('shape,' 'texture,' 'edges') helps the client stay in an interoceptive, observant state rather than a reactive one."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "According to Practitioner Ethics (L8), when is 'Informed Consent' considered fully obtained in a Tantric professional context?",
            "options": ["Once the client signs the initial intake waiver", "When the practitioner explains the session flow at the beginning", "When it is established at the start and continuously re-negotiated throughout the session", "If the client does not say 'No' during the session"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the S.A.C.R.E.D. Professional Standard, consent is a dynamic, ongoing process that must be updated as the session moves into different levels of intimacy or intensity."
