            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex (or insula) is the primary brain region responsible for interoception—the ability to sense the internal state of the body, including heartbeat, breath, and visceral sensations."

                "It connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain through alternate nostril breathing",
                "It serves as a physical link between the gross physical body and the subtle energetic body",
                "It functions as the only autonomic process that can be consciously controlled, bridging the conscious and unconscious minds",
                "It acts as a bridge between the practitioner and the external environment through carbon dioxide exchange"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The breath is unique because it is both automatic and subject to conscious control, making it the ideal tool to bridge the gap between the voluntary and involuntary nervous systems."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "It is a helpful mnemonic device used to remember complex tantric rituals",
                "It is the mental story (e.g., 'this pain is bad') that we attach to raw sensation, often amplifying suffering",
                "It is the verbal instruction given by a practitioner to a client during a session",
                "It is the process of visualizing light moving through the chakras"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Narrative Overlay' is the cognitive story or interpretation we layer on top of raw sensory data. Deconstructing this allows us to experience sensation as pure energy rather than a 'problem'."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dharana is the practice of concentration—the active effort to bring the mind back to a single point. When this focus becomes effortless and continuous, it transitions into Dhyana (meditation)."

                "Encourage the client to 'push through' the coldness using forceful breathing",
                "Ask the client to observe the raw physical qualities (temperature, density) without labeling it as 'blocked'",
                "Tell the client a story about a past life trauma to explain the sensation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dynamic Awareness encourages the practitioner to guide the client toward the 'raw data' of the sensation (the coldness, the pressure) to deconstruct the narrative of 'blockage' and allow the energy to move."
