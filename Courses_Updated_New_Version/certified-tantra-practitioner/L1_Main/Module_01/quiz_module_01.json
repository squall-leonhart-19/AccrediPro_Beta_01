            "question": "In the context of the 'Sacred Container' (Lesson 1), what is the primary function of the 'Alchemical Boundary' during a Tantric session?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client remains in a state of hyper-arousal for maximum energy movement.",
                "To provide a defined energetic and physical space where the 'tension of opposites' can be safely held and transformed.",
                "To prevent the practitioner from feeling any of the client's emotional releases.",
                "To strictly limit the session to 60 minutes regardless of the somatic process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sacred Container acts as an alchemical vessel that holds the 'tension of opposites' (Vas Bene), allowing for transformation within a secure, bounded environment."

            "question": "Lesson 2 discusses the 'Alchemical Environment.' Which specific lighting adjustment is most effective for supporting Ventral Vagal activation (Neuroception of safety)?",
            "options": [
                "Bright, cool-toned LED lighting (above 5000K) to ensure clarity of vision.",
                "Total darkness to simulate the sensory deprivation of the womb.",
                "Warm, low-intensity lighting (2700K or lower) to mimic sunset and trigger melatonin/parasympathetic response.",
                "Flashing rhythmic lights to induce a trance-like state quickly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Warm, low-intensity lighting signals to the nervous system that the 'day' is over, reducing cortisol and supporting the transition into a parasympathetic (rest and digest) state."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to the principles of Energetic Sovereignty (Lesson 3), what is the 'Vessel Protocol' for a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "The practice of absorbing a client's 'heavy' energy and processing it through the practitioner's own chakras.",
                "Maintaining a clear distinction between 'mine' and 'thine,' ensuring the practitioner remains a witness rather than a sponge.",
                "A technique where the practitioner visualizes a glass wall between them and the client to prevent any connection.",
                "The requirement to shower in cold water immediately after every session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic Sovereignty requires the practitioner to remain a 'witness' (the vessel) rather than an 'absorber' (the sponge), preventing vicarious trauma and empathic burnout."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In the 'FRIES' model of consent discussed in Lesson 4, what does the 'S' stand for and imply in a Tantric setting?",
            "options": [
                "Spontaneous: Consent can be assumed if the energy feels right in the moment.",
                "Somatic: Consent is only valid if the client's body shows no signs of tension.",
                "Specific: Consent for one touch or practice does not imply consent for others; it must be granular.",
                "Sacred: Consent is a spiritual contract that cannot be broken once the session starts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific consent means that agreeing to a back massage is not an agreement to breast or genital touch; each new area or intensity requires its own specific 'yes'."

                "'I hope that this session helps me fix my relationship issues.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A potent Sankalpa is stated in the present tense ('I am'), is positive (focusing on what is wanted, not what is being avoided), and is concise."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 6), if a client begins to exhibit 'fawning' behavior—becoming overly compliant or 'people-pleasing'—which state are they likely entering?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fawning is a complex survival response often associated with a hybrid state of sympathetic arousal and dorsal collapse, where the client 'appeases' the practitioner to avoid perceived threat."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 addresses 'Resistance.' If a client suddenly becomes 'numb' or 'bored' during a session, how should the practitioner interpret this somatically?",
            "options": [
                "The client is being uncooperative and needs to be pushed harder into the practice.",
                "This is a 'Somatic Boundary'—the nervous system is using boredom/numbness as a defense against overwhelming intensity.",
                "The practitioner is failing to provide interesting enough techniques.",
                "The session should be terminated immediately as the client is no longer 'conscious'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Numbness and boredom are common 'protective' forms of resistance used by the nervous system when the level of intimacy or energy exceeds the current 'window of tolerance'."

                "The physical vibration felt in the room when the practitioner chants 'Om'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limbic Resonance is the neurobiological phenomenon where mammals pick up on the internal states of others; a regulated practitioner provides a 'template' for the client to co-regulate."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis on somatic safety (referenced in Lesson 6) suggests that 'Neuroception' occurs at what level of the brain?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is an 'infra-cognitive' process—the body detects safety or danger in the environment before the thinking brain even processes the information."

                "The practitioner sharing a brief personal anecdote relevant to the client's healing.",
                "The practitioner extending a session by 30 minutes for free because they 'felt a deep connection' with the client.",
                "The practitioner wearing professional, modest attire during a session.",
                "The practitioner asking for feedback at the end of the container."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extending sessions based on personal 'feelings' or connection is a 'slippery slope' boundary violation that erodes the professional container and creates dependency."
