            "question": "In the S.A.C.R.E.D. Path Method™, what does the 'R' represent, and what is its primary physiological objective?",
            "options": [
                "Resonance; to synchronize heart rates between practitioner and client.",
                "Release; to facilitate the discharge of stored somatic and emotional blockages.",
                "Radiance; to increase the visual glow of the client's skin through breath.",
                "Ritual; to establish a formal sequence of traditional movements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Release is the fifth stage of the S.A.C.R.E.D. Path Method™, specifically designed to dissolve somatic 'armoring' and emotional blockages through various therapeutic techniques."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on 'Sanctuary,' why is neuro-aesthetic design critical for a Tantric healing space?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures the room looks expensive enough to justify premium certification rates.",
                "It serves to distract the client from the intensity of the somatic work.",
                "It facilitates nervous system regulation by signaling safety to the amygdala.",
                "It is a traditional requirement of the ancient lineage of Tantra."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Architecture of Sacred Space' is focused on creating a container that triggers the parasympathetic nervous system, allowing the client's amygdala to relax so deep work can occur."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 defines 'Somatic Tracking' as a tool for Awareness. What is the 'Interoceptive Gap' mentioned in this context?",
            "options": [
                "The physical distance between the practitioner's hand and the client's body.",
                "The delay between a physical sensation and the cognitive labeling of that sensation.",
                "The emotional distance between a client and their primary partner.",
                "The space between the inhalation and the exhalation in circular breathing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Interoceptive Gap is the micro-moment between feeling a sensation and the mind's attempt to judge or label it. Mastery involves expanding this gap to allow for pure presence."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Connection), how is 'Energetic Resonance' scientifically measured in a practitioner-client dyad?",
            "options": [
                "Through the synchronization of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) patterns.",
                "By measuring the increase in body temperature during touch.",
                "By the volume of the client's vocalizations during the session.",
                "Through the speed of the client's pupillary dilation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Energetic Resonance is often reflected in HRV coherence, where the practitioner's regulated nervous system helps 'entrain' the client's heart rhythm into a state of safety and connection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "During the 'Release' phase (Lesson 5), a client begins to experience involuntary 'neurogenic tremors.' What should the practitioner do?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the session as this indicates a seizure.",
                "Apply heavy pressure to the shaking area to stop the movement.",
                "Encourage the client to suppress the movement to maintain decorum.",
                "Hold space and allow the tremors to continue as a natural discharge of the nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Neurogenic tremors are a healthy sign of the nervous system discharging stored tension (psoas release). The practitioner should provide a safe container for this natural process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 explores 'Expansion.' What is the primary risk of attempting to amplify Prana without first establishing 'Sanctuary' and 'Awareness'?",
            "options": [
                "The client will fall asleep too quickly.",
                "The energy may overwhelm an unregulated nervous system, leading to dissociation or 'spiritual bypass.'",
                "The practitioner will lose their own energetic charge.",
                "There is no risk; Expansion can be practiced at any time regardless of preparation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without the foundation of safety (Sanctuary) and presence (Awareness), high-voltage energy (Expansion) can be 'too much, too fast,' causing the client to shut down or dissociate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7 (Devotion), why is the 48-hour post-session window emphasized for 'Integration'?",
            "options": [
                "Because that is how long it takes for the essential oils to leave the skin.",
                "It is the standard time required for neuroplasticity and synaptic consolidation to take root.",
                "To ensure the client does not call the practitioner with questions too early.",
                "It is the traditional 'mourning period' for the old self in Tantric texts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is the process where the experiences of the session are 'wired' into the brain. The first 48 hours are critical for neuroplasticity and the stabilization of new somatic patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Professional Ethics.' What does 'Power Asymmetry' refer to in a Tantric session?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner having more physical strength than the client.",
                "The imbalance of energy between the masculine and feminine poles.",
                "The inherent vulnerability of the client compared to the perceived authority of the practitioner.",
                "The difference in financial status between the two parties."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Power Asymmetry is the ethical concept that the practitioner holds a position of influence and authority, requiring them to maintain strict boundaries to protect the vulnerable client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'numbness' in the pelvic floor during a session. Based on Lesson 3 (Awareness), what is the most effective coaching prompt?",
            "options": [
                "'Try harder to feel something there.'",
                "'Just ignore the numbness and focus on your breath.'",
                "'Can you describe the texture or temperature of the numbness itself?'",
                "'The numbness means you are not ready for this work.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic tracking involves bringing awareness to *what is*, including numbness. By asking for the 'texture' or 'temperature' of the numbness, you engage the client's interoception without judgment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Mastery' as defined in the synthesis of the S.A.C.R.E.D. Path Method™?",
            "options": [
                "Memorizing every Sanskrit term related to Tantra.",
                "The ability to perform complex rituals without looking at notes.",
                "The consistent application of presence, ethics, and somatic regulation in every interaction.",
                "Achieving a state of permanent ecstasy that requires no further practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery is not a destination but the consistent, ethical, and regulated application of the method's core principles (Presence, Awareness, Resonance) in professional practice."
