            "question": "During advanced Pranayama (L2), the practice of Antar Kumbhaka (internal breath retention) utilizes the 'Bohr Effect.' What does this effect describe?",
            "options": ["The reduction of oxygen in the bloodstream to induce hallucinations", "The release of oxygen from hemoglobin into the tissues due to increased CO2 levels", "The immediate cooling of the core body temperature", "The involuntary contraction of the diaphragm"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Bohr Effect states that an increase in CO2 (through retention) decreases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, allowing more oxygen to be released into the cells and brain for ecstatic states."
