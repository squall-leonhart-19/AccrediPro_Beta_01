                "Encourage them to go deeper into the trance to find more answers",
                "Provide a grounding stimulus, such as weighted touch or a glass of water, and facilitate meaning-making",
                "Immediately end the session and ask them to leave",
                "Start a new round of rapid breathwork to clear the disorientation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration requires grounding. Disorientation indicates a need to bring the client back into their body and the physical room before they leave the session container."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first step in Awareness is non-judgmental observation (Somatic Tracking). Validating the sensation and observing its qualities helps the client stay present without triggering a defensive response."
