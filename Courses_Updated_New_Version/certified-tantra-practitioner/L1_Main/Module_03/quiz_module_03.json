            "question": "In the context of 'The Physics of Resonance,' what is the term for the process where two interacting oscillating systems, such as the heart rates of two partners, fall into a synchronized rhythm?",
            "options": [
                "Entrainment",
                "Harmonic Distortion",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show that deep connection in eye gazing leads to pupillary entrainment, where the pupils of both partners dilate and contract in unison, reflecting shared autonomic nervous system states."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "The 'Dyad Breath' technique emphasizes the 'Circular Breath.' What is the specific energetic purpose of removing the pause between the inhalation and exhalation?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Tantric breathwork, the pause (Kumbhaka) is intentionally removed in circular breathing to create a continuous, unbroken flow of energy between partners, preventing the 'reset' of the energetic field."

                "The brain's field is 10 times stronger than the heart's",
                "The heart's electrical component is about 60 times stronger than the brain's",

                "Both B and C are correct"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The heart is the strongest generator of electromagnetic energy in the body; its electrical field is ~60x stronger and its magnetic field is ~5,000x stronger than the brain's."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin, often called the 'bonding hormone,' is released through skin-to-skin contact and is essential for creating the emotional safety required for Tantric resonance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious touch in Tantra is 'listening' touch, meaning the practitioner is sensing the client's energetic response and adjusting pressure and pace based on that feedback."
