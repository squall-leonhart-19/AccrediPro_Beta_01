                "It serves as a purely aesthetic backdrop to increase client satisfaction.",
                "It facilitates a transition from the 'profane' world to a sacred state where the nervous system can safely down-regulate.",
                "It is a mandatory requirement for insurance compliance in holistic practices.",
                "It ensures that the practitioner remains the dominant authority figure in the room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liminal space acts as a threshold, allowing the client to leave behind external stressors and enter a state of neurobiological safety, which is a prerequisite for deep energetic work."

            "question": "During 'Connection' (L3), heart-brain coherence is mentioned. At what specific frequency does the heart typically oscillate when in a state of deep energetic resonance with another?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Embodied consent goes beyond verbal agreement; it requires the practitioner to track the client's non-verbal cues (breath, tension, skin flush) to ensure the body is also in agreement."
