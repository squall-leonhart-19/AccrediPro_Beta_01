            "question": "What is the primary bio-energetic purpose of 'Strategy' within the Human Design System?",
            "options": [
                "To bypass the mind's conditioned decision-making and align the aura with its correct geometry.",
                "To provide a moral framework for making ethical choices in business.",
                "To increase the frequency of the heart center to manifest desires faster.",
                "To analyze the personality's motivations through logical deduction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Strategy is designed to move decision-making from the conditioned mind to the body's energetic intelligence (the aura), ensuring the individual moves through life with the least resistance."
        },

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Sacral Response' for Generators is described as a somatic experience. Which of the following best describes a true response?",
            "options": [
                "A calculated 'yes' after weighing the pros and cons of a situation.",
                "An expansive, rising energy or guttural sound (like 'uh-huh') occurring in the moment an external stimulus is presented.",
                "A feeling of peace that comes after sleeping on a decision for several days.",
                "A sudden mental insight that explains why a specific path is the most logical."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sacral response is an immediate, somatic reaction to an external stimulus, often manifesting as an upward surge of energy or involuntary guttural sounds."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A Manifestor client is experiencing 'Anger' frequently. According to Lesson 3, what is the most likely tactical adjustment needed?",
            "options": [
                "They need to wait for an invitation before speaking.",
                "They need to wait for a full lunar cycle to ensure clarity.",
                "They must practice 'Informing' those in their impact field before they initiate action.",
                "They should stop initiating and wait for a sacral response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anger is the 'Not-Self' theme of the Manifestor. It usually arises when they face resistance because they failed to inform others of their intentions, causing others to get in their way."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Marcus' (Lesson 4), why did his 'cold-calling' sales strategy fail despite his high intelligence as a Projector?",
            "options": [
                "He was not working enough hours to hit the statistical average.",
                "He was initiating from the mind rather than waiting for recognition and a formal invitation.",
                "Projectors are not designed to work in sales or high-pressure environments.",
                "His sacral center was undefined, meaning he had no energy for phone calls."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projectors require recognition and an invitation to share their guidance. Initiating (like cold-calling) without being recognized leads to bitterness and rejection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, what is the biological/energetic reason a Reflector must wait 28.5 days to make a major decision?",
            "options": [
                "To allow the mind to get bored of the idea so only the truth remains.",
                "To sample the decision through the consistency of the lunar cycle as the moon activates different gates in their chart.",
                "Because Reflectors have no internal consistency and must wait for others to decide for them.",
                "To ensure they have consulted with at least 28 different people."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflectors are lunar beings. Waiting a full cycle allows them to experience how a decision feels as the moon transits every gate in their chart, providing a complete 'sampling' of the energy."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 identifies 'Bitterness' as a specific Not-Self indicator. Which type does this belong to, and what does it signify?",
            "options": [
                "Generator; signifies they are working too hard.",
                "Manifestor; signifies they are being controlled by a partner.",
                "Projector; signifies they are feeling unrecognized or are forcing their guidance on others.",
                "Reflector; signifies they are in a toxic physical environment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bitterness is the Projector's Not-Self theme, arising when they guide without being invited or when their specific gifts are not being seen/valued."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7's discussion on Career, what is the 'Signature' of a Manifesting Generator who is successfully following their strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Success (Recognition of their guidance).",
                "Peace (Lack of interference).",
                "Satisfaction (The feeling of a job well done/energy well spent).",
                "Surprise (Delight in the environment)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Like pure Generators, Manifesting Generators seek 'Satisfaction.' This is the sign that their powerful sacral energy has been used correctly in response."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 8 suggests that 'Deconditioning' takes approximately 7 years. What is the biological basis for this timeframe?",
            "options": [
                "It is the time it takes for the subconscious mind to rewrite its primary neural pathways.",
                "It is the average timeframe for the majority of the body's cells to be replaced.",
                "It corresponds to the movement of Uranus through one-twelfth of the zodiac.",
                "It is the time required for the Sacral motor to reach full maturity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '7-year cycle' is based on the biological process of cellular renewal; it takes roughly seven years for the majority of the cells in the human body to be replaced with 'aware' cells."

            "options": [
                "Inform their current boss, then wait for the moon to transit.",
                "Respond (Sacral), then inform those impacted, then take action.",
                "Initiate a counter-offer immediately to show power.",
                "Wait for an invitation to read the email."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Manifesting Generators must first 'Respond' to the stimulus (the email), then 'Inform' those who will be impacted by their move before finally taking action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes that Strategy is an 'Experiment.' What is the most important metric for a student to track during this process?",
            "options": [
                "The amount of money they earn in the first 30 days.",
                "The level of 'Resistance' vs. 'Flow' encountered in their daily interactions.",
                "How many people agree with their new lifestyle choices.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ultimate test of Strategy is the reduction of resistance (Not-Self themes) and the increase of flow (Signature themes) in real-world application."
