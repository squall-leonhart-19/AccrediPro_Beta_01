            "question": "In the architecture of Human Design, how do the two pressure centers (Head and Root) differ in their primary function?",
            "options": [
                "The Head pressures the body to move, while the Root pressures the mind to think.",
                "The Head pressures the mind to conceptualize and find meaning, while the Root pressures the body to act and evolve.",
                "Both centers pressure the Throat directly to ensure manifestation occurs rapidly.",
                "The Head is a motor that fuels the Root, while the Root is a terminal that exhausts energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Head Center provides mental pressure (conceptualization/meaning), while the Root Center provides physical/adrenaline pressure (action/evolution)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The undefined Head Center picks up the mental pressure of others, leading the individual to waste mental energy on irrelevant questions or problems."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the 2022 study cited in Lesson 3, individuals with an undefined Root Center in high-pressure 'crunch' environments showed which physiological trend compared to defined Roots?",
            "options": [
                "Lower baseline cortisol but 40% faster recovery times.",
                "Higher peak cortisol spikes and significantly slower return to baseline stress levels.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 notes that undefined Roots often experience higher cortisol spikes and struggle to 'shake off' the adrenaline pressure once the external source is removed."

            "options": [
                "They should quit immediately as the energy has run out.",
                "They should use their willpower (Heart Center) to push through the stagnation.",
                "They should wait for a new response to re-engage the motor, as the plateau is a period of internal integration.",
                "They should switch to a Manifestor strategy to 'jumpstart' the motor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Sacral Plateau is a natural part of the mastery process for Generators; the key is to wait for a response rather than mentally forcing progress."

                "She must analyze her childhood to find the root cause of the wave.",
                "She should use 'Positive Affirmations' to force the wave back up.",
                "The emotional wave is mechanical and has no 'why'; she should observe the feeling without needing a mental explanation.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As taught in Lesson 5 and 8, the emotional wave is a motor frequency; attaching mental 'reasons' (Head pressure) to the wave leads to unnecessary suffering."

                "The color of the aura.",
