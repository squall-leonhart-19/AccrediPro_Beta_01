            "question": "According to the mechanics of energetic imprinting, how do undefined (open) centers function in relation to environmental energy?",
            "options": [
                "They generate a consistent internal frequency that resists outside influence.",
                "They take in, filter, and amplify the energy of those in their auric field.",
                "They act as a shield that reflects energy back to the source.",
                "They remain dormant until the 7-year deconditioning cycle is complete."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Undefined centers are receptive; they do not just take in energy, they amplify it, which is why the 'Not-Self' experience feels so intense in these areas."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Not-Self mind tries to protect the 'vulnerable' open centers by making decisions that aim to fix, prove, or avoid the pressures associated with those centers."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The undefined Root Center experiences the pressure of others as a physical 'motor' drive, leading to the Not-Self strategy of rushing to get things done to escape the pressure."

                "Their identity is fluid and is significantly influenced by their physical environment and company.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The undefined G Center is 'chameleon-like.' The deconditioning focus is realizing that identity changes depending on where they are and who they are with, making 'place' the most important factor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deconditioning is a cellular process. As old cells (which carry the memory of conditioning) die and are replaced by new cells while living one's Strategy and Authority, the physical body literally changes."

            "question": "During a Client Intake (Lesson 8), a client reveals they frequently 'blur the truth' or 'act out' to ensure they are the center of attention. Which center is likely conditioned?",

            "explanation": "The undefined Spleen amplifies the 'feel-good' or 'secure' frequency of others. The Not-Self fear is that they cannot survive or be safe alone, causing them to hold onto toxic situations."
