            "question": "In Human Design mechanics, what is the primary biological role of the Mind (the Ajna and Head centers) in decision-making?",
            "options": [
                "To act as the final 'Inner Authority' for personal life choices.",
                "To serve as 'Outer Authority' by processing information and sharing insights with others.",
                "To override the Splenic 'whisper' with logical evidence.",
                "To regulate the Sacral response through strategic planning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mind is designed to be an 'Outer Authority'—a resource for others and a processor of data—but it lacks the biological connection to the body's life-force centers required for personal decision-making."

            "options": [
                "Strike while the iron is hot.",
                "Trust the first gut reaction.",
                "There is no truth in the now.",
                "Wait for the invitation to speak your truth."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with Emotional Authority (Solar Plexus defined) must wait for their emotional wave to reach a point of neutral clarity; they are biologically designed not to have 'truth' in the immediate moment."

                "Asking open-ended questions like 'Why do you want this job?'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Sacral Center responds in the moment to binary (Yes/No) stimuli. Open-ended 'why' questions engage the mind, whereas Yes/No questions bypass the intellect to reach the gut response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Splenic Authority is rooted in the oldest survival system; it is spontaneous and quiet. If you miss it or 'think' about it, the mind usually overrides the impulse."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Self-Projected Authority comes from the G-Center. These individuals need to 'hear' themselves speak without the mind's interference to recognize the resonance of their own truth."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ego Authority is about the use of will and resources. It functions based on whether the individual truly 'wants' something and has the 'heart' to commit their ego-energy to it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mental Projectors have no centers defined below the throat. They process truth by speaking in a supportive environment, using the people around them as mirrors to hear their own thoughts."

                "3 days (the length of a transit through a gate).",
                "Approximately 28-29 days (a full lunar cycle).",
                "Until the sun moves into a harmonious hexagram.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflectors are governed by the Moon. A full lunar cycle allows the moon to transit every gate in their chart, giving them a complete perspective on the decision through all 64 gates."

            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Deconditioning the Mind,' what is identified as a primary sign that the 'Not-Self' mind is trying to take over authority?",
            "options": [
                "A sense of calm and indifference.",
                "The presence of 'Should' statements and internal pressure to decide quickly.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Not-Self mind often uses 'shoulds,' 'musts,' and urgency/anxiety to force a decision, bypassing the body's natural timing and authority."

            "options": [
                "Restart the certification process from Module 1.",
                "View the 'mistake' as data to observe how the mind tried to override authority.",
                "Ignore the mistake and try to force a Sacral response next time.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Human Design 'Experiment' is about awareness. Observing the consequences of following the mind versus following Authority is the most powerful way to decondition."
