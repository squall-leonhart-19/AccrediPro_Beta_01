            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' in the D.E.S.I.G.N. Framework™ stands for Evaluation, specifically focusing on identifying the areas of the chart where the client is most susceptible to Not-Self conditioning."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Projector aura is focused and absorbing. It penetrates the G-center of others, which is why an invitation is required to ensure the interaction is welcomed and not met with resistance."

            ],

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The foundation of any professional reading must be Type, Strategy, and Authority. Without these, the client cannot practically apply any deeper information like gates or channels."
