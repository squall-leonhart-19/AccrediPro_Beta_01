            "question": "In the context of 'Visual Synthesis' (L1), what is the primary energetic difference between a defined center and an undefined (open) center in the Bodygraph?",
            "options": [
                "Defined centers are where you are susceptible to conditioning, while undefined centers are your fixed strengths.",
                "Defined centers represent consistent, reliable energy you broadcast, while undefined centers are where you take in and amplify others' energy.",
                "Undefined centers are always 'broken' and need to be 'fixed' through alignment with a partner's chart.",
                "Defined centers only operate during specific planetary transits, whereas undefined centers are always active."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Defined centers represent your fixed nature and consistent energetic broadcast. Undefined centers are 'open' windows where you perceive, absorb, and often amplify the energy of the environment and others."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "A client with an undefined Root Center (L2) constantly feels a frantic need to finish their to-do list to 'finally be free' of the pressure. What is the core lesson for this individual?",
            "options": [
                "They must work harder to ensure all tasks are completed before 5:00 PM every day.",
                "They should only work in environments with other defined Root centers to borrow their focus.",
                "They must recognize this pressure is 'borrowed' and learn to sit with unfinished tasks without acting on the adrenaline.",
                "They should use caffeine to match the pressure they feel internally."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The undefined Root center experiences the pressure to 'get things done to be free of the pressure.' The mastery of this center is recognizing that the pressure is external and doesn't require immediate action."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Regarding the Awareness Centers (L3), which center operates on a 'spontaneous' frequency that only speaks once and does not repeat itself?",
            "options": [
                "The Ajna Center",
                "The Solar Plexus Center",
                "The Spleen Center",
                "The Heart Center"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Spleen is our oldest awareness center (survival). It operates in the 'now' and its voice is very quiet and instantaneous; if you miss it, it does not repeat the warning or nudge."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "A Manifesting Generator (L4) is frustrated because they keep hitting 'dead ends' in their projects. According to the mechanics of their Strategy, what is likely happening?",
            "options": [
                "They are waiting too long to act and losing their momentum.",
                "They are initiating from the mind instead of waiting for a response and then 'testing' the vision.",
                "They are not informing people enough about their intentions.",
                "They have a defined Ego center that is over-exerting itself."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Manifesting Generators often 'skip steps' or initiate from the mind. Their alignment comes from waiting for a Sacral response and then moving through the steps, often needing to backtrack if they initiated without a response."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "For a Projector (L5), what is the specific purpose of 'Waiting for the Invitation' in major life areas like career or relationships?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure they have enough physical energy to do the work themselves.",
                "To prevent them from ever having to talk to people first.",
                "To ensure they are recognized for their specific gifts, preventing the 'Bitterness' of being ignored.",
                "To allow the Manifestor in the group to take the lead first."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Projectors need recognition to be effective. Without an invitation, their guidance is often seen as intrusive or bossy, leading to the 'Not-Self' theme of Bitterness."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "A Reflector client (L6) is moving to a new city. Based on their core energetic mechanics, what is the most important factor for them to consider?",
            "options": [
                "The economic growth of the city.",
                "The 'feel' and 'vibe' of the physical environment and the people in it.",
                "How quickly they can find a job to stay busy.",
                "Whether they can find a Manifestor to initiate their new life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflectors are 'lunar beings' who sample the environment. Because they are entirely open, the quality of their life is directly dependent on the quality of their physical location and the people surrounding them."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Approximately 50% of the population has Emotional Authority (L7). What is the 'Golden Rule' for these individuals when making a decision?",
            "options": [
                "Follow your gut instinct in the moment.",
                "If it feels good right now, it is the right choice.",
                "There is no truth in the now; wait for the wave to reach a point of clarity.",
                "Logic is the only way to stabilize the emotional wave."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional Authority requires waiting for the 'wave' to pass. Decisions made at the peak (high) or trough (low) of the wave are usually impulsive and lack the clarity that comes from time."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Which Authority (L8) requires the individual to 'talk it out' with others—not to get advice, but to hear what they say—in order to recognize their own truth?",
            "options": [
                "Ego-Manifested Authority",
                "Splenic Authority",
                "Self-Projected Authority",
                "Sacral Authority"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Self-Projected Authority (common in Projectors) comes from the G-Center. These individuals need to use others as a 'sounding board' to hear the frequency of their own voice to know what is right for them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "In the hierarchy of Authority (L7), if an individual has both a defined Solar Plexus and a defined Sacral Center, which center dictates their final decision-making process?",
            "options": [
                "The Sacral Center (Truth in the Now)",
                "The Solar Plexus Center (Emotional Clarity over time)",
                "The Ajna Center (Logical Analysis)",
                "Neither; they must wait for a Lunar Cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Solar Plexus (Emotional Authority) is the highest in the hierarchy. If it is defined, it always overrides the Sacral, Spleen, or any other center. The person must wait for emotional clarity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A client with an undefined Spleen Center (L3) has been in a toxic relationship for 10 years. Mechanically, what might be keeping them there?",
            "options": [
                "They are waiting for an invitation to leave.",
                "The undefined Spleen tends to cling to things that aren't good for them because of the 'false' sense of security they provide.",
                "They have too much willpower and refuse to give up.",
                "Their Sacral center is saying 'Uh-huh' to the toxicity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The undefined Spleen often struggles with 'letting go' of what is unhealthy (people, habits, or jobs) because it fears it won't be safe or secure without that familiar connection."
