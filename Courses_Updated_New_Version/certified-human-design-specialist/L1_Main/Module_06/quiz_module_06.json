            "question": "What is the primary biological reason that the deconditioning process is traditionally cited as taking seven years?",
            "options": [
                "It takes seven years for the Magnetic Monopole to realign with the Design Crystal.",
                "Approximately 98% of the cells in the human body are replaced over a seven-year cycle.",
                "The Saturn cycle requires a seven-year 'square' to lock in new behavioral patterns.",
                "It represents the time needed for the Neocortex to bypass the Amygdala's fear response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The seven-year deconditioning cycle is rooted in the biological reality of cellular renewal; as old cells (conditioned by the Not-Self) die off and are replaced by cells grown while living according to Strategy and Authority, the physical body literally changes."

            "question": "In the 'Passenger Consciousness' metaphor, what is the correct role of the Personality (the 'I' that thinks)?",
            "options": [
                "The Driver who determines the direction and speed of the vehicle.",
                "The Engine that provides the consistent energy for the life's work.",
                "The Passenger in the back seat who observes the journey through the windows.",
                "The Navigator who interprets the map and gives instructions to the Monopole."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Human Design posits that the Personality is a 'Passenger.' Its role is not to drive (decide) or navigate, but to witness the life as it unfolds, establishing 'Witness Consciousness' rather than 'Doer Consciousness.'"

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A Projector client reports feeling 'bitter' despite following their Strategy. Upon investigation, you find they are 'waiting' but also 'initiating' conversations to get noticed. What does this indicate in the Alignment Compass?",
            "options": [
                "They are experiencing a 'Reflector Transit' affecting their emotional state.",
                "They are hitting a 'Mastery Plateau' where bitterness is a natural byproduct.",
                "They are meeting resistance because they are still using the Mind to force an outcome.",
                "Bitterness is the Signature of a Projector, so they are actually on the right track."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bitterness is the 'Not-Self Theme' (Resistance) for a Projector. If they feel bitter, it is a compass needle pointing to the fact that they are not waiting for the formal recognition and invitation, but are mentally initiating to seek attention."

            "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of 'Mind as Outer Authority'?",
            "options": [
                "Using the mind to make decisions for your own life based on logical pros and cons.",
                "Sharing the mind's unique perspective and gathered data with others for their benefit.",
                "Allowing the mind to override the Solar Plexus during emotional waves.",
                "The ability of the mind to dictate the physical movement of the body through willpower."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mind is never an Inner Authority for decisions. However, once it stops trying to run the life, it becomes 'Outer Authority'—a source of wisdom, research, and perspective that can be shared with others."

                "The mind becoming louder and more aggressive in its attempt to regain control.",
                "Instant manifestation of all physical desires without effort.",
                "A sudden change in the birth chart as the DNA deconditions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Not-Self Backlash' occurs when the Mind realizes it is losing its power over the life. It often responds by creating intense narratives of fear, urgency, or judgment to trick the individual back into mental decision-making."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Manifestor's Signature is Peace. When they inform before acting and follow their inner urge, the resistance (Anger) clears, leaving a state of peace in their wake."

                "Wearing protective crystals to block the energy of defined centers.",
                "Avoiding all contact with people who have 'Not-Self' tendencies.",

                "Focusing on 'Manifesting' a better social circle through visualization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aura integrity is maintained by following your Strategy and Authority. For example, a Generator saying 'No' to a social invitation they don't have energy for, despite the pressure to be 'nice,' preserves their sacral integrity."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A client in their 3rd year of the experiment feels they have 'hit a wall' and nothing is happening. According to Module 6, how should a Specialist reframe this plateau?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign that Human Design is not working for their specific body graph.",
                "As a period of 'Internal Integration' where the body is stabilizing new frequencies.",
                "As a need to study more advanced charts to stimulate the mind.",
                "As a requirement to change their Strategy to see if a different one works better."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plateaus are essential periods of 'Internal Integration.' Deconditioning isn't a linear upward curve; it involves 'stair-step' progress where the body must stabilize at a new frequency before the next level of awareness opens up."

                "The Exhaust system that releases deconditioned energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Magnetic Monopole is the 'Driver.' It sits in the G-Center, holds the Personality and Design crystals together in the illusion of separateness, and knows the trajectory of the life."

            "id": "q6_10",

                "Living as the 'Passenger' where Strategy and Authority happen automatically without mental interference.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery is not intellectual; it is the state where the 'Passenger' is comfortably seated in the back, and the 'Vehicle' (the body) operates through Strategy and Authority automatically, regardless of what the mind thinks."
