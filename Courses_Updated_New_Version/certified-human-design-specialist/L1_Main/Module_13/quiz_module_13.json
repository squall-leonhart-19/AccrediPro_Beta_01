            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The I Ching provides the 64 Hexagrams, which Ra Uru Hu mapped to the 64 codons of the human genetic code, forming the mathematical basis of the Bodygraph."

            "question": "In the mechanics of definition, what is required for a Center to be 'Defined' (colored in) on a Bodygraph?",
            "options": [
                "At least three active gates must be present in the center.",
                "The center must be connected to the Throat Center.",
                "A complete Channel must be formed between it and another center.",
                "The North Node must be positioned within that center's gates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Definition occurs when two gates on opposite ends of a channel are both activated, creating a 'closed circuit' that defines both connected centers."

            "options": [
                "The Head is physical pressure; the Root is mental pressure.",
                "The Head is mental pressure to 'know'; the Root is physical pressure to 'do' or evolve.",
                "The Head is emotional pressure; the Root is splenic pressure.",
                "There is no difference; both exert adrenaline-based pressure on the system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Head Center exerts mental pressure (inspiration/questions), while the Root Center is a motor that exerts physical, adrenalized pressure to move through life and evolve."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "A client has a defined Sacral Center but no connection to the Throat Center from a motor. According to Lesson 5, what is the primary characteristic of this Motor Center?",
            "options": [
                "It is a 'Manifesting' motor that acts instantly.",
                "It is the 'Life Force' motor that requires a response before releasing energy.",
                "It is a 'Projected' motor that requires an invitation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sacral Center is the powerhouse of the Life Force. It is a generative motor that must wait for something to respond to before its energy is correctly engaged."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Why is the Throat Center considered the 'Hub of Manifestation' in the Bodygraph architecture?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is the center of identity and direction.",
                "Because all energy in the Bodygraph seeks to reach the Throat for expression or action.",
                "Because it is the strongest motor in the human vehicle.",
                "Because it contains the Magnetic Monopole."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Throat is the 'Grand Central Station' where all channels and centers eventually lead to transform energy into words (speech) or deeds (action)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Magnetic Monopole in the G-Center acts as the 'Driver,' holding the Personality and Design together and attracting our specific geometry (direction) in life."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8 (Synthesis), the 'Red' (Design) and 'Black' (Personality) are discussed. Which statement best describes the 'Red' activations?",
            "options": [
                "They represent the conscious mind and what you think you are.",
                "They represent the body's intelligence and genetic inheritance, often unconscious to the individual.",
                "They represent the future potential of the soul's evolution.",
                "They are only active during the first 30 years of life (Saturn Return)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Red (Design) represents the 'Body' or the 'Vehicle.' It is the unconscious genetic data inherited from the ancestors, which the individual experiences but does not 'think' they are."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client with an Undefined Solar Plexus reports feeling 'volatile and emotional' only when they are at work. What is the most likely mechanical explanation?",
            "options": [
                "Their Solar Plexus is malfunctioning and needs 'cleansing.'",
                "They are experiencing 'Emotional Crashing' from their own defined motor.",
                "They are taking in and amplifying the emotional waves of defined colleagues (Conditioning).",
                "They have a 'Split Definition' that only closes when they are around others."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Undefined centers take in energy from the environment and amplify it. An undefined Solar Plexus person will feel the emotions of those around them more intensely than the people actually generating the emotions."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing a Bodygraph, what is the first step in the 'Decode' process according to the L1 methodology?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The foundation of any decode is the synthesis of definition to determine Type, Strategy, and Authority. Without this foundation, gate-level analysis is often misleading."
