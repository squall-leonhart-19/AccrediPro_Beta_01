            "options": [
                "It aligns with the orbital period of Saturn around the sun.",
                "It is the approximate time required for the majority of the body's cells to be replaced, allowing for a 'new' physical vehicle.",
                "It represents the time it takes for the Personality Crystal to fully seat in the Bodygraph.",
                "It is the duration required for the mind to lose interest in its old conditioning patterns."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Human Design posits that because most cells in the human body turn over within a seven-year period, it takes this long to physically 'wash out' the cellular memory of living as the Not-Self."

                "To use the mind to strategically plan a more successful life path.",
                "To shift the seat of decision-making from the mind to the body's Inner Authority.",
                "To achieve a state of permanent enlightenment through meditation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The fundamental goal of the Human Design experiment is the transfer of authority from the conditioned mind to the unique intelligence of the body (Inner Authority)."

            "options": [
                "They are successfully initiating new projects.",
                "They are meeting resistance because they are acting from mind-based initiation rather than response.",
                "They are experiencing a natural 'plateau' that occurs in the third year of the cycle.",
                "Their Sacral center is over-defined and needs more physical exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frustration is the 'Not-Self' signature of the Generator. It serves as a biofeedback mechanism indicating that the individual is initiating with the mind instead of waiting to respond."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic awareness involves identifying the specific physical sensations that accompany Inner Authority, helping the client 'ground' their awareness in the body rather than the mind."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-pressure or high-stakes environments, the mind often panics and tries to take control. Success in these environments requires doubling down on Strategy and Authority despite the mental pressure."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the DESIGN Framework™, 'Engage the Experiment' is a critical step where the coach helps the client move from theoretical knowledge to practical, daily application of their Strategy."

            "question": "A 2022 study on somatic decision-making (referenced in L4) found that individuals who paused for 30 seconds to 'feel' their body before deciding had a ____% higher satisfaction rate with the outcome.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As noted in the lesson, grounding techniques and somatic pauses significantly increase satisfaction (68%) by reducing the influence of impulsive, mind-based reactions."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "In 'Mastery of the Bodygraph' (L8), how should a specialist interpret the relationship between the 'Red' (Design) and 'Black' (Personality) activations?",

                "The Black is what the person thinks they are; the Red is how the body actually functions.",
                "The Red is the soul; the Black is the ego.",
                "The Black is the past life; the Red is the current life.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mastery requires recognizing that the Personality (Black) is the conscious 'Passenger,' while the Design (Red) is the unconscious 'Vehicle.' The client is often unaware of their Red traits until they are pointed out."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A Projector client in year 2 of their experiment feels 'bitter' because they aren't being recognized at work. What is the most appropriate coaching intervention based on Module 10 protocols?",

                "Tell them to work harder and make themselves more visible to management.",
                "Advise them to quit immediately as bitterness is a sign of a toxic environment.",
                "Review their somatic grounding and check if they are 'inviting themselves' into situations rather than waiting for recognition.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bitterness is the Projector's Not-Self signature. The protocol is to return to the basics of Strategy (Waiting for the Invitation) and Authority, ensuring they aren't forcing their presence where it isn't invited."
