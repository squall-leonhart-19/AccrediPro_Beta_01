            "question": "A Triple Split Definition client reports feeling 'incomplete' or stuck when working from home alone. Based on Lesson 1, what is the most effective 'Bridging' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting they define their own centers through intense physical exercise",
                "Moving to a public space like a cafe to benefit from the 'transit' of others' auras",
                "Focusing on deconditioning the G-Center to find internal wholeness",
                "Encouraging them to seek a single partner to 'complete' their chart permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triple Splits require movement through different auras to bridge their energetic gaps; being in public spaces allows them to 'sample' the bridges they need without the pressure of a fixed relationship."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'High-Pressure Chart' is defined by the presence of both a Defined Head and a Defined Root. What is the primary psychological risk for these clients?",

                "A total lack of motivation to complete tasks",
                "The 'Pressure Sandwich' where mental anxiety to know is coupled with physical pressure to do",
                "An inability to process emotional waves effectively",
                "Excessive reliance on others for direction and identity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Pressure Sandwich' occurs when the Head (Mental Pressure) and Root (Adrenaline Pressure) both push the individual, often leading to chronic stress and the 'hurry up and know' syndrome."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A CEO with Emotional Authority is operating in a 'Fast-Paced Environment' (Lesson 3). What is the critical 'Gold Standard' protocol for their decision-making?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For Emotional Authority, there is no truth in the now. In fast-paced business, a 24-hour buffer (or longer) is required to reach clarity and avoid the 'emotional hangover' of impulsive decisions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bitterness is the Not-Self theme of the Projector, occurring when they push their guidance onto others without an invitation, leading to rejection or being ignored."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflectors must wait a full Lunar cycle (approx. 28.5 days) for major decisions. Disappointment usually stems from being forced to operate at the speed of defined types."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sacral exhaustion occurs when a Generator spends energy on things that don't bring satisfaction. Root burnout is the result of the adrenaline system being constantly 'on' due to external pressure."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "The D.E.S.I.G.N. Framework™ (Lesson 8) uses the 'I' to represent 'Identify Gaps.' What does this specifically refer to in a complex client synthesis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
