            "question": "In the Architecture of Variable, if a client has the top-left arrow (Design Sensing) pointing to the Right, what does this indicate about their PHS (Primary Health System)?",
            "options": [
                "They require a highly structured, scheduled, and repetitive dietary regimen.",
                "They have a 'Passive' brain that requires lower caloric intake and varied, non-sequential stimulation.",
                "They must eat in a high-activity environment to stimulate metabolic processing.",
                "They are 'Strategic' and must focus intensely on the nutritional data of their food."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Right-pointing top-left arrow indicates a 'Passive' or 'Receptive' brain. These individuals often require less food than 'Active' (Left) brains and benefit from a relaxed, non-strategic approach to nourishment."

            "question": "When analyzing Cognitive Architecture, which Tone is associated with 'Inner Vision' and marks the transition from Strategic (Left) to Receptive (Right) cognition?",
            "options": [
                "Tone 1 (Security)",
                "Tone 3 (Outer Vision)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tone 4 (Inner Vision) is the first of the 'Right' tones (4, 5, 6), representing a shift from the externalized, strategic focus of Tones 1-3 to an internalized, meditative, and receptive cognitive process."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Uranus Opposition marks the 'mid-life' transition where the geometry shifts from the South Node (the breath of the past) to the North Node (the direction of the future)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 53-42 Maturation channel is the format energy for the Collective Sensing circuit, governing the experiential cycle and the ability to bring things to a proper conclusion."

            "options": [
                "'Nowhere to go,' indicating a stagnant relationship with no room for growth.",
                "'Work to do,' where the two open centers provide the primary areas of attraction and friction.",
                "'Fun and Games,' where the relationship is easy and lacks significant pressure.",
                "'Perfect Harmony,' where the couple functions as a single, unified entity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 7-2 composite is known as 'Work to Do.' The two open centers are where the couple is most vulnerable to conditioning and where the 'work' of the relationship takes place."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Quarter of Civilization is about 'building the world.' It focuses on the manifestation of the form and the creation of structures and systems (the Throat Center governs this quarter)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DreamRave matrix consists of the Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Spleen, and Ajna. The Heart (Ego) Center is not part of the mammalian sleep design, which is why 'Willpower' does not exist in the dream state."

            "options": [
                "They must be in a city with a population over 1 million.",
                "They require a 'closed' market where they have a specific, designated spot or office.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Color 2 (Markets) in its 'Left' (Internal/Hard) variation is 'Internal Markets,' which refers to a controlled, specific environment like a private office or a specific 'stall' in a marketplace."

            "question": "During a Professional Synthesis (L8), you observe a client with a 'Triple Split Definition' and all four arrows pointing Right (Quad Right). What is the primary coaching advice for this individual?",
            "options": [
                "They should use strict checklists and time-blocking to manage their energy.",
                "They must move through different environments to sample 'auras' to bridge their splits, while remaining in a state of 'receptive presence' without an agenda.",
                "They should avoid public places and focus on deep, solitary study to protect their receptive nodes.",
                "They should focus on 'Manifesting' their desires quickly before their energy splits cause hesitation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triple Splits need to move through different auras (like cafes) to bridge their definitions. Being 'Quad Right' means they have no strategic agenda, so they must simply 'be' in those environments and allow life to come to them."
