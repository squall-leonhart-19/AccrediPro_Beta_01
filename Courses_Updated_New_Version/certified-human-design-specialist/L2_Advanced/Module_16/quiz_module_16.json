            "question": "In the D.E.S.I.G.N. Framework™ introduced in Lesson 1, what does the 'S' represent in the context of holistic synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Sacral Authority Only",
                "Strategy and Signature",
                "Social Dynamics",
                "Subconscious Gates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the D.E.S.I.G.N. Framework™, 'S' stands for Strategy and Signature, which are the primary tools for determining if a client is in alignment or resistance."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the case study of the Burned-Out Manifesting Generator (Lesson 2), what was the specific 'Not-Self' behavior leading to their corporate exhaustion?",
            "options": [
                "Waiting too long for an invitation",
                "Initiating projects from the mind without a Sacral response",
                "Reflecting the stress of the environment",
                "Focusing on only one task at a time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Manifesting Generators often fall into the trap of 'initiating' like Manifestors. The case study highlighted that the client was using their mind to start projects rather than waiting for a Sacral response, leading to frustration and burnout."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "The 'Invisible Projector' in Lesson 3 achieved success by shifting their focus toward which specific activity?",

                "Ignoring all invitations to test their resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projectors gain the right invitations by being recognized for their specific mastery. The case study demonstrated that by focusing on their craft and sharing their insights publicly, the client became a 'magnet' for recognition."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",

            "options": [
                "Making a 'spur of the moment' decision based on excitement",
                "Following the 28-day Lunar Cycle to sample the decision through all gates",

                "Using an Inner Authority located in the Solar Plexus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflectors have no inner authority and must wait a full lunar cycle (approx. 28 days) to find clarity as the moon transits their chart, allowing them to 'sample' the decision through different energetic lenses."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5's case study on partnerships, what is the 'Emotional Wave' protocol for a couple where one partner is defined and the other is undefined?",
            "options": [
                "The undefined partner should make all the big decisions",
                "The defined partner must realize 'there is no truth in the now' and wait for clarity",
                "The undefined partner should try to fix the defined partner's mood",
                "Both partners should ignore emotions and focus on logic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For those with a Defined Solar Plexus, clarity comes with time. The case study emphasized that the defined partner must wait for the wave to settle before making commitments, while the undefined partner learns not to identify with the amplified emotions."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "According to the Entrepreneurial Generator case study (Lesson 6), what is the most reliable sign of a 'Sacral Yes'?",

                "Waiting for an external invitation from a mentor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Generator's Sacral response is a physical, guttural reaction. In the case study, the entrepreneur learned to distinguish between 'mind-led' ideas and the expansive energy of a true Sacral response."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In the 6/2 Profile case study (Lesson 7), what characterizes the transition at the 'Kiron Return' (approx. age 50)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 6th line profile moves through three stages. At the Kiron Return (around age 50), the individual moves from the observant 'on the roof' phase to the 'Role Model' phase, where they authentically embody their wisdom."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses Variable Integration. If a client has 'Left-Facing' (Strategic) Perspective, how should they ideally approach their goals?",
            "options": [
                "With specific, focused intentions and peripheral vision",
                "By having no goals and letting life happen to them",
                "With high-level, non-specific desires",
                "By ignoring the environment and focusing only on the body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Left-facing arrows (Strategic) indicate a need for focus, structure, and specific goals. This contrasts with Right-facing (Receptive) arrows, which thrive on non-specific manifestation."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "When integrating PHS (Primary Health System) into a case study, what does a 'Closed' or 'Consecutive' Appetite suggest about a client's eating habits?",
            "options": [
                "They should eat many different foods mixed together in one meal",
                "They should eat one simple food at a time to respect their digestive system",
                "They should only eat while distracted by television",
                "They should eat only during the night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consecutive (Closed) appetite is the most primitive digestive regime, suggesting the client processes nutrients best when eating simple, individual ingredients rather than complex mixtures."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Holistic Synthesis' when presenting a case study to a client?",
            "options": [
                "To list every single gate and line in the chart individually",
                "To provide a unified narrative that connects the chart's mechanics to the client's lived experience",
                "To predict the client's exact future using transit charts",
                "To convince the client to change their personality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the art of weaving individual mechanics (Type, Authority, Profile, Centers) into a cohesive story that helps the client understand their unique life path and challenges."
