            "question": "Which of the following statements best defines the 'Professional Scope of Practice' for a Human Design Specialist?",
            "options": [
                "The Specialist provides spiritual counseling that can replace traditional psychotherapy for trauma.",
                "The Specialist uses HD mechanics to assist self-awareness but refers clients to licensed professionals for clinical mental health or medical issues.",
                "The Specialist is qualified to diagnose personality disorders using the defined and undefined centers in a chart.",
                "The Specialist acts as a medical intuitive, using the bodygraph to prescribe specific nutritional supplements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Human Design is a tool for self-discovery and mechanics; it is not a substitute for medical or psychological diagnosis and treatment. Staying within scope means recognizing when a client's needs exceed the bounds of chart analysis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical concern regarding 'Guerilla' readings (reading someone's chart without their explicit consent)?",
            "options": [
                "It is only unethical if you charge money for the information.",
                "It violates the individual's right to their own energetic privacy and denies them the 'invitation' or 'initiation' into the system.",
                "It is actually encouraged as a way for the Specialist to practice their skills in public.",
                "It is only a concern if the person being read is a Projector."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consent is the cornerstone of ethical practice. Reading a chart without permission—even for 'research'—violates energetic boundaries and often results in the information being shared in a way the person is not ready to receive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A Specialist tells a client: 'Because you have a completely open G-Center, you will never have a consistent identity and are destined to be lost.' Why is this ethically problematic?",
            "options": [
                "It uses fatalistic language that strips the client of agency and creates a 'self-fulfilling prophecy' of failure.",
                "It is factually incorrect because the G-Center does not relate to identity.",
                "It is only problematic if the client is under the age of 18.",
                "The statement is actually ethical because it is mechanically true."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ethical communication avoids fatalism. Language should empower the client to see the 'openness' as a place of wisdom and flexibility rather than a permanent deficit or 'doom'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "When navigating the 'Not-Self' with a client, what is the most ethical approach to avoid shaming?",
            "options": [
                "Avoid mentioning the Not-Self entirely to keep the reading positive.",
                "Tell the client they are failing their experiment whenever the Not-Self appears.",
                "Frame the Not-Self as a protective mechanism and a 'signpost' for misalignment rather than a moral failing.",
                "Explain that the Not-Self must be 'killed' or eliminated through willpower."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shaming the Not-Self creates resistance. An ethical Specialist frames the Not-Self as a diagnostic tool that helps the client recognize when they have moved away from their Strategy and Authority."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "In the Specialist-Client relationship, where should the ultimate 'Authority' reside?",
            "options": [
                "With the Specialist, because they have the advanced certification.",
                "With the 'Source' (Ra Uru Hu's original teachings).",
                "Within the client's own Strategy and Inner Authority.",
                "With the Specialist's own Inner Authority."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To avoid unhealthy power dynamics, the Specialist must constantly point the client back to the client's own Inner Authority. The Specialist is a guide, not a guru or decision-maker for the client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "Regarding 'Financial Integrity,' why is it considered ethically questionable to promise 'total life transformation' in a 3-week coaching package?",
            "options": [
                "Because transformation only happens for Manifestors.",
                "Because biological deconditioning is a 7-year process, and promising 'instant' results ignores the actual mechanics of the body.",
                "Because 3-week packages are too expensive for most clients.",
                "It is not questionable; 3 weeks is the standard time for habit change."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 7-year deconditioning cycle is a fundamental tenet of Human Design. Ethical Specialists are transparent about the time and dedication required for cellular change, rather than selling 'quick fixes'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "How should a Specialist ethically handle 'Innovation' vs. 'Tradition' when sharing Human Design?",
            "options": [
                "They should never change a single word of the original 1987 transmission.",
                "They should present their own personal theories as 'original source material' to gain more authority.",
                "They should clearly distinguish between 'Source Material' (the original mechanics) and their own clinical observations or evolved perspectives.",
                "They should ignore the original teachings entirely if they find them too confusing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrity of the system requires respecting the foundation. While innovation is natural, a Specialist must be honest with clients about what is part of the original system and what is their own personal interpretation or synthesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Why is the Specialist's personal experiment considered an 'Ethical Duty'?",
            "options": [
                "Because it allows them to charge higher rates.",
                "Because without personal embodiment, the Specialist is merely sharing intellectual concepts rather than a lived frequency.",
                "It is not a duty; one can be an excellent Specialist without following their own strategy.",
                "Because the AccrediPro Standards Institute requires a daily log of experiments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Human Design is a cellular experiment. An ethical Specialist teaches from a place of embodiment. Sharing the system purely as an intellectual exercise without living it is a form of 'mechanical hypocrisy'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client reveals during a session that they are experiencing severe suicidal ideation. What is the ethically required action for the Specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Look at the client's Root Center to see where the pressure is coming from.",
                "Tell the client to follow their Strategy and wait for an invitation to feel better.",
                "Immediately refer the client to emergency services or a licensed mental health professional.",
                "Give the client a discount on their next session to help ease their stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acute mental health crises are outside the scope of Human Design analysis. The ethical and legal priority is the client's safety, which requires immediate referral to qualified clinical professionals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key indicator of 'Power Dynamics' imbalance in a reading?",
            "options": [
                "The Specialist encourages the client to record the session.",
                "The Specialist uses their knowledge of the client's 'openness' to manipulate the client into buying more sessions.",
                "The Specialist admits when they do not know the answer to a mechanical question.",
                "The Specialist asks the client for feedback at the end of the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using a client's chart vulnerabilities (like an undefined Will Center or G-Center) to create dependency or pressure them into financial commitments is a major ethical violation of power dynamics."
