            "question": "During the Professional Intake (L1), why is birth time rectification considered critical if the client provides a 'rounded' time (e.g., 12:00 PM)?",
            "options": [
                "It primarily affects the Personality Sun, which changes every 2 hours.",
                "A shift of even 4 minutes can change the gate of the Moon or the specific Line and Color values.",
                "The Incarnation Cross only remains stable for 30-minute increments.",
                "Rounding always results in an incorrect Bodygraph Type."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In professional analysis, precision is paramount because fast-moving elements like the Moon or the specific Lines, Colors, and Tones can shift within minutes, fundamentally altering the assessment."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In the Not-Self Diagnostic Framework (L2), a client reporting chronic 'bitterness' and a feeling of being 'overlooked' is exhibiting the primary Not-Self theme of which type?",
            "options": [
                "Manifestor",
                "Generator",
                "Projector",
                "Reflector"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bitterness is the hallmark Not-Self theme of the Projector, usually resulting from initiating without an invitation or failing to wait for recognition."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When performing Strategy & Resistance Mapping (L3), what is the 'Signature' indicator that a Generator is successfully following their Strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Peace",
                "Success",
                "Satisfaction",
                "Surprise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Generator's signature is Satisfaction. When they respond to life rather than initiating from the mind, the resistance (Frustration) is replaced by a deep sense of energetic fulfillment."

                "The ability to explain the logic behind their choice.",
                "The presence of 'clarity' over time rather than 'certainty' in the moment.",
                "The intensity of the emotional high experienced during the decision."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional Authority requires waiting for the wave to settle. Professional assessment looks for 'clarity'—a cool, calm state—rather than the 'certainty' or 'spontaneity' found in Splenic or Sacral types."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "In a Profile & Incarnation Cross Audit (L5), a client with a 3rd line (e.g., 1/3, 3/5, 6/3) is struggling with 'failure' in their business. As a specialist, how should you reframe this?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 3rd line discovers truth through trial and error. Assessment involves removing the shame of 'failure' and recognizing it as a necessary data-gathering process for their role."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During a Transits & Life Cycle Impact Assessment (L6), the 'Uranus Opposition' (occurring around age 38-42) is characterized by what major shift?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Human Design posits a 7-year deconditioning process, which correlates with the time it takes for the majority of the body's cells to be replaced while the individual operates correctly."

            "id": "q20_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regardless of complexity, the foundation of every professional report must be Strategy and Authority. Without these, the rest of the information remains theoretical and cannot be lived."

                "They are experiencing a 3rd line 'trial and error' phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anger is the Manifestor's Not-Self theme. It usually arises when they do not Inform, leading others to get in their way or attempt to control them, which creates resistance."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "The Chiron Return (occurring around age 50) is particularly significant in an assessment for which group of people?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For 6th line profiles, the Chiron Return marks the transition 'off the roof' and into the phase of 're-entering the world' as a role model, which is a critical period for life-cycle assessment."
