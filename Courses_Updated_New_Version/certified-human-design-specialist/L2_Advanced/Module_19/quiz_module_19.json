                "Human Design measures 'traits' while the Big Five measures 'mechanics'",
                "The Big Five is based on self-reported behavior (what you do), while Human Design is based on structural bio-energetics (how you are built)",
                "There is no difference; they are both based on the same psychological archetypes",
                "Human Design is only used for career coaching, while the Big Five is for clinical diagnosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychometric tests like the Big Five rely on subjective self-reporting of behavior, whereas Human Design is a system of 'Cognitive Bio-Mechanics' that describes the underlying structure regardless of behavior."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The seven-year cycle in Human Design aligns with the biological reality that most cells in the human body are replaced over a seven-year period, allowing for a physical 're-coding' of the system."

                "By telling the client what to do based on the specialist's intuition",
                "By ignoring the chart and focusing only on the client's current mood",
                "By correlating the client's subjective life challenges with objective mechanical patterns found in the BodyGraph and validated by research",
