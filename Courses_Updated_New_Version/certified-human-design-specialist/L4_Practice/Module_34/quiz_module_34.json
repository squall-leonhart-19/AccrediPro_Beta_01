            "question": "When decoding the 'Penta' (the trans-auric entity formed in groups of 3-5), which of the following is a primary characteristic of its energetic blueprint?",
            "options": [
                "The Penta possesses its own unique Emotional Authority and Solar Plexus awareness.",
                "The Penta is a non-emotional, functional entity focused on group survival and productivity.",
                "The Penta amplifies the individual 'Inner Authority' of every participant simultaneously.",
                "The Penta only forms when at least one Manifestor is present to initiate the aura."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Penta is a trans-auric form that emerges in groups of 3 to 5 people. It is a functional, non-emotional entity that prioritizes the 'survival' and 'flow' of the group rather than the individual growth or emotional awareness of the members."

            "question": "In the context of 'Facilitating Collective Deconditioning,' what does the term 'The Third Aura' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The aura of the facilitator when they are in a state of 'Flow.'",
                "The combined energetic field of the group that creates a unique 'shadow' or conditioning pattern.",
                "The specific aura of a Reflector when they enter a group environment.",
                "The energetic protection shield a facilitator uses to prevent burnout."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Third Aura' is the collective energetic field created by the interaction of individual auras. In group programs, facilitators must address this collective field to identify and decondition shared 'shadow' patterns that emerge among participants."

            "question": "You are designing a workshop track for a group of Generators. Based on the D.E.S.I.G.N. Framework™, which activity is most effective for their energetic alignment?",
            "options": [
                "A 20-minute silent visualization exercise to find their inner vision.",
                "A 'Sacral Session' featuring rapid-fire 'Yes/No' questions to practice response.",
                "A peer-led teaching session where they must initiate new concepts.",
                "A lecture-style presentation where they take notes for 90 minutes without interruption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generators thrive on response. Using 'Sacral Sessions' with 'Yes/No' questions allows them to practice their Strategy (To Respond) in real-time, which is the most effective way to engage their energy in a group setting."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "When teaching 'Authority' in a group context, how should a facilitator handle participants with Emotional Authority regarding group decision-making?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage them to make 'Spontaneous Commitments' to build group momentum.",
                "Pressure them to give a final answer by the end of the 60-minute session.",
                "Implement a 'No-Pressure Zone' that allows them to sleep on decisions before committing to group tasks.",
                "Ask them to ignore their 'Emotional Wave' for the sake of group harmony."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional Authorities require 'clarity over time.' In a group context, a facilitator must respect the 'No-Pressure Zone,' ensuring these participants aren't forced into immediate 'Sacral' or 'Splenic' style decisions that they may later regret."

            "question": "A participant with a Line 5 (The Heretic) in their Profile is enrolled in your high-ticket group program. What is their primary expectation of you as a facilitator?",
            "options": [
                "They want to hear your personal, vulnerable stories and 'behind-the-scenes' struggles.",
                "They expect practical, universalized solutions that 'work' and solve their specific problems.",
                "They want to be left alone in a 'hermit' cave and not participate in group calls.",
                "They are looking for a deep, experimental process with no clear end goal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Line 5s carry a 'projection field' of the Savior or Problem Solver. In a workshop or group setting, they expect the facilitator to provide practical, effective, and universal solutions. If the facilitator fails to deliver practical results, the Line 5's projection may turn negative."

            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on scaling the D.E.S.I.G.N. Framework™, what is a critical component of maintaining 'Energetic Integrity' in a high-ticket group program?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the number of participants to over 100 to maximize profit.",
                "Ensuring the group composition balances the functional gates of the Penta.",
                "Removing all type-specific tracks to create a 'one-size-fits-all' curriculum.",
                "Automating all interactions so the facilitator never has to engage with the group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling high-ticket programs requires 'Energetic Integrity.' One way to achieve this is by consciously curating group composition to ensure the Penta (the functional group entity) is balanced and productive, rather than just filling seats."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "What is the primary risk of 'Energetic Bleeding' in a facilitated group environment?",
            "options": [
                "The facilitator's bank account losing funds due to refunds.",
                "Individual participants losing their sense of 'Self' and adopting the group's homogenized 'shadow' identity.",
                "The workshop room becoming physically too warm due to collective body heat.",
                "A Manifestor initiating too many projects at once."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic Bleeding occurs when the group's collective aura (the Penta or WA) overwhelms the individual's design, leading to 'homogenized drift' where participants act from the group's conditioning rather than their own Strategy and Authority."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "In a group experiment (Lesson 6), if a Reflector is present, what role do they naturally play for the facilitator?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Engine' that provides the consistent energy to finish the workshop tasks.",
                "The 'Leader' who should be in charge of all group decisions.",
                "The 'Barometer' who mirrors the health and alignment of the group environment.",
                "The 'Salesperson' who will convince others to join the next program."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflectors are the ultimate barometers of any group. Their sampling aura allows the facilitator to 'read' the group's health; if the Reflector is struggling or 'disappointed,' it is a sign the group environment itself is out of alignment."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "Which facilitation technique best supports Projectors in a group workshop to prevent them from 'over-initiating' and burning out?",
            "options": [
                "Assigning them the most physically demanding tasks to 'burn off' energy.",
                "Using 'Recognition-Based Invitations' where the facilitator specifically calls on them for their unique insight.",
                "Telling them to 'just act like a Generator' for the duration of the weekend.",
                "Ignoring them entirely so they don't feel pressured to speak."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projectors need to be recognized and invited. In a group setting, a skilled facilitator 'recognizes' the Projector's wisdom and 'invites' their contribution, which prevents the Projector from pushing for attention and experiencing bitterness or burnout."

        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Energetic Containment.' Which of the following is a practical tool for a facilitator to maintain this?",
            "options": [
                "Allowing the group to talk over each other to encourage 'organic' growth.",
                "Setting clear 'Energetic Boundaries' and 'Group Agreements' at the start of the program.",
                "Ending every session 30 minutes early to avoid 'too much' energy.",
                "Only working with people of the same Human Design Type."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic Containment is maintained through clear structure and boundaries. Establishing 'Group Agreements' ensures the 'Third Aura' of the group remains a safe and productive space for deconditioning rather than a chaotic field of conditioning."
