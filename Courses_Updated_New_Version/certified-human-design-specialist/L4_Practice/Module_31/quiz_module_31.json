            "question": "In Lesson 1, what is defined as the 'Projector's Trap' when attempting to define a niche?",
            "options": [
                "Choosing a niche based on personal passion rather than market demand",
                "Broadcasting to everyone in hopes of being seen, rather than narrowing focus to become a 'Recognized Authority'",
                "Waiting too long for an invitation to choose a niche and never starting",
                "Focusing only on the technical aspects of the chart instead of the client's business problems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Projector's Trap' involves broad broadcasting (initiating) which leads to bitterness. Success comes from narrowing focus so that specific, aligned invitations can find the Specialist's recognized expertise."

            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Energetic Resonance' strategy in Lesson 2, how should a Generator Specialist approach content creation?",
            "options": [
                "By initiating 5-7 new topics per week to show leadership",
                "By using 'The Response Method'—creating content that answers specific questions or observations found in their community",
                "By focusing strictly on 'Informing' the audience about their daily schedule",
                "By only posting when they feel a sudden burst of Manifestor-like inspiration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generators thrive when responding. Content created in response to real-world stimuli (questions, comments, observations) carries a higher frequency of resonance than content that is forced or initiated."

            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "In the 'DESIGN' Discovery Call framework (Lesson 3), what does the 'S' represent?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' stands for Shadow Identification. This involves identifying the specific centers or gates where the client is currently living in their Not-Self, creating the 'pain point' that the specialist can help solve."

            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 emphasizes that 'High-Authority' case studies in Human Design must move beyond testimonials. What specific data point is required for a Tier-1 HD Case Study?",

                "The client's exact birth time and location",
                "A screenshot of the client's bodygraph",

                "A 5-star rating on a public review platform"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Deconditioning Delta' measures the transformation from frustration/bitterness/anger to satisfaction/success/peace, providing tangible evidence of the specialist's impact."

            "id": "q31_5",
            "question": "When architecting a High-Ticket Offer (Lesson 5), why is a 3-6 month container recommended over a single 90-minute reading?",
            "options": [
                "Because it takes 7 years to fully decondition, and a longer container supports the initial critical phase",
                "To ensure the Specialist has consistent monthly recurring revenue (MRR)",
                "Because single readings are technically illegal in most coaching jurisdictions",
                "To allow enough time to teach the client how to read their own transit charts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 7-year deconditioning cycle is a core HD concept. A 3-6 month container provides the necessary support for a client to actually experiment with their Strategy and Authority, rather than just collecting intellectual information."

                "Requiring the prospect to fill out an application before the call",
                "Sharing the price of the program at the beginning of the discovery call"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shadow-Based Selling pressures prospects to bypass their natural decision-making process. For an Emotional Authority, 'Fast-Action' pressure forces a decision before they have reached emotional clarity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LTV is maximized by creating an ascension path where the client moves from understanding themselves to understanding their relationships and professional life through the lens of HD."

            "options": [
                "Focusing on 1-on-1 intimacy and private mentorship only",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5/1 (Heretic/Investigator) is naturally designed for the 'General' role—providing practical solutions that can be universalized to the collective, making them excellent for scaling to large groups."

            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in Lesson 4 showed that specialists who used 'Signature-Based' social proof saw what percentage increase in lead quality?",

                "85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lesson notes a 54% increase in lead quality when specialists focus on 'Signature' outcomes (Success/Satisfaction) rather than just 'Chart Accuracy' in their marketing."

            "id": "q31_10",

            "options": [
                "In their 'Signature' of Peace",
                "Experiencing the 'Not-Self' theme of frustration/anger by trying to initiate like a Manifestor without a response",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anger and frustration are the Not-Self themes for MGs. This usually indicates they are trying to 'force' a launch (initiating) rather than responding to the market's needs and adjusting their 'Mani-Gen' speed accordingly."
