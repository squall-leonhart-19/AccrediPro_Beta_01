            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Human Design CEO focuses on scalability, which requires shifting from manual delivery to creating robust systems and frameworks that facilitate transformation without the founder's constant 1:1 presence."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Reflectors sample the aura of the group. If a Reflector in a group coaching program is struggling or 'cloudy,' it is often a sign of misalignment or stagnant energy within the entire collective container."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardized intakes streamline the 'Decode' process, allowing the Specialist to focus on high-level synthesis rather than administrative data gathering."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Bridge Hire' fills a functional or energetic gap in the founder's chart. If the founder lacks the 17-62 (Logic/Organization), hiring someone with this definition helps ground the business in structure."
