            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'The Energetics of Crisis,' which center is described as the primary driver of 'false urgency' in undefined individuals during a high-pressure event?",
            "options": [
                "The Root Center",
                "The Head Center",
                "The Solar Plexus",
                "The Ajna Center"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The undefined Root Center often absorbs and amplifies pressure, leading to a state of 'false urgency' where the individual tries to work faster to disappear the pressure, eventually leading to burnout."

                "Evaluating the client's financial stability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'E' stands for Energetic & Emotional Clearing, which focuses on identifying and discharging the 'Not-Self' baggage and trauma stored particularly in the client's open centers."

            "question": "A 'Sacral Crisis' in a Generator (Builder) is most accurately identified by which physiological and energetic state?",

                "Total depletion (burnout) and a 'frozen' or unresponsive Sacral gut-response",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sacral Crisis occurs when a Builder has consistently ignored their 'Uh-huh/Un-un' response, leading to adrenal fatigue and a Sacral center that no longer provides clear energy signals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Projectors enter a Bitterness-Burnout Loop when they offer advice or leadership without an invitation; the resulting rejection creates bitterness, which further depletes their limited energy stores."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because Reflectors sample their environment, being stuck in a 'toxic' location or community without variety leads to 'Energetic Constipation,' where they cannot clear the amplified Not-Self energy of others."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Split definitions often feel a deep sense of 'missing something' and look to the 'Bridge' gates/channels as the solution to their problems, making these areas highly vulnerable during a crisis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deconstruction involves mapping the current crisis symptoms to the specific mechanics of the client's chart to see which open or pressured centers are driving the crisis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triple Splits process information through movement and different environments; 'bridging' their splits by being in public spaces allows the energy to flow between their 'islands' of definition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In an active Emotional Crisis, the priority is to stop the 'leaking' of energy by preventing impulsive decisions made at the high or low of a wave, waiting instead for emotional clarity (The Neutral)."
