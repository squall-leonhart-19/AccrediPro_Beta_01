            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Professional Supervision' (L1), what is the primary distinction between 'Administrative Supervision' and 'Clinical/Reflective Supervision' for a Human Design specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Administrative focuses on chart accuracy, while Reflective focuses on client payment schedules.",
                "Administrative focuses on business compliance, while Reflective focuses on the practitioner's internal process and energetic hygiene.",
                "Administrative is only for Projectors, while Reflective is for all Types.",
                "There is no distinction; they are used interchangeably in the CHDS™ framework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective supervision is designed to explore the practitioner's subjective experience and energetic response to the client, whereas administrative supervision handles the logistical and compliance-based aspects of a practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triple Splits require movement and variety in their environment to allow different bridges to connect their 'islands' of definition; conceptualizing their case requires understanding that they are not 'broken' but need transit/public auric movement."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner absorbs the client's emotional energy (especially via open centers) and reacts to it as if it were their own, often distorting the professional container."

                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional, as Human Design is a self-actualization tool, not a clinical therapeutic intervention.",
                "Explain that their depression is simply a 'Not-Self' theme and tell them to follow their Strategy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CHDS™ scope of practice strictly mandates referral to licensed professionals for clinical mental health issues to ensure client safety and professional integrity."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The midway point of the 7-year cycle is often characterized by a 'reversion test' where the mind makes a final, aggressive attempt to regain control before the cellular renewal stabilizes in the latter half of the cycle."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainability for Projectors is fundamentally tied to the mechanics of recognition; initiating sessions or marketing without recognition leads to energetic exhaustion."

                "The client should avoid all learning as it overloads their system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Quad Rights are purely receptive; they do not have a strategic 'lens' for information. They absorb everything in their environment and 'pull' it out when needed, rather than storing it for specific future use."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-supervision requires the practitioner to understand how the 'Program' (transits) is currently conditioning them, which may color how they interpret a client's chart that day."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Split definitions with a single-gate bridge often create a 'deep obsession' with that specific gate's theme, leading the client to believe that fixing that one 'missing piece' will solve their life, which is a major deconditioning hurdle."
