            "question": "In the context of Parkinson's Disease, what is the primary mechanism of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS)?",
            "options": [
                "Using high-frequency pitch to stimulate the auditory cortex",
                "Providing an external temporal cue to bypass damaged basal ganglia circuits and improve gait",
                "Inducing a deep meditative state to reduce tremors through muscle relaxation",
                "Using binaural beats to increase dopamine production in the substantia nigra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RAS provides an external rhythmic cue that the brain uses to stabilize walking patterns, bypassing the impaired internal timing mechanisms of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's patients."

            "question": "When working with oncology patients, why is it critical to avoid placing vibrating instruments (like singing bowls) directly on the body near a tumor site or radiation field?",
            "options": [
                "Vibration may interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs",
                "The sound may cause the tumor to vibrate at a dissonant frequency",
                "Fragile tissue, risk of lymphedema, and bone density concerns in those areas",
                "Sound waves can reflect off the tumor and cause internal bruising"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oncology patients often have compromised tissue integrity due to radiation or surgery, and localized vibration can exacerbate lymphedema or cause pain in areas of bone metastasis."

            "question": "A client with PTSD begins to exhibit rapid breathing and 'spacing out' during a session. According to trauma-informed principles, what is the best immediate response?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the volume of the sound to 'break through' the dissociation",
                "Continue the session but switch to a higher frequency instrument",
                "Gently stop the sound, invite the client to open their eyes, and use grounding techniques",
                "Encourage the client to 'lean into' the discomfort to process the trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed practice prioritizes the 'Window of Tolerance.' If a client dissociates or hyper-arouses, the practitioner must stop the stimulus and use 'top-down' grounding to return them to safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies show that pre-operative sound therapy reduces cortisol and anxiety, often leading to a reduced need for pharmacological sedatives before surgery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children with ASD often struggle with sensory 'noise.' Predictable, low-frequency sounds provide a stabilizing 'container' that feels safe and reduces sensory overload."

            "question": "In Palliative and End-of-Life care (L6), what is the primary goal of using 'Musical Thanatology' or rhythmic entrainment?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the patient from their physical symptoms",
                "To match the patient's labored breathing and gradually slow the tempo to ease respiratory distress",
                "To provide a lively environment to keep the patient's spirits high",
                "To use sound to reverse the physiological process of dying"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners use sound to entrain with the patient's current physiological state (like labored breathing) and then gently lead the rhythm toward a calmer state to provide comfort."

            "question": "How does sound therapy support recovery in Addictive Disorders regarding 'Reward Deficiency Syndrome'?",
            "options": [
                "It replaces the drug of choice with a sound-induced 'high'",
                "It provides a healthy way to stimulate dopamine and GABA, helping to rebalance the brain's reward circuitry",
                "It creates a 'disgust response' to the addictive substance through Pavlovian conditioning",
                "It has no effect on brain chemistry; it is purely a distraction technique"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sound therapy helps stabilize the nervous system and can naturally increase dopamine and GABA levels, which are often depleted or dysregulated in individuals with addiction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Alpha-Theta border is the 'sweet spot' for flow states, where the mind is relaxed but highly creative and receptive to complex problem-solving."

            "options": [
                "It has been shown to reduce amyloid-beta plaques and improve microglial function in animal and early human trials",
                "It is the frequency that specifically triggers long-term memory retrieval",
                "It is the only frequency that can be heard by patients with advanced dementia",

                "The swinging motion of a pendulum used for diagnosis",
                "The process of swinging the client's mood from sad to happy",
                "The practice of moving between a 'resource' (place of safety) and a small amount of traumatic 'activation'",
