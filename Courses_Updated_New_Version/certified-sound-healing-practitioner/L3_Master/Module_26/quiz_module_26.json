            "question": "In the 'Arc of Transformation' multi-session model, what is the primary objective of the 'Stabilization Phase' (typically sessions 3-5)?",
            "options": [
                "To introduce the highest intensity frequencies and peak experiences",
                "To bridge the gap between initial clearing and deep neuroplastic integration",
                "To conduct the initial intake and baseline resonance assessment",
                "To finalize the home protocol and discharge the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stabilization Phase is designed to reinforce the shifts made during the clearing phase, ensuring the client's nervous system can sustain the new resonant state before moving into deeper expansion."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "When performing an Advanced Resonance Assessment (L2), which biometric marker is considered the 'gold standard' for measuring the cumulative impact of sound on the Autonomic Nervous System?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose Levels",
                "Respiratory Rate only",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV is the most accurate non-invasive measure of autonomic balance and the practitioner's ability to facilitate a shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance over a multi-session program."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Entrainment Staircase' protocol (L3), what is the maximum recommended frequency jump per interval to prevent 'Sonic Jarring'?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 Hz to 2 Hz",
                "5 Hz to 10 Hz",
                "15 Hz to 20 Hz",
                "Any jump is acceptable as long as the volume is low"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "To maintain a 'locked' entrainment state, frequency shifts should be gradual (0.5 to 2 Hz) to allow the brain's oscillatory patterns to follow the stimulus without triggering a stress response."

        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "For a client presenting with 'Hyper-Resonant Disharmony' (Anxiety/High Stress), which sequencing strategy is most effective in Protocol Development (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "Ascending scales using high-pitched crystal bowls",
                "Rapid, staccato percussion to match their energy",
                "Descending intervals (e.g., Perfect Fifth descending) into low-frequency drones",
                "Immediate silence followed by high-frequency tuning forks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Descending intervals and low-frequency drones provide a 'grounding' effect that helps down-regulate a hyper-aroused nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "In the 'Harmonic Scaffolding' (L5) framework, what is the purpose of the 'Sonic Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from the main healing frequencies",
                "A consistent low-frequency drone that provides a safety reference point for the brain",
                "The loudest instrument used during the peak of the session",
                "A home-care tool used only after the program is complete"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Sonic Anchor (like a constant drone) provides a psychoacoustic 'home base' that allows the client to feel safe while exploring more complex harmonic overtones."

            "question": "The 'Sustainability Ratio' for home protocols (L7) suggests that for every 60 minutes of in-office sound therapy, the client should engage in how much home 'Micro-Dosing'?",
            "options": [
                "60 minutes daily",
                "5-10 minutes of focused sonic practice daily",

                "3 hours of silence per week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistent 'Micro-Dosing' (5-10 minutes) is more effective for neuroplasticity and maintaining entrainment than infrequent, long sessions."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "When scaling a program from 1-on-1 to a group format (L8), what is the 'Inverse Square Law' challenge practitioners must address?",
            "options": [
                "The doubling of clients doubles the healing power",
                "Sound intensity decreases significantly as distance from the source increases",
                "Group energy always overrides individual frequency needs",
                "The cost of instruments increases exponentially"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Inverse Square Law dictates that sound intensity drops as distance increases; practitioners must ensure proper instrument placement so all group members receive an effective 'dose'."

            "question": "Case Study: A client in a 10-session 'Grief Recovery' program experiences a significant emotional plateau at session 6. What 'Strategic Entrainment' adjustment is recommended?",
            "options": [
                "Stop the program immediately as they have reached their limit",
                "Increase the volume of the instruments to force a breakthrough",
                "Introduce 'Harmonic Friction' (minor seconds or tritones) briefly to disrupt the plateau",
                "Repeat Session 1 exactly to return to basics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Controlled 'Harmonic Friction' can create a minor 'pattern interrupt' in the client's energetic field, helping to move past a plateau before returning to consonance."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course (n=1,200) found that multi-session programs (8+ sessions) showed what percentage increase in 'Well-being Sustainability' compared to single sessions?",
            "options": [
                "10%",
