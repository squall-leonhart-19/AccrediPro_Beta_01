            "question": "During the 'Resonance Assessment' (R) phase of the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. Method™, what is the primary objective of the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "To apply high-frequency tuning forks to the crown chakra immediately.",
                "To evaluate the client's current energetic frequency and identify specific areas of bio-acoustic disharmony or blockage.",
                "To guide the client through a 20-minute rhythmic breathing exercise.",
                "To select the loudest instruments available to penetrate the biofield."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. Method™ stands for Resonance Assessment, which focuses on identifying disharmony and energetic blockages before intervention begins."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Entrainment Strategy' (E), which principle of physics explains how a stronger rhythmic vibration can cause a weaker one to synchronize with it?",
            "options": [
                "The Law of Thermodynamics",
                "Sympathetic Resonance",

                "Biological Entrainment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the process where two oscillating systems synchronize. In sound healing, we use this strategy to bring biological systems (like heart rate or brainwaves) into a healing frequency."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "When performing 'Sonic Application' (S), what is the specific benefit of using weighted tuning forks directly on the physical body?",
            "options": [
                "They produce louder audible overtones for relaxation.",
                "They transfer mechanical vibration into the tissue and bone to stimulate mechanoreceptors.",
                "They are primarily used for clearing the room's atmosphere rather than the client.",
                "They eliminate the need for any other instruments in the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weighted tuning forks are designed for osteophony, delivering vibration directly to the body to stimulate cells and mechanoreceptors, unlike unweighted forks which are used primarily in the biofield."

                "They provide a single, pure sine wave that is easy for the brain to process.",
                "They contain multiple mathematical intervals that resonate with various layers of the biofield simultaneously.",
                "They decrease the client's sensitivity to sound."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Overtones (harmonics) are multiples of the fundamental frequency. They add depth and complexity, allowing the sound to interact with multiple energetic layers to 'open' channels of receptivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Perfect 5th (ratio 3:2) is the interval of stability and resolution. It is used in the 'N' phase to dissolve tension and neutralize the 'dissonance' of stagnant energy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta waves are associated with deep relaxation, dreaming, and the subconscious. Facilitating a shift into Theta/Delta is a key goal of the Transformation phase."

            "question": "In 'Treatment Planning' (M21), how should a session for a client with 'Hyper-arousal/Anxiety' differ from a session for 'Lethargy/Depression'?",
            "options": [
                "Anxiety requires high-pitched, fast rhythms; Lethargy requires silence.",
                "Anxiety requires grounding, low-frequency, stable rhythms; Lethargy requires uplifting, higher-frequency, and slightly faster tempos.",
                "Both should be treated with the exact same 528Hz frequency for 60 minutes.",
                "The practitioner should only use silence for Anxiety and only loud gongs for Lethargy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Treatment planning involves tailoring the sonic palette to the client's state. Anxiety needs 'calming/grounding' while lethargy needs 'activation/uplifting'."
