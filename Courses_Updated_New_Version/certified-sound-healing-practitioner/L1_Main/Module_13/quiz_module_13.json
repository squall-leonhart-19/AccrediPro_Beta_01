            "question": "During a Resonance Assessment (L1), a practitioner moves a tuning fork through the client's bio-acoustic field and notices the sound becomes 'dull' and the vibration stops prematurely. What does this bio-acoustic signature typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "An area of energetic 'void' or depletion requiring high-frequency stimulation",
                "A region of 'stuck' or dense energy where the field is non-resonant",
                "The client has reached peak harmonic coherence",
                "The tuning fork is defective and needs recalibration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In bio-acoustic mapping, a 'dull' or 'flat' tone usually indicates 'stuck' or stagnant energy (dissonance) that is absorbing the vibration rather than reflecting or resonating with it."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "The 'Sonic Roadmap' (L2) utilizes the Frequency Following Response (FFR). In the 'Pacing' phase of a session for a client with high anxiety, what is the correct procedural step?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately introduce 528Hz to promote DNA repair",
                "Use slow, grounding 100Hz tones to force the brain into Theta",
                "Match the client's current 'high-beta' state with slightly faster, active rhythms before slowing down",
                "Maintain a single monotonic frequency for the duration of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entrainment requires 'Pacing' (matching the current state) before 'Leading' (moving to the target state). Starting with a frequency that matches their current state prevents 'frequency shock' and allows the brain to lock onto the signal."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "When applying Sonic Tools (L3) to the physical body, what is the primary functional difference between a weighted and an unweighted tuning fork?",
            "options": [
                "Unweighted forks produce more physical vibration for bone conduction",
                "Weighted forks have 'weights' at the ends to create a stronger, longer-lasting physical vibration for on-body use",
                "Weighted forks are exclusively used for scanning the biofield from 3 feet away",
                "There is no functional difference; the weights are purely aesthetic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weighted tuning forks are designed with weights at the ends of the tines to focus the vibration into the stem, making them ideal for physical application on trigger points, bones, and tendons."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Harmonic Overtones, how do partials and overtones affect the human energy system?",
            "options": [
                "They create 'noise' that should be filtered out using digital tools",
                "They provide 'nutritional' sound that fills in gaps in the client's spectral resonance",
                "They are only audible to practitioners with 'perfect pitch'",
                "They decrease the efficacy of entrainment by distracting the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Harmonic overtones are considered 'bio-acoustic nutrition.' They provide a rich spectrum of frequencies that allow the body to 'select' the harmonics it needs for self-regulation and energetic flow."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5 (Neutralizing Dissonance), the Tritone (augmented fourth) is discussed. What is the strategic therapeutic use of this 'dissonant' interval?",
            "options": [
                "To induce deep sleep and relaxation",
                "To shatter 'stagnant' emotional patterns and create a window for reorganization",
                "To align the heart and brain at 0.1Hz",
                "It should never be used as it causes cellular damage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'scary' or 'unstable,' the Tritone is a powerful tool for breaking up energetic stagnation or 'frozen' emotional states, acting as a sonic catalyst for change before introducing consonant, resolving tones."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Internal Coherence (L6) is often measured via Heart Rate Variability (HRV). At what specific frequency does the heart-brain system typically achieve 'Resonance' or maximum coherence?",
            "options": [
                "440 Hz",
                "0.1 Hz",

                "40 Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 0.1 Hz frequency (roughly 6 breaths per minute) is the resonance frequency of the human cardiovascular system, where the heart, lungs, and brain synchronize into a state of high coherence."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Mechanotransduction' in cellular resonance. What does this process describe?",
            "options": [
                "The way the ear converts sound into electrical impulses",
                "The process by which cells convert mechanical sound vibrations into biochemical signals",
                "The use of machines to measure the aura",
                "The movement of sound through a vacuum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mechanotransduction is the physiological process where cells sense mechanical stimuli (like sound waves) and convert them into chemical activity, such as the release of Nitric Oxide or changes in gene expression."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "A client feels 'spaced out' or lightheaded after a session involving high-frequency crystal bowls. Which 'Embodied Integration' (L8) technique is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Playing high-pitched chimes near the crown chakra",
                "Using a weighted 128Hz fork on the K1 (Kidney 1) points on the soles of the feet",

                "Ending the session immediately without further sound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding involves moving energy downward. Using low-frequency, weighted forks on the K1 points or the sacrum helps 'anchor' the client back into their physical body after high-frequency work."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Which specific molecule, associated with vasodilation and immune response, is proven to be released by the application of a 128Hz tuning fork to the tissues?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",

                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (notably by Dr. John Beaulieu and others) has shown that the 128Hz 'C' tuning fork spikes the production of Nitric Oxide in the cells, which helps regulate blood pressure and reduce inflammation."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Designing the Sonic Roadmap' (L2), what is the 'Resolution' phase?",
            "options": [
                "The very beginning of the session where goals are set",
                "The middle of the session where dissonance is highest",
                "The final stage where consonant frequencies stabilize the changes made during the session",
                "The process of cleaning the instruments after use"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Resolution' phase is the final part of the sonic roadmap where the practitioner uses harmonious, consonant intervals to 'lock in' the new, coherent state and ensure the client leaves feeling integrated."
