            "question": "Which principle explains why weighted tuning forks are applied directly to the body while unweighted forks are used in the biofield?",
            "options": [
                "The principle of bone conduction vs. air conduction",
                "The Doppler effect in sonic movement",
                "The Law of Octaves in planetary tuning",
                "The destructive interference of pure tones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Weighted tuning forks utilize weights (clappers) to create a stronger vibration that is felt physically through bone conduction, whereas unweighted forks are designed for the subtle air conduction and frequency work in the energetic field."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "When performing the 'Rim Technique' on a Himalayan Metal Bowl, what is the primary factor in preventing the 'chattering' or 'rattling' sound of the mallet?",
            "options": [
                "Using a harder wooden mallet",
                "Maintaining consistent pressure and a vertical mallet angle",
                "Increasing the speed of rotation rapidly",
                "Striking the bowl before beginning the rim rotation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistent pressure and maintaining a 45-to-90 degree angle (depending on the bowl's lip) ensures the friction remains constant, preventing the mallet from bouncing off the surface which causes chattering."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In Crystal Singing Bowl application, what is a 'binaural beat' effect created by two bowls?",
            "options": [
                "The sound of the mallet hitting the quartz",
                "The high-frequency overtone produced by 99% silica",
                "The perceived third frequency created when two bowls with slightly different hertz are played simultaneously",
                "The reflection of sound off the walls of the treatment room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A binaural beat (or monaural beat in open air) occurs when two slightly different frequencies are played, and the brain perceives the difference between them as a rhythmic pulse."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a client experiencing acute lower back tension. According to the protocol for Weighted Tuning Forks (like the Otto 128Hz), where should the stem be placed?",
            "options": [
                "Six inches above the site of pain in the biofield",
                "Directly on a bony prominence or trigger point near the area",
                "Held against the practitioner's own sternum to project the sound",
                "Tapped against the client's ear for auditory entrainment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weighted forks are designed for vibroacoustic transfer; placing the stem on a bony prominence allows the vibration to travel through the skeletal system to the targeted tissue."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "What is the 'Golden Rule' of Gong dynamics to ensure a safe and therapeutic experience for the client?",
            "options": [
                "Always play at maximum volume to ensure 'breaking' the ego",
                "Use only hard mallets for the duration of the session",
                "Avoid the 'Wall of Sound' peak unless the client is prepared and it is therapeutically indicated",
                "Keep the gong perfectly still during the entire application"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Wall of Sound' can be overwhelming or triggering; practitioners must build volume gradually and observe the client's physiological responses to ensure they remain in a state of relaxation rather than fight-or-flight."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which percussion instrument is most commonly used for 'clearing' or 'breaking up' stagnant energy in the biofield due to its high-frequency, sharp transients?",
            "options": [
                "The Buffalo Drum",
                "The Ocean Drum",
                "The Shamanic Rattle",
                "The Weighted Tuning Fork"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rattles produce a broad spectrum of high-frequency transients which are traditionally and clinically used to disrupt stagnant patterns and clear the energetic field."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "To prevent Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and repetitive strain, how should a practitioner hold a mallet when playing a large gong?",
            "options": [
                "With a 'death grip' to ensure the mallet doesn't fly out of the hand",
                "Using a fulcrum point with a relaxed grip, allowing the mallet's weight to do the work",
                "Keeping the wrist completely locked and moving only from the shoulder",
                "Holding the mallet at the very tip of the handle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ergonomics (Lesson 7) emphasizes a relaxed grip and using the mallet's momentum to prevent the transfer of impact shock into the practitioner's joints."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the 'Sonic Layering' technique, why is it recommended to introduce a new instrument before the previous one has completely faded to silence?",
            "options": [
                "To hide the fact that the practitioner is switching tools",
                "To maintain the 'Sonic Continuity' and prevent the client from 'dropping out' of the altered state",
                "To save time and shorten the session length",
                "To create dissonance that wakes the client up"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Layering prevents 'dead air' which can cause the client's analytical mind to reactivate, thereby maintaining the deep state of entrainment achieved during the session."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A 2016 study on Himalayan Singing Bowl meditation found significant reductions in which physiological marker?",
            "options": [
                "Blood glucose levels",
                "Systolic blood pressure and heart rate",
                "Bone density",
                "Visual acuity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical research cited in the module shows that sound application significantly impacts the autonomic nervous system, leading to lower blood pressure and heart rate."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended sequence for a 'Full Body Sonic Integration' session?",
            "options": [
                "High-frequency activation -> Grounding -> Clearing",
                "Clearing -> High-frequency activation -> Grounding",
                "Grounding -> Clearing -> High-frequency activation -> Final Grounding",
                "The order does not matter as long as the instruments are loud"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective sequencing (Lesson 8) follows a logical arc: grounding the client first, clearing the field, activating higher states, and then grounding again to ensure the client is stable before leaving."
