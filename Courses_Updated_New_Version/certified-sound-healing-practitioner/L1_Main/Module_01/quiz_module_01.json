            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the process where a stronger rhythmic vibration influences a weaker one to lock into its frequency, a foundational concept in sound healing."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the anatomy of the human biofield, which layer is located closest to the physical body (approx. 1-2 inches) and serves as the 'template' or 'blueprint' for physical health?",

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "During a sensory observation (L3), a practitioner notes a client's 'shallow clavicular breathing' and 'guarded cervical posture.' These somatic markers are most indicative of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shallow breathing and guarded posture are classic somatic markers of a 'fight or flight' (sympathetic) state, indicating a need for grounding frequencies."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Bio-Acoustic Assessment (L4) utilizes the analysis of the human voice. What is the significance of 'missing notes' or weak frequencies in a client's vocal spectrum?",
            "options": [
                "They indicate the client is not a good singer",
                "They represent potential energetic 'voids' or disharmony in specific physiological or emotional systems",
                "They suggest the practitioner's equipment is faulty",
                "They are irrelevant to the assessment process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Missing vocal frequencies are often correlated with specific areas of the body or emotional states that are under-active or blocked."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "During the Resonance Intake Process (L5), why is it critical to identify a client's 'Sound Triggers' (sounds they dislike)?",
            "options": [
                "To play those sounds during the session to 'toughen' them up",
                "To ensure the practitioner avoids those frequencies/timbres to prevent a sympathetic 'recoil' response",
                "To determine the client's musical taste for playlist creation",
                "To diagnose clinical hearing loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying triggers prevents the practitioner from accidentally inducing a stress response (recoil) during the healing session."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which term describes the phenomenon where a silent tuning fork begins to vibrate when a second tuning fork of the exact same frequency is struck nearby?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sympathetic resonance occurs when a passive object vibrates in response to a external vibration of its own natural frequency."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "In Advanced Assessment (L7), when using Manual Muscle Testing (Kinesiology), a 'strong' muscle response while the client is exposed to a specific sound frequency generally indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The frequency is causing bio-stress",
                "The frequency is 'biocompatible' or resonant with the client's current needs",
                "The client is resisting the treatment",
                "The frequency is too loud"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A strong or 'locked' muscle response indicates that the stimulus (frequency) is supportive of the client's energetic integrity."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "When synthesizing the Resonance Profile (L8), a practitioner identifies a 'Dissonant Pattern.' This is best defined as:",
            "options": [
                "A beautiful, harmonious chord",
                "A clash of frequencies that creates tension, often mirroring internal conflict or physiological stress",
                "The client's favorite song",
                "A state of perfect health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissonance in the resonance profile represents areas of 'interference' or tension that require balancing through harmonic intervention."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'vocal fry' (a low, scratchy, compressed voice) and reports feeling 'stagnant and ungrounded.' Which assessment synthesis is most likely?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive resonance in the higher chakras",
                "A 'Grounding Deficiency' with somatic markers of lower-frequency depletion",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vocal fry and feelings of stagnation often correlate with a lack of 'root' or grounding resonance in the lower end of the spectrum."
