            "question": "According to the physics of harmonic overtones, if the fundamental frequency of a singing bowl is 200Hz, what is the frequency of the third harmonic (the second overtone)?",
            "options": [
                "400Hz",
                "600Hz",
                "800Hz",
                "1000Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The harmonic series follows integer multiples of the fundamental. If the fundamental (1st harmonic) is 200Hz, the 2nd is 400Hz, and the 3rd harmonic is 600Hz (200 x 3)."

            "question": "When mapping energetic pathways, a practitioner identifies a 'sonic void' or 'dead spot' in the client's biofield. What does this typically indicate in Sound Healing theory?",
            "options": [
                "An area of excessive energy flow",
                "A healthy, receptive channel",
                "A blockage or 'frozen' energy where sound is being absorbed rather than reflected",
                "The presence of high-frequency spiritual connection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In biofield mapping, areas that 'swallow' sound or cause rapid decay are interpreted as energetic blockages or density that prevents the natural resonance of the field."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "The 'Perfect Fifth' interval (3:2 ratio) is critical in the 'Opening' phase because it has been scientifically shown to trigger the release of which molecule within 30 seconds?",
            "options": [
                "Nitric Oxide (NO)",
                "Cortisol",
                "Adrenaline",
                "Thyroxine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research, specifically by Dr. John Beaulieu, shows that the 3:2 ratio (Perfect Fifth) stimulates the puffing of Nitric Oxide in the cells, which signals the nervous system to relax and opens vascular channels."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In the clearing of the Sushumna (Central Pillar), which sonic technique is most effective for 'vertical alignment'?",
            "options": [
                "Randomly striking gongs at high volume",
                "Sweeping a tuning fork from the root to the crown in a steady, rhythmic motion",
                "Using only silent meditation",
                "Focusing sound only on the hands and feet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clearing the Sushumna requires a 'Sonic Sweep'—moving a consistent frequency along the vertical axis of the body to encourage the upward flow of energy (Prana/Kundalini)."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Vocal toning uses 'Internal Channel Activation.' Which vowel sound is traditionally used to resonate and open the chest and heart center?",
            "options": [
                "The 'U' (OO) sound",
                "The 'E' (EE) sound",
                "The 'A' (AH) sound",
                "The 'M' (MMM) sound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In vocal resonance therapy, the 'AH' sound is physiologically linked to the expansion of the ribcage and the opening of the heart (Anahata) region."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the Vagus nerve is the 'Gateway to Healing' that sound practitioners aim to activate during the Opening phase?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal complex (Freeze response)",
                "The Sympathetic Chain (Fight or Flight)",
                "The Ventral Vagal complex (Social Engagement/Safety)",
                "The Sciatic nerve path"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal complex is responsible for the 'rest and digest' state and social engagement. Sound healing aims to activate this branch to move the client out of survival mode."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "During Sonic Preparation, a 2022 study mentioned in the lesson found that 10 minutes of harmonic entrainment increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV) by what average range?",
            "options": [
                "2-5%",
                "15-20%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistent harmonic preparation has been shown to increase HRV by 15-20%, indicating a significant improvement in the body's ability to handle stress and enter a receptive state."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Transition Phase' (Lesson 8) when moving from Opening to Neutralizing?",
            "options": [
                "To shock the client into a higher state of consciousness",
                "To allow the cellular 'puffing' of Nitric Oxide to stabilize before introducing corrective frequencies",
                "To end the session as quickly as possible",
                "To increase the volume to its maximum level"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition phase ensures the client's system has fully integrated the 'opening' stimulus (relaxation) before the practitioner begins the more targeted work of 'neutralizing' specific imbalances."

            "id": "q4_9",

                "Vocal toning focused on the throat (Vishuddha) using the 'EE' sound",
                "Heavy drumming near the feet",

                "Using high-pitched crystal pyramids only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vocal toning (internal activation) at the throat center is a specific 'Opening' protocol for blockages related to expression and communication."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "The 'Auricular Gateway' refers to stimulating the Vagus nerve through which specific anatomical location?",
            "options": [
                "The soles of the feet",
                "The concha and external auditory canal of the ear",

                "The palms of the hands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The auricular branch of the Vagus nerve is the only peripheral branch that surfaces at the skin, specifically in the external ear, making it a direct 'gateway' for sound stimulation."
