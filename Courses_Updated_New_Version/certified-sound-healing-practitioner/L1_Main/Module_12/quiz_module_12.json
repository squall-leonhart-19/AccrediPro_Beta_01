            "question": "In the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. Method™, what does the 'E' represent, and what is its primary physiological function in a sound healing session?",
            "options": [
                "Equilibrium; balancing the left and right hemispheres of the brain.",
                "Entrainment; synchronizing biological rhythms to an external rhythmic stimulus.",
                "Evolution; the long-term shift in a client's DNA resonance.",
                "Energy; the total wattage produced by singing bowls in a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the process where two vibrating bodies lock into phase. In sound healing, it is used to synchronize heart rate, breath, and brainwaves to the therapeutic frequencies of the instruments."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "During a Bio-Acoustic Field assessment (Lesson 2), a practitioner moves a tuning fork through the field and hears a sudden 'dip' or 'thinning' of the sound. What does this typically indicate in the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. framework?",
            "options": [
                "A localized area of energy depletion or 'leakage' in the bio-field.",
                "The client has reached a state of deep Samadhi.",
                "The tuning fork is losing its vibration and needs to be struck again.",
                "A zone of high-frequency over-activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A thinning or 'hollow' sound during assessment often indicates an area where the bio-acoustic field is weak or depleted, requiring targeted resonance to restore integrity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Which historical figure's observations on 'sympathy' between pendulum clocks serve as the scientific foundation for the Entrainment Strategy discussed in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "Nikola Tesla",
                "Pythagoras of Samos",
                "Christian Huygens",
                "Hans Jenny"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Christian Huygens observed in 1665 that two pendulum clocks mounted on the same beam would eventually swing in perfect synchrony, a phenomenon now known as entrainment."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When applying 'Precision Instrument Techniques' (Lesson 4), what is the primary benefit of using weighted tuning forks directly on bony landmarks?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the sound louder for the practitioner.",
                "It creates a visual vibration in the skin for the client to see.",
                "It utilizes bone conduction to deliver vibration directly to the nervous system and cellular structure.",
                "It prevents the fork from losing its pitch over time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Weighted forks are designed for tactile application; bone conduction allows the frequency to bypass the air-conduction auditory system and reach deep tissues and the nervous system directly."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 focuses on 'Opening Channels.' Why are harmonic overtones considered essential for bypassing the 'analytical mind' during a session?",
            "options": [
                "Overtones are too quiet for the conscious mind to hear.",
                "The complexity of the harmonic series provides 'super-sensory' input that encourages the brain to shift from Beta to Alpha/Theta states.",
                "Overtones physically block the ear canal.",
                "Overtones only exist in the practitioner's imagination."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The rich, multi-layered nature of overtones provides a complex stimulus that the analytical mind cannot easily categorize, facilitating a shift into deeper, non-linear states of consciousness."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In 'Neutralizing Dissonance' (Lesson 6), what is the 'Resolution Technique' used to clear energetic stagnation?",
            "options": [
                "Playing only high-pitched sounds until the client feels energized.",
                "Using a 'tension-and-release' cycle by introducing a dissonant interval and then resolving it to a consonant interval (like a perfect fifth).",
                "Maintaining absolute silence for 20 minutes.",
                "Striking a gong as loudly as possible to 'shatter' the dissonance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The tension-release cycle mirrors the natural process of emotional processing, allowing the nervous system to encounter 'stuck' energy (dissonance) and then find a pathway to release (consonance)."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Internal Coherence.' According to the module, a state of high coherence is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "A rapid, erratic heartbeat.",
                "An increase in cortisol and adrenaline.",
                "A smooth, sine-wave-like pattern in Heart Rate Variability (HRV).",
                "The complete cessation of brainwave activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internal coherence, specifically heart-brain coherence, is marked by an ordered, rhythmic HRV pattern, which indicates a state of physiological efficiency and emotional stability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "During the 'Embodied Integration' phase (Lesson 8), why is the use of lower-frequency instruments (like large gongs or ground-rooted drums) recommended?",
            "options": [
                "To startle the client awake.",
                "To provide low-frequency tactile input that signals the body to 'return' to physical awareness and ground the energetic shifts.",
                "Because low frequencies are easier for the practitioner to play while tired.",
                "To mask any outside noise during the end of the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths that are felt more physically in the body, helping the client integrate their 'ethereal' or meditative experience back into their physical form."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Hyper-Arousal' (anxiety/tachycardia). Which R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. sequence would be most appropriate based on the Module 12 protocols?",
            "options": [
                "High-pitched bells followed by rapid drumming.",
                "Loud, dissonant gongs followed by silence.",
                "Deep, steady entrainment to 60 BPM followed by harmonic vocal toning for alignment.",
                "Immediate application of weighted forks to the forehead without warm-up."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For hyper-arousal, the priority is to entrain the heart rate downward to a resting state (60 BPM) and then use harmonic alignment to stabilize the nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'ASI Credential Strip' standards mentioned in the module regarding practitioner ethics?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner uses the most expensive bowls available.",
                "To verify that the practitioner follows a standardized, evidence-based protocol for client safety and efficacy.",
                "To provide a decorative border for session notes.",
                "To track the number of clients a practitioner sees per week."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ASI standards ensure that practitioners are utilizing sound healing as a professional, evidence-based modality with consistent results and safety protocols."
