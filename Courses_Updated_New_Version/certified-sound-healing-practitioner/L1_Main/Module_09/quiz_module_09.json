            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Resonance Assessment (R) phase focuses on scanning the client's biofield to detect energetic 'noise,' resistance, or disharmony before any treatment begins."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Overtones and the harmonic series help 'open' the client's field by providing complex sonic information that bypasses linear thinking and prepares the system for deeper transformation."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "When 'Neutralizing Dissonance' (N) in Lesson 6, which interval is most effective for breaking up 'stuck' or traumatic energy before resolving it?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dissonant intervals like the Tritone or Minor Second are used strategically to 'agitate' and break up stagnant energy patterns, which are then resolved into consonant intervals."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 (Alignment and Transformation), at what frequency does the human heart typically achieve 'Resonant Frequency' for maximum Heart Rate Variability (HRV) coherence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective entrainment requires 'meeting the client where they are' (matching their current frequency/tempo) before leading them toward the desired slower state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
