            "question": "In the RESONATE Method™, how is 'Alignment' fundamentally distinguished from 'Relaxation'?",
            "options": [
                "Relaxation is a passive state of low tension, while Alignment is an active state of structural and energetic coherence.",
                "Alignment refers only to the physical posture, whereas relaxation refers to the mental state.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in sound therapy.",
                "Relaxation requires sound, while Alignment is achieved only through silent meditation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In Lesson 1, Alignment is defined as a dynamic, active state where the client's systems are synchronized and coherent, moving beyond the mere absence of tension (relaxation)."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A client experiences a release of physical tension but still feels 'spiritually disconnected.' According to the Multi-Dimensional Alignment model (Lesson 3), which layer is likely missing coherence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multi-dimensional alignment requires all layers (Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual) to be in sync; a lack of connection despite physical release suggests an Ethereal/Spiritual misalignment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vocal toning, particularly humming, creates internal vibrations that stimulate the vagus nerve and provide a 'massage' to the internal organs, fostering parasympathetic alignment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An involuntary deep breath or sigh is a classic sign of the 'Alignment Shift,' indicating the body has moved from a sympathetic (stress) state to a parasympathetic (recovery) state."
