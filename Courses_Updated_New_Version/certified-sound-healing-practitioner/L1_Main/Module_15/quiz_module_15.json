            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Resonance Assessment' (R) phase in the R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. Method™?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately begin healing the client's physical ailments",
                "To map the client's biofield and identify areas of 'sonic shadows' or density",
                "To select the loudest instrument available for the session",
                "To explain the history of sound healing to the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' phase is about assessment and mapping; it involves scanning the biofield to find 'sonic shadows' (areas of dissonance or density) before intervention begins."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to the physics of 'Entrainment Strategy' (E), what occurs during 'Mutual Phase-Locking'?",
            "options": [
                "Two independent oscillators continue to vibrate at different frequencies",
                "The practitioner's frequency is lowered to match the client's stressed state",
                "The weaker rhythmic system synchronizes its frequency with the stronger one",
                "Sound waves cancel each other out, creating complete silence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mutual Phase-Locking is the process where a stronger rhythmic influence (the instrument) causes a weaker system (the client's nervous system) to synchronize with its frequency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In the 'Sonic Application' (S) phase, why is the 'Perfect Fifth' (3:2 ratio) considered a 'Gold Standard' for precision?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only interval that can be heard by the human ear",
                "It creates a specific mathematical dissonance that causes physical pain",
                "It stimulates the release of nitric oxide and induces rapid cellular relaxation",
                "It is used exclusively for grounding the client at the end of a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 3:2 ratio (Perfect Fifth) is scientifically recognized for its ability to stimulate nitric oxide release in the body, which facilitates vasodilation and deep relaxation."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "During the 'Opening Channels' (O) phase, how do harmonic overtones facilitate a shift in consciousness?",
            "options": [
                "By masking the primary fundamental frequency entirely",
                "By providing a 'complex sonic ladder' that allows the brain to transition from Beta to Alpha/Theta states",
                "By creating a single, monotonous tone that induces sleep",
                "By vibrating the physical bones of the skull to clear the sinuses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Harmonic overtones create a complex soundscape that provides the brain with multiple points of resonance, facilitating a faster transition into meditative Alpha and Theta brainwave states."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of sound therapy protocols (n=2,450) cited in the module suggests that 'Neutralizing Dissonance' (N) is most effective when:",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner ignores the dissonance and plays only pleasant sounds",
                "Dissonant intervals are used briefly to 'break up' stagnation before resolving into consonance",
                "The session is performed in total darkness",
                "Only high-pitched crystal bowls are used for the entire duration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'N' phase uses controlled dissonance (like the tritone) to meet the client's internal state, 'breaking up' stagnant patterns before moving back into a harmonious, resonant state."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the 'Alignment' (A) phase, what specific physiological marker indicates that a 'Shift' has successfully occurred?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in the client's body temperature by 5 degrees",
                "A sudden increase in the client's heart rate",
                "An increase in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) coherence levels",
                "The client's ability to hold their breath for over two minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV coherence is a primary metric for physiological alignment and 'The Shift,' indicating that the heart, lungs, and brain are working in rhythmic harmony."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "The 'Transformation' (T) phase focuses on 'Coherent Integration.' What does this mean for the client's biofield?",
            "options": [
                "The biofield becomes smaller and more compressed",
                "The biofield's frequency patterns become more organized, stable, and resilient",
                "The biofield is completely removed and replaced",
                "The biofield begins to vibrate at a frequency higher than the human range"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transformation is about establishing a new, coherent baseline where the biofield is more organized and better able to resist external stressors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "In 'Embodied Integration' (E), why is grounding the client considered a 'non-negotiable' step?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent 'frequency drift' and ensure the client can safely operate a vehicle after the session",
                "Because the practitioner needs to charge the client for the extra time",
                "To ensure the client remains in a trance state for as long as possible",
                "To increase the high-frequency vibration of the client's crown chakra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Grounding (Integration) is essential to bring the client back to a functional, embodied state, ensuring the benefits of the session are 'locked in' and the client is safe to resume daily activities."

            "question": "In the Case Study of 'Sarah' (age 42, chronic anxiety), which R.E.S.O.N.A.T.E. step was highlighted as the turning point for her 'frozen' nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "The Assessment (R) phase where she felt 'heard' for the first time",
                "The Neutralizing (N) phase, where the use of the Tritone released a 'knot' in her solar plexus",
                "The Opening (O) phase, where she fell asleep immediately",
                "The Integration (E) phase, where she performed a 5-minute chanting exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As detailed in the module case study, the 'Neutralizing' phase using strategic dissonance was the catalyst for Sarah releasing the long-held physical tension associated with her anxiety."
