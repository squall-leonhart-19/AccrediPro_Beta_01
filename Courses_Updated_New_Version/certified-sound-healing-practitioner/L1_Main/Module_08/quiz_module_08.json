            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Embodied Integration' phase in the sound healing process?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the volume of sound during the session",
                "To bridge the gap between the therapeutic experience and the client's daily physiological and cognitive reality",
                "To ensure the client falls into a deep sleep during the treatment",
                "To sell additional instruments to the client for home use"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Embodied Integration is the crucial phase where the insights and physiological shifts achieved during a session are anchored into the client's nervous system and daily habits."

            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Somatic Grounding), which specific frequency is most commonly used with weighted tuning forks on the body's 'earth' points to facilitate physical anchoring?",
            "options": [
                "528 Hz",
                "432 Hz",
                "128 Hz (Otto Tuner)",
                "963 Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 128 Hz Otto Tuner is a standard for somatic grounding because its lower frequency and weighted vibration are highly effective at stimulating mechanoreceptors and anchoring the client in their physical body."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to the Physiological Recovery protocols in Lesson 3, what is the 'Critical Window' for metabolic clearance and neural settling post-session?",
            "options": [
                "30 minutes",
                "2 to 4 hours",
                "24 to 48 hours",
                "Exactly 7 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 24 to 48-hour window is critical for the body to process the 'healing crisis' or detox effect and for the autonomic nervous system to stabilize in its new state."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 4 regarding Sonic Micro-Practices indicates that humming can increase nasal Nitric Oxide (NO) levels by how much compared to quiet breathing?",
            "options": [
                "2 times",
                "5 times",
                "15 times",
                "50 times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Weitzberg & Lundberg, 2002) have shown that humming increases nasal nitric oxide by 15-fold, which significantly improves gas exchange and induces a relaxation response."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "In the context of Cognitive Processing (Lesson 5), what is 'Reflective Inquiry' designed to prevent?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Fade-Out Effect' where session insights are lost to daily stressors",
                "Physical pain in the ears",
                "The client from talking during the session",
                "Excessive hydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reflective Inquiry helps the client conceptualize and verbalize their experience, which strengthens the neural pathways and prevents the benefits of the session from fading when they return to a stressful environment."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "When designing 'Environmental Harmonics' (Lesson 6), what is the recommended decibel (dB) limit for a 'Sonic Sanctuary' to maintain a parasympathetic state?",
            "options": [
                "Below 35 dB",
                "Between 50 and 60 dB",
                "Exactly 70 dB",
                "Decibel levels do not matter as long as there is music"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A restorative environment should ideally remain below 35 dB (comparable to a quiet library) to avoid triggering the 'startle response' or low-level sympathetic arousal."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "The Practitioner’s Follow-Up Framework (Lesson 7) recommends the first 'Integration Check-In' occur at what interval?",

                "1 hour after the session",
                "48 to 72 hours after the session",
                "2 weeks later",
                "Only if the client reaches out first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 48-72 hour mark is the 'sweet spot' for a follow-up, as it allows the initial processing window to close while the experience is still fresh enough for meaningful integration support."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "According to the Long-Term Wellness Blueprint (Lesson 8), what is the 'Maintenance Frequency' for a client who has reached their therapeutic goals but wants to prevent regression?",
            "options": [
                "Twice daily",
                "Once a week",
                "Every 4 to 6 weeks",
                "Once a year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For maintenance of a regulated nervous system, a professional 'tune-up' session every 4 to 6 weeks is generally recommended to address accumulated lifestyle stress."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'disoriented and lightheaded' immediately following a session with high-pitched gongs. Which integration protocol should you apply immediately?",
            "options": [
                "Play more high-pitched instruments to 'clear' the energy",
                "Provide a glass of structured water and apply weighted forks to the K1 (Kidney 1) points on the feet",
                "Ask the client to leave immediately to get some fresh air",
                "Tell the client to ignore the feeling as it is purely psychological"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lightheadedness indicates a lack of grounding. Hydration and tactile, low-frequency stimulation (like weighted forks on K1) are the standard protocols for re-orienting a client to their body."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Which concept from Lesson 1 describes the body's ability to maintain stable internal conditions despite external 'sonic' changes?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sonic Homeostasis refers to the body's internal self-regulation and its ability to return to a balanced state after being influenced by therapeutic sound frequencies."
