            "question": "In the context of the physics of entrainment, what is the 'Frequency Following Response' (FFR)?",
            "options": [
                "The tendency of a biological system to resist external frequencies",
                "The phenomenon where the brain's electrical activity aligns with the frequency of an external auditory stimulus",
                "A state where two objects vibrate at different frequencies without interaction",
                "The process of sound waves reflecting off hard surfaces in a healing room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Frequency Following Response (FFR) is the mechanism by which the brain's internal rhythms (EEG) synchronize with the periodic rhythm of an external stimulus."

            "question": "Christian Huygens, who first observed entrainment in 1665, noted that two pendulum clocks on the same wall would eventually synchronize. What is the primary requirement for this to occur?",
            "options": [
                "The clocks must be made of the same material",
                "The clocks must be wound at exactly the same time",
                "There must be a medium for energy exchange (coupling) between the two oscillators",
                "The room must be completely silent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entrainment requires 'coupling,' or a way for energy to be exchanged between oscillators, such as the vibrations traveling through the common wooden beam in Huygens' experiment."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which brainwave state, typically ranging from 4 Hz to 8 Hz, is the primary target for deep meditation, creative insight, and the hypnagogic state?",
            "options": [
                "Beta",
                "Alpha",
                "Theta",
                "Gamma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta waves (4-8 Hz) are associated with deep relaxation, dreaming, and the 'twilight' state between wakefulness and sleep, making it a key target for sound practitioners."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to the Law of Sympathetic Resonance, what happens when a vibrating tuning fork is brought near a stationary tuning fork of the exact same frequency?",
            "options": [
                "The stationary fork begins to vibrate without being touched",
                "The vibrating fork immediately stops",
                "Both forks cancel each other out, creating silence",
                "The stationary fork vibrates at half the original frequency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sympathetic resonance occurs when a passive object begins to vibrate because it shares the same natural frequency as a nearby active vibration source."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a client who is highly agitated and anxious (High Beta). Using the ISO Principle, what is the first step the practitioner should take?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately play slow, low-frequency Delta tones to force relaxation",
                "Begin with music or rhythms that match the client's current high-energy, agitated state",
                "Ask the client to remain silent for 10 minutes",
                "Play a wide variety of frequencies to see which one 'sticks'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ISO Principle requires 'matching' the client's current physiological or emotional state first before 'leading' them toward a desired state."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In rhythmic entrainment, what does a 'high' Heart Rate Variability (HRV) typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A state of chronic stress and sympathetic dominance",
                "A healthy, flexible autonomic nervous system and parasympathetic activation",
                "An impending cardiovascular event",
                "That the client is not responding to the sound therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV is a marker of resilience and a healthy balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, often achieved through rhythmic entrainment."

            "question": "When designing a 'Frequency Ramp' for a sonic journey intended for deep sleep, which direction should the frequencies move?",
            "options": [
                "From 4 Hz up to 40 Hz (Ascending)",
                "From 15 Hz down to 2 Hz (Descending)",
                "Maintaining a steady 60 Hz throughout",
                "Alternating rapidly between 5 Hz and 50 Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To lead a client into sleep, a descending ramp is used to move the brain from active Beta/Alpha states down into the Delta range (0.5-4 Hz)."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Why is 60 beats per minute (BPM) considered a 'foundational' tempo in biological pacing for sound healing?",
            "options": [
                "It is the frequency of the Earth's electromagnetic field",
                "It correlates with a relaxed human resting heart rate, aiding in physiological stabilization",
                "It is the highest frequency the human ear can detect",
                "It represents the Golden Ratio in musical form"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A tempo of 60 BPM (1 Hz) matches a healthy resting heart rate, making it an ideal 'anchor' for entraining the cardiovascular system toward relaxation."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'soft' clinical indicator that a client has successfully entrained to a lower, parasympathetic state?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, shallow chest breathing",
                "Involuntary muscle twitching or deep, spontaneous sighing",
                "Increased eye movement (REM) while awake",
                "The client asking questions during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep sighs, swallowing, and involuntary 'releases' are common physiological indicators that the nervous system has shifted from sympathetic (fight/flight) to parasympathetic (rest/digest)."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Resonance' and 'Entrainment' in sound therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Resonance is about matching frequencies; Entrainment is about the active change of a rhythm over time",
                "Resonance only happens with metal; Entrainment only happens with water",
                "Resonance is a psychological state; Entrainment is a physical state",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Resonance is the 'vibratory sympathy' between two objects, while entrainment is the active process where a stronger rhythm influences a weaker one to change its period to match."
