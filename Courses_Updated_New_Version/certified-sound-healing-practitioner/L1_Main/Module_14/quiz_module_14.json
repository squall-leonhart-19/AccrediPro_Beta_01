            "question": "During a Resonance Assessment (L1), what does a 'flat' or 'dull' auditory response when scanning the bio-acoustic field typically signify?",
            "options": [
                "An area of high energetic flow and vitality",
                "A region of stagnant, dense, or depleted energy",
                "The presence of harmonic overtones",
                "A state of perfect internal coherence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In bio-acoustic mapping, a dull or flat sound indicates that the field is not vibrating freely, often due to energetic stagnation or physical depletion in that specific area."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Which biological phenomenon explains why a client's brainwaves will eventually match the rhythm of a consistent 4Hz binaural beat or steady drumbeat?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Resonance",
                "Frequency Following Response (FFR)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Frequency Following Response (FFR) is the process where the brain synchronizes its internal electrical cycles to the frequency of an external rhythmic stimulus."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "When using weighted tuning forks for 'Sonic Application' (L3), why is direct contact with bony prominences preferred for deep integration?",
            "options": [
                "Bone conduction transmits vibration 12 times faster than air",
                "Bones act as insulators to stop the sound from spreading",
                "It prevents the client from hearing the sound",
                "Weighted forks cannot be used in the bio-field"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bone conduction is highly efficient; sound travels significantly faster and more clearly through the dense structure of bone than through the air or soft tissue."

                "To lower the decibel level of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Harmonic overtones create a rich, complex soundscape that the analytical brain cannot easily 'solve,' allowing the client to drop into a more receptive, meditative state."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "In the 'Neutralizing Dissonance' phase (L5), how is a 'dissonant' interval (like a tritone) strategically used by a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "To soothe the client into a deep sleep",
                "To break up 'stuck' patterns by creating a controlled energetic 'shattering' effect",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissonance creates tension; in a therapeutic context, controlled dissonance is used to 'break up' the static or stagnant patterns before resolving them into consonance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A smooth, rhythmic HRV pattern indicates a state of 'coherence' where the nervous system is balanced and the heart and brain are in sync."

                "Using high-frequency bells immediately after deep work",
                "Grounding the energy through physical touch, weighted tools, or focused breathwork",
                "Asking the client to leave immediately to process the work alone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration requires grounding the energetic shifts back into the physical body to prevent a 'healing crisis' and to make the wellness benefits lasting."

            "id": "q14_9",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In many bio-field models, information further from the body represents the 'past,' while information closer to the body represents the 'present' or physical state."
