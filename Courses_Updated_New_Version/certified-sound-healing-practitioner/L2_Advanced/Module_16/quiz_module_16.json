            "question": "When working with Complex Trauma (CPTSD), why is 'titration' of sound intensity considered a core safety requirement in the Somatic Biofield approach?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client reaches a state of deep sleep within the first 10 minutes.",
                "To prevent 'flooding' the nervous system, which can trigger dissociation or a flashback.",
                "To maximize the volume of the root chakra frequencies for grounding.",
                "To bypass the prefrontal cortex and go straight to the amygdala."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves introducing sound in small, manageable 'doses' to keep the client within their 'Window of Tolerance,' preventing the nervous system from becoming overwhelmed and triggering a trauma response."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the treatment of Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain, a 2019 clinical review highlighted that low-frequency vibroacoustic therapy (VAT) at which frequency was most effective for reducing pain scores?",

                "528 Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research, including studies by Naghdi et al., has shown that 40 Hz vibroacoustic stimulation is particularly effective for fibromyalgia, as it helps disrupt the 'pain-spasm-pain' cycle and addresses central sensitization."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "For clients with Neurodegenerative Disorders like Alzheimer's, what is the primary goal of utilizing 40Hz Gamma entrainment?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies from MIT have demonstrated that 40Hz auditory and visual stimulation can trigger microglia (the brain's immune cells) to clear amyloid-beta plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sound—specifically low-frequency humming or targeted bowls—can stimulate the Vagus nerve, activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway which inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

                "Playing loud, rhythmic drums to keep the patient conscious as long as possible."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Iso-principle involves meeting the patient where they are emotionally or physiologically (e.g., matching an agitated heart rate or breathing) and then slowly guiding them toward a state of peace and relaxation."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the context of Elite Performance, Sound Healing is used to improve 'Super-compensation' by focusing on which specific metric?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sound healing, particularly Alpha-Theta entrainment, is used to increase Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a key indicator of autonomic nervous system balance and the body's readiness to recover and perform."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency sound work helps stabilize the nervous system and manage the 'reward deficiency' often found in addiction, helping to regulate dopamine and reduce the physiological intensity of cravings."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A case study involving an athlete in Module 16 showed that a 20-minute post-training sound session resulted in what average increase in parasympathetic dominance (via HRV)?",

                "2-5%",
                "15-22%",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced case studies in athletic recovery typically show a 15-22% improvement in HRV markers, indicating a significant shift from 'fight or flight' to 'rest and digest' after a targeted sonic intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Signs of hyper-arousal (rapid breathing, sweating, or agitation) indicate the client is moving out of their Window of Tolerance. The practitioner should immediately ground the client, reduce volume, or stop the sound."
