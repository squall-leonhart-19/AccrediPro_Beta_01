            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sound healing practitioners are not licensed medical professionals; diagnosing specific physiological diseases is outside their scope of practice and can lead to legal and safety risks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care requires 'titration'—slowing down the process and providing a safe container for grounding rather than overwhelming the nervous system further."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
