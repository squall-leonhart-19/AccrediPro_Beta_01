            "question": "During a session, a client experiences an acute emotional catharsis involving intense, uncontrollable sobbing. According to the 'Hold, Ground, Resonate' protocol, what is your first action?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop all sound to allow for silence",
                "Increase the volume of the instruments to mask the crying",
                "Maintain a steady, low-frequency 'anchor' tone and offer a grounding verbal cue",
                "Guide the client into a vigorous breathing exercise to process the emotion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Abruptly stopping sound can leave a client feeling 'exposed' or abandoned in their vulnerability. Maintaining a steady, low-frequency anchor provides a containment field while grounding cues help them stay present in the body."

            "question": "When working with a client on the Autism Spectrum (ASD) who has high sensory processing sensitivity, which instrument choice is most likely to cause sensory overload?",
            "options": [
                "A deep, frosted 14-inch G2 Quartz Crystal Bowl played at high friction",
                "A handheld buffalo drum played with a soft mallet",
                "A weighted 128Hz Otto Tuner applied to the feet",
                "A set of Koshi chimes played at a distance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-intensity, high-friction crystal bowls produce complex overtones and high-decibel piercing frequencies that can be painful or overwhelming for neurodivergent individuals with auditory hypersensitivity."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In palliative care and end-of-life transitions, what is the primary objective of 'Sonic Midwifery' during the active dying phase?",
            "options": [
                "To attempt to wake the patient for a final conversation",
                "To provide an entrainment frequency that matches the patient's slowing heart rate to induce calm",
                "To play complex rhythmic patterns to stimulate brain activity",
                "To use 528Hz specifically for physical cellular regeneration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In end-of-life care, sound is used to mirror the physiological slowing of the body (iso-principle), helping to reduce terminal agitation and create a peaceful environment for the transition."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "What is the industry-standard safety protocol for using vibrating instruments (like tuning forks or Himalayan bowls) near a client with a cardiac pacemaker?",
            "options": [
                "Avoid all sound healing entirely as sound waves disrupt electronics",
                "Maintain a minimum distance of 12 inches (30cm) from the device to avoid magnetic interference",
                "Only use aluminum forks, as steel forks are the only ones that interfere",
                "There are no restrictions as sound waves are mechanical, not electromagnetic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While sound is mechanical, the magnets in certain instruments or the electromagnetic fields generated by some electronic sound equipment can interfere with a pacemaker's settings. A 12-inch safety buffer is the standard precaution."

            "question": "A client with Complex PTSD (CPTSD) enters a state of 'hypoarousal' during a session. Which set of symptoms would you observe?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid breathing, shaking, and hyper-vigilance",
                "Numbness, dissociation, and a 'flat' emotional affect",
                "Anger, verbal outbursts, and increased muscle tension",
                "Laughter, euphoria, and rapid eye movement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypoarousal is the 'freeze' or 'shut down' response. It is characterized by a drop in heart rate, emotional numbing, and dissociation, requiring gentle, grounding, and slightly more 'waking' sounds to bring them back into the window of tolerance."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "High-performance executives suffering from 'Decision Fatigue' and chronic burnout typically show an overactive HPA axis. Which sound protocol is most effective for resetting this system?",
            "options": [
                "High-frequency binaural beats (Gamma) for 30 minutes",
                "Irregular, unpredictable gong strikes to 'break' mental loops",
                "Predictable, low-frequency intervals (Perfect 5ths) to stimulate the Vagus nerve",
                "Loud, percussive drumming to release pent-up aggression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Predictability and harmonic intervals like the Perfect 5th signal safety to the nervous system, encouraging a shift from Sympathetic (fight/flight) to Parasympathetic (rest/digest) dominance."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "During a group sound bath, one participant begins to loudly 'over-tone' or chant in a way that disrupts the experience for others. What is the most professional 'Trauma-Informed' response?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the session and ask the person to leave",
                "Incorporate their sound into the landscape briefly, then use a 'hushing' gesture or a direct, soft verbal request for silence",
                "Ignore it and play your instruments louder to drown them out",
                "Publicly explain to the group why that person's behavior is energetic interference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal is to preserve the 'container' for the group without shaming the individual. Validating the sound briefly before gently guiding the group back to silence is the most effective management strategy."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "When working in an integrative care setting with a clinical psychotherapist, what is the Sound Practitioner's primary boundary regarding client 'processing'?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner should provide deep psychological analysis of the client's visions",
                "The practitioner should diagnose the client with specific DSM-5 disorders",
                "The practitioner facilitates the somatic experience and refers all psychological interpretation to the therapist",
                "The practitioner should prescribe specific frequencies as a replacement for medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sound practitioners are not licensed mental health clinicians. Their role is to facilitate the 'felt sense' and somatic release, while the therapist handles the cognitive and emotional processing of the experience."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study on sound and neurodivergence found that certain 'stimming' behaviors in ADHD clients were reduced by which type of sonic stimulation?",
            "options": [
                "White noise and consistent 'brown' frequencies",
                "High-pitched, erratic bird songs",
                "Silence interrupted by sudden loud crashes",
                "Extremely fast-tempo techno music"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Consistent, low-level 'colored' noise (white, pink, or brown) can provide a 'sensory blanket' that helps individuals with ADHD filter out distracting environmental stimuli and reduce the urge to stim."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Red Flag' symptom during a sound session that requires immediate cessation and medical referral?",
            "options": [
                "The client reporting they feel 'very relaxed'",
                "The client seeing colors or geometric shapes behind their eyelids",
                "A sudden, localized 'sharp, stabbing' pain or a sudden loss of motor control",
                "The client falling asleep and snoring lightly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While emotional release and visual imagery are common, sudden physical pain or loss of motor function (which could indicate a neurological event or a seizure in predisposed individuals) requires immediate attention and professional medical referral."
