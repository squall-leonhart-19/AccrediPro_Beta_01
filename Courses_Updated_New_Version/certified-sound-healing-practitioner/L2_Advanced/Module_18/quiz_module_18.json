            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "In the context of Dynamic Entrainment for complex trauma, why is 'Oscillating Frequency' preferred over static, high-intensity entrainment?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the client's nervous system from 'flooding' or re-traumatization",
                "To ensure the session lasts longer for better value",
                "Because static frequencies are unable to penetrate the fascia",
                "To increase the heart rate to a state of aerobic exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Oscillating frequencies provide a 'pendulation' effect, allowing the nervous system to touch the trauma and then return to safety, avoiding the overwhelm known as 'flooding.'"

                "To mask any mistakes made by the practitioner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Bridge' layer serves as the connective tissue between grounding frequencies (Foundation) and spiritual/cognitive frequencies (Peak), ensuring a smooth energetic transition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 3:2 ratio (the Perfect Fifth) is the most stable interval in sound healing, used to create balance and open channels between the physical and energetic bodies."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "When resolving a chronic energetic blockage (Sonic Shadow), what is the correct sequence of application?",
            "options": [
                "Consonance -> Dissonance -> Silence",
                "Dissonance -> Consonance -> Integration",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The protocol requires introducing controlled dissonance to break up the stagnant pattern, followed by consonance to reorganize the energy, and integration to seal the change."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Structural Alignment.' What physiological property of bone allows sound waves to be converted into electrical signals to promote healing?",
