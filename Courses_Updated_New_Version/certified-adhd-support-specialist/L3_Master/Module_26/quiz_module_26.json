            "question": "What is the primary objective of using a 'Modular Architecture' when designing an ADHD support program?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure every client follows the exact same linear path to recovery",
                "To allow for rapid personalization by swapping intervention 'blocks' based on the client's unique profile",
                "To reduce the amount of content the coach needs to prepare",
                "To focus exclusively on pharmacological interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modular architecture allows coaches to customize the program by selecting specific modules that address a client's unique executive function gaps, rather than using a 'one-size-fits-all' approach."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In the 'Trace the Profile' Assessment Suite, why is it necessary to map the 'Interest-Based Nervous System' alongside executive functions?",
            "options": [
                "Because ADHD individuals are only motivated by importance and rewards",
                "To determine if the client has a comorbid learning disability",
                "Because traditional 'importance-based' motivation often fails in ADHD, making interest, novelty, and challenge the primary drivers of activation",
                "To provide data for a formal clinical diagnosis of ADHD"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dr. William Dodson’s research highlights that the ADHD nervous system is interest-based, not importance-based. Mapping this helps design interventions that leverage natural dopamine triggers."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to the principles of Curriculum Design for ADHD, what does 'Micro-Learning' specifically address?",
            "options": [
                "The need for long, intensive study sessions to build 'grit'",
                "Working memory constraints and the tendency for cognitive overload",
                "The requirement for physical exercise before learning",
                "The preference for auditory-only learning materials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-learning breaks content into small, digestible chunks, which respects the limited working memory capacity often associated with ADHD."

                "A strict punishment system for missed deadlines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scalable scaffolding involves systems (like automation or visual cues) that support the client without requiring constant, non-scalable human intervention."

            "options": [
                "To have two coaches work with one client simultaneously",
                "To use the physical or virtual presence of another person to reduce the 'activation energy' required to start a task",
                "To mirror the client's body language to build rapport",
                "To provide a physical workout partner for the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body doubling is a proven activation strategy where the presence of another person helps the ADHD individual stay anchored and focused on a task."

            "options": [
                "It helps clients recognize the physical sensations of dysregulation before an emotional outburst occurs",
                "It is a requirement for insurance billing",
                "It eliminates the need for any emotional coaching",
                "It focuses on changing the client's external environment only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Interoception (sensing internal bodily states) is often impaired in ADHD. Teaching clients to recognize physical cues of stress allows for earlier intervention and better regulation."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "A client has mastered their new organizational system but still feels like a 'failure' due to past experiences. This indicates the program needs more focus on:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Program design must address the psychological impact of ADHD (shame, low self-efficacy) to ensure long-term success and autonomy."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "What is the 'Fading Support' model in the context of measuring long-term autonomy?",

                "Suddenly stopping all support to see if the client 'swims or sinks'",
                "Gradually reducing external scaffolds as the client internalizes habits and self-regulation strategies",
                "Reducing the quality of service over time to encourage the client to leave",
                "Only providing support when the client is in a state of crisis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fading support is a deliberate strategy to transition the client from coach-dependence to self-reliance by slowly removing external aids."

            "question": "From a Business Operations perspective, why is 'Scope of Practice' a critical ethical consideration when scaling an ADHD program?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent coaches from charging too much for their services",
                "To ensure coaches do not cross into medical diagnosis or therapy without proper licensure",
                "To limit the number of clients a coach can see in a day",
                "To ensure all coaches use the same software for billing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical scaling requires clear boundaries. Support specialists must distinguish their work from clinical psychology or psychiatry to protect both the client and the practitioner."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "Research suggests that ADHD outcomes are significantly improved when programs include 'Point-of-Performance' interventions. What does this mean in practice?",
            "options": [
                "Providing support and cues at the exact time and place where the task needs to be performed",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Dr. Russell Barkley emphasizes that ADHD is a 'disorder of doing, not knowing.' Interventions are most effective when they occur at the 'point of performance'—where the skill is actually needed."
