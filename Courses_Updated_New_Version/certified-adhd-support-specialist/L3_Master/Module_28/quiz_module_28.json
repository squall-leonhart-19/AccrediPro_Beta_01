            "options": [
                "Top-down regulation from the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) becomes hyper-active.",
                "The Amygdala triggers a 'bottom-up' hijack, bypassing the weakened PFC.",

                "The Cerebellum takes over emotional regulation to maintain balance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In crisis, the ADHD brain experiences a 'bottom-up' hijack where the Amygdala overrides the already impaired Prefrontal Cortex, leading to emotional dysregulation and loss of executive control."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During acute de-escalation, the priority is 'low arousal'—reducing sensory input and providing validation to help the nervous system return to a state of safety before any cognitive work can begin."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
