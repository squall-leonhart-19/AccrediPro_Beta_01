            "question": "In high-performance leadership, what is the primary reason 'Decision Fatigue' hits ADHD executives harder than their neurotypical peers?",
            "options": [
                "They have a lower baseline of intelligence regarding business strategy",
                "Impaired prioritization and response inhibition deplete cognitive reserves faster",
                "They are more likely to delegate too many tasks to their subordinates",
                "ADHD executives typically work fewer hours and lose momentum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD executives struggle with the 'executive cost' of constant prioritization. Because every decision requires more effortful inhibition and filtering, their cognitive battery (executive reserve) drains significantly faster, leading to late-day burnout."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Entrepreneurial Brain' framework, which role is the most critical hire for an ADHD founder to prevent 'Execution Gap'?",
            "options": [
                "A Creative Director to help with more ideas",
                "A Sales Lead to increase revenue",
                "An 'Integrator' or Chief Operating Officer (COO)",
                "A secondary Visionary to share the load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Execution Gap' occurs when a Visionary founder has ideas but lacks the follow-through. An Integrator (COO) provides the 'External Executive Function' necessary to turn ideation into operational reality."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "What is the 'Masking Paradox' often observed in Twice-Exceptional (2e) clients?",
            "options": [
                "Their ADHD is so severe it lowers their IQ scores permanently",
                "Their high intelligence hides their ADHD, while their ADHD hides their true intellectual potential",
                "They use physical masks to hide facial tics associated with ADHD",
                "They perform better in school when they are not interested in the subject"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In 2e individuals, high cognitive ability allows them to 'compensate' for deficits, making them appear 'average' or 'fine' while they are actually struggling immensely. This often results in a lack of support for both their giftedness and their disability."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "A female client reports that her ADHD medication feels 'completely ineffective' during the week before her period. What is the physiological basis for this?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone increases dopamine sensitivity, causing overstimulation",
                "Estrogen levels drop, which reduces dopamine synthesis and receptor sensitivity",
                "The medication is absorbed slower by the gut during the luteal phase",
                "Women with ADHD develop a temporary tolerance to stimulants every month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a neuromodulator of dopamine. When estrogen drops during the luteal phase (and significantly during perimenopause), dopamine levels fall, often rendering standard stimulant doses less effective."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "When working with the aging brain (65+), how can a specialist distinguish ADHD from early-stage Alzheimer’s or Dementia?",
            "options": [
                "ADHD symptoms must have been present since childhood; Dementia is a marked decline from a previous baseline",
                "ADHD only affects focus, whereas Dementia only affects memory",
                "Stimulant medication will cure Dementia but not ADHD",
                "There is no way to distinguish them as they are the same condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'longitudinal history' is key. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition with a lifespan history of symptoms. Dementia represents a 'change' or 'loss' of previously functioning cognitive abilities."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In the context of 'Complex Co-occurring Conditions,' what does the term 'Diagnostic Overshadowing' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "When a patient has so many conditions they cannot be treated",
                "When a clinician attributes all symptoms to one visible condition (like Anxiety) and misses the underlying ADHD",
                "When the shadow of a parent's ADHD affects the child's diagnosis",
                "When a patient's ADHD improves so much that other conditions disappear"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when the symptoms of ADHD are incorrectly attributed to a co-occurring disorder (like Bipolar or GAD), leading to incomplete or ineffective treatment plans."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "What is the 'Executive Load' in the context of ADHD parenting?",
            "options": [
                "The weight of the laptop a parent carries to work",
                "The total cognitive demand of managing one’s own ADHD plus the schedules, emotions, and logistics of the family",
                "The financial burden of paying for ADHD coaching",
                "The physical exhaustion from playing with children"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Executive Load refers to the 'mental energy' required to track multiple schedules, manage household logistics, and regulate emotions for the entire family unit, which is particularly taxing for a parent with ADHD."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "Why do many ADHD students who were successful in undergraduate programs 'hit a wall' in Medical or Law school?",
            "options": [
                "They are no longer smart enough for the material",
                "The shift from 'structured learning' to 'high-volume synthesis' and 'unstructured study' exceeds their executive capacity",
                "Stimulant medications are banned in graduate-level programs",
                "They lose interest in the subject matter once it becomes professional"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-stakes academics require massive 'self-directed' executive function. In undergrad, external structures (syllabi, frequent tests) often support the student. In post-grad, the sheer volume of information and lack of daily structure often lead to executive collapse."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A 52-year-old male executive with ADHD is struggling with 'Analysis Paralysis' regarding a company merger. Which intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Telling him to 'just trust his gut' and sign the papers",
                "Setting a 'deciding deadline' and using a 'weighted criteria matrix' to externalize the logic",
                "Suggesting he take a month-long sabbatical to clear his head",
                "Increasing his medication dosage until the anxiety disappears"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalizing the decision-making process using tools (like a matrix) and firm deadlines reduces the 'internal' executive load and prevents the circular thinking common in ADHD 'Analysis Paralysis.'"

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'protective factor' for a Twice-Exceptional (2e) child in a school setting?",
            "options": [
                "A curriculum that focuses only on their weaknesses to 'fix' them",
                "Strength-based learning that allows them to engage with advanced content while receiving accommodations for output",
                "Placing them in a remedial class so they can be the 'smartest' in the room",
                "Ignoring the ADHD and only focusing on their giftedness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "2e students thrive when their 'gifted' side is fed with high-level content (preventing boredom/behavioral issues) while simultaneously receiving support (like scribes or extra time) for their ADHD-related output challenges."
