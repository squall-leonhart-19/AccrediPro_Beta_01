            "id": "q24_1",
            "question": "In the 'Trace' methodology of Advanced Neuro-Biological Profiling, what is the primary purpose of identifying 'Neuro-Biological Friction Points'?",
            "options": [
                "To determine the client's IQ score relative to their peers",
                "To pinpoint specific environmental or internal triggers that cause executive function collapse",
                "To provide a formal medical diagnosis of ADHD subtypes",
                "To select the appropriate stimulant medication dosage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Friction points are the specific intersections where a client's neurobiology meets an environmental demand they aren't equipped to handle, leading to 'crashes' or paralysis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "When using 'Dopamine Mapping,' what is the strategic function of a 'High-Stimulus Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "To act as a reward that is only given after 8 hours of work",
                "To serve as a transition tool that generates enough neurochemical momentum to bridge into a low-interest task",
                "To distract the client from stressful thoughts during the workday",
                "To replace all boring tasks with exciting ones permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-stimulus anchors leverage the 'Harness' principle, using dopamine-rich activities to provide the 'activation energy' needed to initiate more difficult, low-dopamine tasks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "According to Cognitive Load Architecture (Restructure), which type of load should a practitioner aim to REDUCE to help an ADHD client succeed?",
            "options": [
                "Intrinsic Load",
                "Germane Load",
                "Extraneous Load",
                "Biological Load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extraneous load refers to unnecessary mental effort caused by poor task design or distracting environments. Reducing this preserves the limited executive resources of the ADHD brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A client is experiencing 'Chronic Task Paralysis' despite knowing exactly what to do. What is the most likely cause according to the 'Initiate' framework?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of willpower and personal discipline",
                "An 'Emotional Wall of Awful' creating a physiological freeze response",
                "A failure to use a digital calendar effectively",
                "Low intelligence in the area of project management"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Task paralysis in ADHD is often a physiological state of 'freeze' caused by the emotional weight or perceived complexity of a task, rather than a lack of knowledge or desire."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In the 'Validate' phase of managing Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), what is the practitioner's primary goal?",
            "options": [
                "To prove to the client that their perception of rejection is logically incorrect",
                "To de-escalate the nervous system by acknowledging the physiological intensity of the experience",
                "To encourage the client to confront the person they feel rejected by immediately",
                "To suggest the client ignore the feeling until it goes away"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validation targets the nervous system. By acknowledging that the pain is 'real' and intense, the practitioner helps the client move out of a fight-or-flight state so logic can eventually return."

        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Neuro-Affirming Self-Advocacy' (Empower)?",
            "options": [
                "Learning to mask ADHD symptoms so well that others don't notice them",
                "Asking for help while apologizing for being a burden to the team",
                "Requesting specific functional accommodations based on how the brain works rather than just the diagnosis",
                "Demanding that everyone else change their behavior without the client making any adjustments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming advocacy focuses on 'functional needs' (e.g., 'I work best with written instructions') which empowers the individual without pathologizing their brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "During 'Integrative Case Conceptualization,' why is it critical to identify 'Comorbid Overlap'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner is charging the correct hourly rate",
                "To distinguish between ADHD symptoms and symptoms of other conditions like PTSD, ASD, or Anxiety",
                "To determine if the client is 'faking' their symptoms for attention",
                "To decide which medication the client should be taking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD rarely exists in isolation. A Master Practitioner must understand how different conditions interact to create a truly effective, integrated support plan."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "What is the 'Master Practitioner Mindset' regarding professional ethics and scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "A Master Practitioner can treat clinical depression if the client also has ADHD",
                "A Master Practitioner recognizes when a client's needs exceed coaching and facilitates a referral to a clinical professional",
                "A Master Practitioner should give specific medical advice regarding stimulant side effects",
                "A Master Practitioner should encourage clients to stop therapy and only use ADHD support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional ethics require staying within the scope of practice. Coaching/Support is not therapy or medicine; identifying the need for clinical intervention is a hallmark of an expert."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client has a 'Dopamine Crash' every day at 3:00 PM. Using the 'Harness' methodology, what is the best intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Forcing the client to do their most boring administrative work at 3:00 PM to 'get it over with'",
                "Scheduling a high-interest, strength-based activity at 2:45 PM to provide a 'neurochemical bridge'",
                "Telling the client to drink more caffeine to power through the slump",
                "Advising the client to end their workday at 3:00 PM every day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic Strength Integration involves placing high-dopamine/strength-based tasks right before or during known 'slump' periods to maintain neuro-biological momentum."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "What does 'Externalizing Executive Function' mean in the context of Scaffolding (Restructure)?",
            "options": [
                "Relying on others to do all the work for the client",
                "Using physical tools, visual cues, and environmental structures to offload the mental work of the prefrontal cortex",
                "Trying harder to remember things without using any tools",
                "Moving to a new house to get a 'fresh start' on organization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because the ADHD brain has a limited 'working memory' and executive capacity, we must 'externalize' those functions into the environment using timers, checklists, and visual reminders."
