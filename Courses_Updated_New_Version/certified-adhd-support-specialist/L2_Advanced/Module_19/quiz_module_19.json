            "question": "According to current neurobiological research, which neural network often fails to deactivate in individuals with ADHD when they attempt to focus on a specific task?",
            "options": [
                "The Task Positive Network (TPN)",
                "The Default Mode Network (DMN)",

                "The Visual Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In ADHD, the Default Mode Network (associated with mind-wandering) often remains active even when the Task Positive Network should be engaged, leading to internal distraction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD is highly heritable, with scientific consensus placing the heritability rate between 74% and 80%, making it one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA Study) demonstrated that while medication was highly effective for core symptom reduction, what was the benefit of adding behavioral interventions?",
            "options": [
                "It allowed for lower medication dosages and improved functional outcomes in social/family domains.",
                "It completely eliminated the need for medication in 90% of participants.",
                "It had no measurable impact compared to medication alone.",
                "It was only effective for children with comorbid anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MTA study showed that combined treatment (multimodal) provided better results for functional outcomes like social skills and allowed for more optimized medication dosing."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Which neurochemical process explains why individuals with ADHD often experience 'Reward Deficiency,' leading to a preference for immediate gratification?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reduced sensitivity or availability of dopamine receptors in the reward centers (ventral striatum) means individuals with ADHD require higher levels of stimulation to feel 'rewarded.'"

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In the context of neuroplasticity, what is the role of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in ADHD management?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a sedative to reduce hyperactivity.",
                "It is a waste product that causes brain fog.",
                "It supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth of new synapses during learning.",
                "It prevents the absorption of stimulant medications."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a protein that supports neuroplasticity; exercise and cognitive strategies can boost BDNF, helping the ADHD brain build more efficient executive function pathways."

            "options": [
                "Improved long-term career success",
                "Higher levels of social integration and happiness",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While masking may provide short-term social safety, research indicates it leads to significant psychological distress, exhaustion, and poorer mental health outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence shows that while brain training may improve scores on the games themselves, assistive technology has better 'real-world' efficacy for managing daily ADHD challenges."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GAS is a evidence-based metric that allows practitioners to track individualized progress based on specific goals set by the client, rather than just tracking a reduction in general symptoms."

                "Influence whether certain genes are 'turned on' or 'turned off' without changing the DNA sequence.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics studies how factors like stress, nutrition, and environment influence gene expression (activation/deactivation) rather than altering the genetic code itself."
