            "question": "According to the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (MTA), which approach yielded the most significant long-term improvements in social skills and parent-child relations?",
            "options": [
                "Medication management alone",
                "Behavioral therapy alone",
                "Combined treatment (Medication + Behavioral interventions)",
                "Community-based care without specialized ADHD protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MTA study demonstrated that while medication is highly effective for core symptom reduction, combined treatment is superior for improving functional outcomes like social skills and family dynamics."

            "options": [
                "Discussed in a clinical office setting once per week",
                "Applied at the exact time and place where the executive function challenge occurs",
                "Focused on internalizing motivation through deep psychological reflection",
                "Implemented primarily through long-term rewards delayed by 30 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Barkley emphasizes that because ADHD is a disorder of 'doing' rather than 'knowing,' interventions must be 'scaffolds' placed at the point of performance (the time and place the task happens)."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When mapping executive function profiles, a client who struggles to estimate how long a task will take and often 'over-promises' is demonstrating a deficit in which specific domain?",
            "options": [
                "Inhibition",
                "Emotional Control",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A shortened time horizon or 'time blindness' is a hallmark of ADHD executive dysfunction, leading to difficulties in estimating task duration and planning future actions."

            "id": "q21_4",

            "options": [
                "It is too simple and doesn't provide enough challenge",
                "The 'Realistic' component is often used to shame clients into lower expectations",
                "It relies on an importance-based nervous system rather than an interest-based one",
                "ADHD clients are incapable of being specific about their needs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Traditional SMART goals often fail ADHD clients because they rely on linear logic and 'importance.' Neuro-affirming goals prioritize the 'Interest-Based Nervous System' and avoid using 'realistic' as a proxy for 'neurotypical standards.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ADHD brains are triggered by Interest, Challenge, Novelty, and Urgency (ICNU), rather than the neurotypical drivers of Importance and Consequence."

            "options": [
                "Adding more consequences for failure to increase urgency",
                "Body doubling (working alongside another person)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body doubling provides a 'calm presence' that helps lower the emotional barrier (the Wall of Awful) and provides a social anchor for task initiation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Externalizing working memory requires making information physical and visible in the environment (out of sight, out of mind) through visual cues and clear storage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RSD is an intense physiological response. Effective support involves validating the client's pain (which feels real) and then using nervous system regulation before attempting cognitive shifts."

                "A permanent regression to pre-treatment symptom levels",
                "The loss of novelty in new routines, leading to a drop in dopamine and engagement",
                "The physiological withdrawal from ADHD medications",
                "A sudden increase in executive function capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Dip' occurs when the novelty of a new strategy wears off. Specialists must plan for this by 'rotating' strategies or adding new dopamine triggers to maintain the routine."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Small, manageable increments combined with gamification (Interest/Challenge) provide the dopamine necessary for an ADHD brain to engage with a repetitive, low-stimulation task like email management."
