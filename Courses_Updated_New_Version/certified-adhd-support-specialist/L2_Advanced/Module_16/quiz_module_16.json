            "question": "In the context of 'Executive Burnout,' what is the primary mechanism that leads high-performing professionals to a sudden 'functional collapse'?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of professional competence or technical skill",
                "The cumulative metabolic cost of prolonged masking and over-compensation",
                "A decrease in the dosage effectiveness of stimulant medication",
                "The natural cognitive decline associated with reaching middle management"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-performing professionals with ADHD often use 'masking' and 'anxiety-driven compensation' to perform. This creates a massive metabolic and cognitive load that eventually leads to autonomic exhaustion and functional collapse."

            "question": "For a client with an 'AuDHD' profile, what is the most common internal conflict regarding environmental structure?",

                "Hyperactivity (ADHD) clashing with physical lethargy (Autism)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AuDHD profile is often characterized by a 'tug-of-war' where the ADHD side seeks dopamine through change and novelty, while the Autistic side seeks safety through routine and consistency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Second Shift' refers to the cognitive load of managing a household (schedules, chores, emotional labor) which requires intense executive function after the workday is over."

            "id": "q16_5",

                "Approximately 10 times more likely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that individuals with untreated ADHD are 2 to 3 times more likely to struggle with SUD, often as a form of 'self-medication' to increase dopamine levels or quiet the mind."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To scale without chaos, the ADHD entrepreneur must delegate tasks that are 'dopamine-depleting' (like bookkeeping or filing) to focus on 'high-dopamine' visionary work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a key role in modulating dopamine. As estrogen levels drop during menopause, dopamine signaling becomes less effective, often worsening ADHD symptoms or making previously managed symptoms unmanageable."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When ADHD is comorbid with PTSD, how can a coach distinguish between ADHD 'hyperactivity' and PTSD 'hypervigilance'?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperactivity is always physical; hypervigilance is always mental",
                "Hypervigilance is a scanning of the environment for threats, whereas ADHD hyperactivity is a need for stimulation",
                "They are the same physiological response and cannot be distinguished",
                "ADHD symptoms only appear in childhood, while PTSD only appears in adulthood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "2e learners often have a 'bottleneck' where their high-level 'Input' (understanding) cannot be matched by their 'Output' (organizing and executing the work) due to executive function deficits."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is in burnout, their nervous system is dysregulated. Implementing complex new productivity systems will fail until the client has undergone a period of recovery and regulation."
