            "question": "In the context of Advanced Metacognitive Scaffolding, what is the primary objective of 'Internalized Verbalization'?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the speed of task completion through silent repetition",
                "To transition the client from external coach-led prompts to an internal self-regulatory 'inner voice'",
                "To reduce the client's need for any environmental modifications",
                "To eliminate the need for dopamine-based reward systems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced scaffolding aims to move the client from 'external regulation' (relying on a coach) to 'internal regulation,' where they use their own internalized voice to monitor and adjust behavior."

            "question": "When engineering a 'Flow State' for an ADHD client, what is the significance of the 'Challenge-Skill Balance'?",
            "options": [
                "Tasks must be significantly harder than the client's skill level to trigger hyperfocus",
                "Tasks must be significantly easier than the skill level to avoid executive burnout",
                "The task difficulty must slightly exceed the client's current skill level to maintain engagement without causing anxiety",
                "Skill level is irrelevant as long as the dopamine reward is high enough"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flow state occurs in the 'Goldilocks zone' where the challenge is high enough to prevent boredom (ADHD under-stimulation) but not so high that it triggers the amygdala (anxiety/avoidance)."

                "Discussing the importance of medication in a weekly coaching session",
                "Setting a generic alarm on the client's phone for 8:00 AM",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Point of Performance interventions place the support tool exactly where and when the behavior needs to occur, reducing the cognitive load required to remember the task."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchoring uses physical cues to stimulate the vagus nerve, signaling the body to exit 'fight or flight' mode and return to a state of calm (parasympathetic activation)."

            "options": [
                "RSD is a slow-building feeling of unease in social situations",
                "RSD involves an intense, sudden emotional 'flash' triggered by a specific perceived rejection",
                "RSD only occurs in individuals who do not have ADHD",
                "RSD is primarily focused on a fear of future scrutiny rather than past interactions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is characterized by its suddenness and intensity; it is an agonizing emotional reaction to a specific event of perceived rejection, whereas social anxiety is often a generalized, anticipatory fear."

                "A technique used to make a client more dependent on the coach for long-term retention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fading is the intentional process of thinning out support systems as the client internalizes the skills, ensuring they achieve true independence rather than perpetual reliance on the coach."

                "The need for high-sensory environments to satisfy ADHD curiosity",
                "The conflict between the ADHD brain's craving for novelty and the Autistic brain's need for sameness and predictability",

                "The tendency to seek out repetitive tasks that provide no dopamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AuDHD individuals often experience a 'tug-of-war' where one part of their neurobiology seeks new experiences (ADHD) while the other part is overwhelmed by the change and requires routine (Autism)."

                "The school is not allowed to change the student's teacher during the school year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Stay Put' provision is a critical legal protection that prevents a school from unilaterally changing a student's services while a disagreement is being legally mediated."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Dopamine Bridge' involves preemptively engaging in a high-dopamine, low-effort activity just before a known energy drop to maintain executive function through the transition."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "What does 'Trauma-Informed Care' in ADHD support require the coach to assume about a client's 'resistance' to a task?",
            "options": [
                "The client is being intentionally defiant and needs firmer boundaries",
                "The 'resistance' may be a protective nervous system response (freeze) rather than a lack of motivation",
                "The client has lost interest in the coaching process entirely",
                "The task is simply too easy and needs more challenge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed practitioners view 'resistance' through the lens of the nervous system, recognizing that executive shutdown is often a 'freeze' response to perceived threat or overwhelm."
