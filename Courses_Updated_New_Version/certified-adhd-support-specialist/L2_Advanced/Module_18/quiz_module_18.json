            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Method™, what is the primary purpose of the 'Radical Acceptance' (R) component when working with ADHD clients?",
            "options": [
                "To lower expectations so the client does not feel pressured to perform",
                "To eliminate the 'shame-spiral' by acknowledging neurobiological realities before attempting behavioral change",
                "To accept that ADHD cannot be managed and focus strictly on environmental changes",
                "To encourage the client to accept their diagnosis without seeking further medical intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Radical Acceptance is critical because it halts the physiological stress response associated with shame, which otherwise inhibits the prefrontal cortex and prevents effective executive function coaching."

            "question": "When tracing neuro-biological intersections in advanced profiling, how does the 'Estrogen-Dopamine Connection' typically affect AFAB (Assigned Female At Birth) clients?",
            "options": [
                "High estrogen levels lead to a decrease in dopamine, requiring higher stimulant doses",
                "Estrogen acts as a dopamine antagonist, worsening symptoms during ovulation",
                "Falling estrogen levels in the luteal phase reduce dopamine availability, often rendering ADHD medications less effective",
                "Progesterone increases dopamine synthesis, usually eliminating ADHD symptoms during the premenstrual week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen modulates dopamine receptor sensitivity. When estrogen drops during the luteal phase (or menopause), dopamine signaling weakens, which frequently leads to an exacerbation of ADHD symptoms and decreased medication efficacy."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "To transition a client from 'Hyperfocus' to 'Sustainable Flow,' what is the most effective strategic intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating all high-interest tasks to prevent hyperfocus from occurring",
                "Implementing 'Interstitial Breaks'—scheduled, low-stimulation transitions that prevent cognitive depletion",
                "Using high-arousal alarms to startle the client out of a deep focus state",
                "Increasing the duration of hyperfocus sessions to maximize total daily output"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperfocus is often 'brittle' and leads to burnout. Sustainable Flow requires intentional 'interstitial breaks' to check in with physiological needs and prevent the total depletion of cognitive reserves."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Ecosystem Scaffolding' protocol, what is the '2-Minute Friction Rule' designed to address?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring every task takes no longer than 2 minutes to complete",
                "Reducing the physical or digital steps required to initiate a task to under 2 minutes of effort",
                "Waiting 2 minutes before starting a task to practice impulse control",
                "A rule stating that ADHD clients lose focus if a task isn't rewarding within 2 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2-Minute Friction Rule focuses on task initiation by removing 'micro-barriers' (e.g., having to find a pen, clear a desk) so the path from intention to action is as frictionless as possible."

        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "In the context of 'Chronic Paralysis,' why is 'Body Doubling' considered a neurobiologically valid initiation protocol?",
            "options": [
                "It creates a 'social mirror' that increases cortical arousal and provides external regulation for the client's nervous system",
                "It works by shaming the client into working because someone else is watching",
                "It reduces the client's workload by having the second person perform half the tasks",
                "It is only effective because it provides a distraction from the anxiety of the task"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Body doubling provides a 'social anchor' that helps regulate the ADHD nervous system, increasing the baseline level of arousal necessary for the prefrontal cortex to engage in task initiation."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is a common intersection in ADHD. How does it differ from standard clinical depression?",
            "options": [
                "RSD is long-lasting and occurs without a specific trigger",
                "RSD episodes are typically brief, intense, and triggered by a specific perceived rejection or failure",
                "RSD only occurs in children, while depression occurs in adults",
                "RSD is treated exclusively with SSRIs, whereas depression is not"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike the 'heavy' and persistent mood of depression, RSD is characterized by sudden, intense emotional 'crashes' that are directly tied to an external event or perceived judgment, often resolving quickly once the trigger passes."

            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "During the transition to 'Sustainable Autonomy,' what is the recommended threshold for 'Fading Scaffolds'?",
            "options": [
                "Remove all support as soon as the client has one successful week",
                "Begin fading support when the client achieves 80% consistency in a specific area for at least 21 days",
                "Never remove scaffolds; ADHD clients require permanent external support for all tasks",
                "Remove scaffolds only when the client specifically asks to stop coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fading should be data-driven. Reaching 80% consistency suggests the behavior is becoming internalized or the environment is sufficiently optimized to begin testing the client's self-coaching capabilities."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "In the Case Synthesis of 'Sarah' (34, ADHD-C, high anxiety), why must the practitioner prioritize 'Nervous System Regulation' before 'Executive Function Scaffolding'?",
            "options": [
                "Because ADHD medication doesn't work if the client is anxious",
                "Because a dysregulated nervous system (fight/flight) effectively 'shuts down' the prefrontal cortex, making skill-building impossible",
                "Because anxiety is easier to fix than ADHD",
                "Because Sarah's anxiety is likely unrelated to her ADHD symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Executive function coaching is ineffective if the client is in a state of chronic sympathetic nervous system arousal. Regulation must come first to 're-open' the window of tolerance for learning new skills."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "Statistics from lesson L5 indicate that 'Dopamine Priming' (engaging in 10-15 minutes of a high-interest activity) can improve task initiation in 'low-dopamine' tasks by approximately:",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "40-60%",
                "90-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dopamine priming effectively 'pre-loads' the brain with the neurotransmitters needed to overcome the 'activation wall' of boring or difficult tasks, showing significant improvement rates in the 40-60% range."

        {
            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "Which intervention is an example of 'Point-of-Performance Externalization' for a client with severe working memory deficits?",
            "options": [
                "Having the client write a long-term 5-year plan in a journal",
                "Placing a clear bin of cleaning supplies directly on the kitchen counter rather than under the sink",
                "Asking the client to memorize their daily schedule every morning",
                "Providing a 50-page manual on how to organize a home"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Point-of-Performance externalization means placing the cue or tool exactly where the action needs to happen. Visible cleaning supplies on the counter reduce the working memory load required to remember and initiate the task."
