            "question": "In the AuDHD profile (ADHD and Autism co-occurrence), what is the primary conflict described as the 'internal tug-of-war'?",
            "options": [
                "The ADHD need for high-stimulation and novelty versus the Autistic need for routine and predictability.",
                "The ADHD desire for social interaction versus the Autistic desire for complete isolation.",
                "The ADHD tendency for hyperfocus versus the Autistic inability to focus on a single task.",
                "The ADHD need for physical movement versus the Autistic preference for absolute stillness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "AuDHD individuals often experience a conflict where their ADHD seeks novelty and dopamine-rich experiences, while their Autistic side requires sameness and structure to prevent sensory overwhelm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both share emotional dysregulation, hypervigilance (constantly scanning for threats) and a sense of a foreshortened future are specific indicators of trauma/C-PTSD."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Dopamine Loop' in Lesson 4, why are individuals with untreated ADHD statistically 2-3 times more likely to develop a Substance Use Disorder (SUD)?",
            "options": [
                "Because ADHD medication is inherently addictive and leads to harder drugs.",
                "Due to 'self-medication' attempts to increase synaptic dopamine and manage executive dysfunction.",
                "Because ADHD individuals lack the moral willpower to resist peer pressure.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Self-Medication Hypothesis' suggests that individuals use substances to temporarily alleviate the chronic dopamine deficiency and executive function gaps associated with ADHD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen acts as a modulator for dopamine; as estrogen drops during menopause, dopamine efficiency decreases, often rendering previous coping mechanisms or medication dosages ineffective."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Binge Eating Disorder (BED) has a high co-occurrence with ADHD (up to 30% in some studies) because the act of binging provides a rapid, high-intensity dopamine surge for an under-stimulated brain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5-minute rule reduces the perceived 'threat' of a daunting task, making it easier for the ADHD brain to initiate action (activation)."
