            "question": "A client spends a session ruminating on childhood trauma and expresses that they cannot move forward with ADHD strategies until they 'heal their past.' According to the Professional Scope guidelines, what is the most ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Incorporate trauma-informed coaching techniques to help them process the childhood memories.",
                "Explain that coaching focuses on present-day functional strategies and refer them to a licensed mental health professional for trauma work.",
                "Tell the client to ignore the past and focus only on their current executive function goals.",
                "Offer a discount on coaching sessions until they feel they have healed enough to return to strategy work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The coaching-therapy divide dictates that while coaches are trauma-informed, healing past trauma or clinical 'processing' falls under the scope of therapy. Coaches focus on the 'how' (strategies) rather than the 'why' (past pathology)."

                "Reading the entire 10-page contract aloud during the first session.",
                "Asking the client to sign the document quickly so you can start the session.",
                "Providing a multi-modal approach, including a written summary, a video explanation, and a verbal Q&A session.",
                "Assuming that if they signed the digital form, they have fully understood and consented to all terms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming consent accounts for executive function and processing differences. Multi-modal communication ensures the client actually comprehends the agreement, supporting true autonomy."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "An ADHD Support Specialist accidentally leaves a physical folder containing client notes in a public coffee shop. Which ethical principle has been primarily violated?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality and data security are paramount. This scenario highlights how a coach's own executive function challenges (forgetfulness) can lead to significant ethical breaches regarding client privacy."

                "Advise the client to document their observations and discuss dosage adjustments exclusively with their prescribing physician."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never give medical advice, including dosage changes or supplement recommendations. The ethical role is to support the client in communicating effectively with their medical provider."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality, a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, refers to how various social identities (like being a Black woman with ADHD) intersect to create unique systemic barriers and lived experiences."

                "Terminate the session immediately to avoid liability.",
                "Tell the client that their feelings are just a symptom of ADHD and they should try a breathing exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The coach must distinguish between the common ADHD experience of emotional dysregulation/overwhelm and a true clinical crisis. Clarifying questions are the first step before escalating to mandatory reporting protocols."

            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "A coach begins to feel a 'savior complex' toward a client, often staying 30 minutes late for sessions and responding to texts at 11:00 PM. This is a failure of which ethical area?",

                "Mandatory Reporting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blurring boundaries by over-extending hours or constant availability creates an unhealthy power dynamic and risks the coach’s professional sustainability and the client’s autonomy."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "According to research on cultural competence, why are Black and Latino children often diagnosed with ADHD later than white children?",
            "options": [
                "They are less likely to have ADHD symptoms.",
                "Symptoms are more likely to be misinterpreted as 'behavioral issues' or 'defiance' due to systemic bias.",
                "ADHD medication is not effective for these populations.",
                "There is no statistical difference in the age of diagnosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic bias often leads to the 'criminalization' of ADHD symptoms in marginalized communities, where behaviors are viewed as intentional defiance rather than executive function challenges."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing requires honesty and the avoidance of 'guaranteed' outcomes. ADHD is a neurobiological condition that is managed, not 'cured,' and testimonials must be used responsibly."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "A coach realizes they are experiencing significant 'compassion fatigue' and are becoming irritable with clients. What is the most ethical professional sustainability action?",

            "explanation": "Professional sustainability requires recognizing signs of burnout or vicarious trauma. Ethical practitioners seek supervision and adjust their workload to ensure they can continue providing high-quality care without harming clients."
