            "options": [
                "As a permanent cognitive deficit that requires constant suppression.",
                "As a series of behavioral choices that can be corrected through discipline.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The strength-based paradigm views ADHD not as an inherent 'brokenness,' but as a neurobiological profile that is often poorly matched to modern, linear environments."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While flow is productive and restorative, dysregulated perseveration (stuckness) is characterized by a loss of agency and neglect of basic needs."

                "That ADHD is caused by trauma.",
                "That individuals can develop superior coping mechanisms and wisdom as a direct result of navigating a neurotypical world.",
                "That resilience is an innate trait that cannot be learned.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD brains struggle to prioritize based on 'Importance' alone; they typically require Interest, Novelty, Challenge, or Urgency (the INCUP model)."

                "A negligible effect (0.1).",
                "A moderate to large effect (0.5 - 0.7) in divergent thinking domains.",
                "A negative effect, meaning they were less creative.",
