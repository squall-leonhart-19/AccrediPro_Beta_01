                "Hiring a secondary employee to perform the individual's administrative tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Task initiation is often hindered by the perceived 'weight' of a task. Committing to just five minutes lowers the barrier to entry and often leads to sustained momentum."

                "The ADHD brain lacks the ability to process protein",

                "ADHD individuals have a higher metabolic rate that requires more sugar",
