            "question": "The T.H.R.I.V.E. Method™ is designed as a 'neuro-affirming' framework. What is the primary goal of this approach compared to traditional behavioral models?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate ADHD symptoms through rigorous cognitive training and discipline.",
                "To work with the ADHD nervous system rather than against it by emphasizing scaffolding and validation.",
                "To ensure the individual meets all neurotypical social standards and productivity benchmarks.",
                "To replace medication with environmental restructuring as the sole intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming care focuses on adapting environments and strategies to fit the ADHD brain's unique wiring (scaffolding and validation) rather than trying to 'fix' the person to meet neurotypical standards."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Trace the Profile), which executive function is described as the 'mental workspace' that ADHD individuals often find 'leaky,' making multi-step directions difficult to follow?",
            "options": [
                "Inhibition",
                "Emotional Regulation",
                "Working Memory",
                "Cognitive Flexibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Working memory acts as the brain's temporary storage and manipulation site; in ADHD, this 'workspace' is often smaller, leading to lost information during complex tasks."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the research by Dr. William Dodson discussed in Lesson 3, what percentage of people with ADHD have an 'Interest-Based Nervous System' rather than an 'Importance-Based' one?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Exactly 50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dr. Dodson's clinical observations indicate that over 90% of ADHD individuals are motivated by interest, challenge, novelty, or urgency rather than the abstract 'importance' or 'rewards' that motivate neurotypical brains."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Point-of-Performance interventions place the support (the checklist) at the exact time and place where the behavior needs to occur (leaving the house)."

                "A physical lack of energy caused by poor sleep.",
                "The accumulation of past failures, shame, and anxiety associated with a task.",

                "A conscious decision to procrastinate for pleasure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Wall of Awful is the emotional barrier—built from layers of shame, failure, and frustration—that makes starting a task feel painful or impossible."

            "id": "q11_6",

            "options": [
                "Doing the task for the individual so they don't feel stressed.",
                "Removing all consequences so the individual never feels failure.",
                "Collaboratively building a system that the individual can eventually manage independently.",
                "Using 'tough love' to ensure the individual learns from their mistakes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable support involves collaborative scaffolding that builds the individual's capacity and autonomy, rather than simply removing the task or the individual's agency."

            "question": "When integrating the T.H.R.I.V.E. Method into a Comprehensive Support Plan (Lesson 8), why is 'Validation' often required before 'Initiation'?",
            "options": [
                "Because ADHD individuals need to be praised constantly to work.",
                "Because physiological regulation (calming the nervous system) is a prerequisite for executive functioning.",
                "Because validation is a form of reward that triggers dopamine.",
                "It isn't; initiation should always come first to build momentum."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a client is in a state of shame or fight/flight (dysregulated), the prefrontal cortex cannot engage. Validation helps regulate the nervous system so executive functions can come online."

            "question": "A student can spend 6 hours straight building complex robotics (Harnessing Strengths) but cannot start a 5-paragraph essay. What is the neuro-affirming intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Take away the robotics until the essay is finished.",
                "Explain that the essay is more 'important' for their future grades.",
                "Gamify the essay or use 'Body Doubling' to provide the necessary stimulation for initiation.",
                "Label the student as 'unmotivated' to spark a competitive drive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming care leverages the interest-based nervous system by adding stimulation (gamification) or social scaffolding (body doubling) to low-interest tasks."

            "options": [
                "To provide a formal medical diagnosis of ADHD.",
                "To act as an 'Executive Function Detective' to identify where specific cognitive processes are breaking down.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Trace' phase is about mapping the client's unique executive function profile—identifying specific strengths and 'leaks'—to inform the rest of the T.H.R.I.V.E. strategy."
