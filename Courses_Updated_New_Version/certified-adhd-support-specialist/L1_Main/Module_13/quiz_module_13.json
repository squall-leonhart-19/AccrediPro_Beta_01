            "question": "In the neuro-biological blueprint of ADHD, which brain network is often found to be 'hyper-active' during tasks that require external focus, leading to internal distraction?",
            "options": [
                "The Task-Positive Network (TPN)",
                "The Default Mode Network (DMN)",
                "The Ventral Striatum",
                "The Cerebellar Circuit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In neurotypical brains, the DMN deactivates when the TPN activates. In ADHD brains, the DMN often fails to suppress, leading to 'mind-wandering' and internal distractions during tasks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Barkley defines verbal working memory as 'internalized speech,' which ADHD individuals often struggle to use effectively for self-directed behavior and rule-following."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Rabbit Hole' is a maladaptive form of hyperfocus where the intensity of focus is high, but the alignment with the individual's goals or values is low."

            "options": [
                "To help the client improve their social skills",
                "Because masking is an effective long-term coping strategy",
                "To distinguish between genuine strengths and exhausting compensatory strategies",
                "To ensure the client receives a higher dose of medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Masking involves suppressing ADHD traits to appear neurotypical, which leads to high cognitive load and burnout; identifying it is essential for authentic identity reframing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is an intense emotional response to the perception of being rejected or criticized, which is common in ADHD due to emotional dysregulation, though not yet a formal DSM diagnosis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis involves looking at the 'whole person' to see how their unique neuro-biology interacts with their environment, moving beyond simple symptom checklists."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Urgency (the 'U' in ICNU) uses the pressure of a deadline to trigger a spike in dopamine and norepinephrine, allowing the ADHD brain to engage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lower baseline (tonic) dopamine levels mean the ADHD brain is in a state of 'reward deficiency,' leading the individual to seek high-stimulation (phasic) dopamine spikes."
