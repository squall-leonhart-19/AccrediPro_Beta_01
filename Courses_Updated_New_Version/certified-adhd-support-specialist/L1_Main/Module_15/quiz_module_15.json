            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "The THRIVE Method™ shifts the focus from a 'disorder' model to a neuro-affirming framework. What is the primary objective of this shift?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate all ADHD symptoms through behavioral conditioning.",
                "To bridge the gap between neurodivergent traits and environmental demands by focusing on strengths and accommodations.",
                "To prove that ADHD does not cause significant impairment in academic settings.",
                "To replace clinical diagnoses with purely social descriptors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE Method™ is neuro-affirming, meaning it focuses on understanding the neurobiology of ADHD to create environmental fits and leverage strengths rather than simply trying to 'fix' the individual to match neurotypical standards."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the neurobiological foundations of ADHD, what is the primary issue regarding the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Task Positive Network (TPN)?",
            "options": [
                "The TPN is overactive, leading to excessive focus on minor details.",
                "The DMN never activates, preventing the individual from resting or daydreaming.",
                "The 'toggle' switch fails to suppress the DMN when the TPN is activated, leading to internal distractions.",
                "Both networks are under-developed, resulting in a lack of internal monologue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In ADHD brains, the DMN (mind-wandering) often fails to deactivate when the TPN (task-focus) is engaged, causing the 'noise' of internal thoughts to interfere with external tasks."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to Dr. Russell Barkley's model of Executive Function, what is the 'master' deficit that often triggers other EF failures?",
            "options": [
                "Working Memory",
                "Emotional Regulation",
                "Behavioral Inhibition",
                "Reconstitution"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Barkley posits that Behavioral Inhibition—the ability to pause before reacting—is the foundational deficit that allows other executive functions (like working memory and self-regulation) to occur."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Interest-Based Nervous System' as defined by Dr. William Dodson?",
            "options": [
                "A system that prioritizes tasks based on their long-term importance and consequences.",
                "A nervous system that only responds to dopamine-depleting activities.",
                "A system that engages primarily when a task provides Interest, Challenge, Novelty, or Urgency (ICNU).",
                "A system that is easily regulated through standard organizational tools like planners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ADHD nervous system does not prioritize based on 'importance' or 'rewards,' but rather on the ICNU criteria: Interest, Challenge, Novelty, or Urgency."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "A client reports extreme emotional pain, almost physical in nature, following a perceived slight from a coworker. This is a hallmark of which ADHD-related phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)",
                "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)",

                "Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is an intense emotional response to perceived or actual rejection, teasing, or criticism, frequently seen in the ADHD population."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "When tracing the profile of a client during an intake assessment, why is it critical to screen for Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)?",
            "options": [
                "SPD is an official subtype of ADHD in the DSM-5.",
                "Sensory overload can often be mistaken for ADHD-related irritability or 'hyperactive' restlessness.",
                "SPD only occurs in the Inattentive presentation of ADHD.",
                "Treating SPD automatically cures the executive function deficits of ADHD."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SPD is a common comorbidity. Sensory 'seeking' can look like hyperactivity, and sensory 'avoidance' can look like emotional dysregulation or inattention."

                "Less than 10%",
                "Exactly 25%",
                "Approximately 50% to 65%",
                "Nearly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While symptoms may manifest differently (internalized restlessness vs. external hyperactivity), roughly 50-65% of individuals carry the diagnosis into adulthood."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "During the 'Trace' Assessment phase, a coach notices a client has high 'activation' energy but very low 'sustain' energy. This most likely indicates a deficit in which area?",
            "options": [
                "Response Inhibition",
                "Non-verbal Working Memory",
                "Task Persistence / Effort Regulation",
                "Verbal Working Memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Task persistence and the regulation of effort are specific executive functions required to maintain focus on a task until completion, even when the initial 'novelty' wears off."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Which neuroanatomical structure is primarily responsible for the 'reward circuit' and is often found to have lower dopamine receptor sensitivity in ADHD brains?",
            "options": [
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Basal Ganglia (specifically the Striatum)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia, particularly the striatum, is central to the reward processing and motivation pathways that are dysregulated in ADHD."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client with the Inattentive presentation of ADHD is struggling with 'time blindness.' Which practical intervention aligns best with the THRIVE neuro-affirming approach?",
            "options": [
                "Telling the client to 'just try harder' to be on time.",
                "Using externalized 'analog' visual timers to make the passage of time visible.",
                "Assigning a 50-page book on the history of time management.",
                "Removing all clocks to reduce the client's anxiety about being late."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming support focuses on externalizing executive functions. Analog timers provide a visual representation of time 'slipping away,' which helps compensate for internal time-blindness."
