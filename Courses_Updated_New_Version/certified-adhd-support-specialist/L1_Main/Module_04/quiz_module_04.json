            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for the 'valuation' of effort versus reward, often leading to task paralysis when dysfunctional in ADHD individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)",
                "Primary Visual Cortex",
                "Cerebellum",
                "Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The ACC acts as a 'cost-benefit' calculator; in ADHD, the perceived 'cost' of effort often outweighs the predicted reward, leading to initiation failure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to Brendan Mahan’s 'Wall of Awful' model, what is the primary emotional 'brick' that makes a task feel impossible to start?",
            "options": [
                "Boredom",
                "Shame",
                "Anger",
                "Confusion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shame from past failures creates an emotional barrier (the Wall of Awful) that requires more activation energy to overcome than the task itself."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, 'Micro-Tasking' is defined by breaking a project down until the first step is:",
            "options": [
                "At least 30 minutes long",
                "Challenging enough to trigger hyperfocus",
                "Ridiculously small (e.g., 'Open the laptop')",
                "A multi-step process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-tasking reduces the 'threat' response in the brain by making the first step so small it requires negligible cognitive effort to initiate."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Why does 'Body Doubling' effectively support ADHD clients during task initiation?",
            "options": [
                "It provides a person to do the work for them",
                "It creates a competitive environment that spikes cortisol",
                "It leverages social facilitation to lower the activation threshold",
                "It eliminates the need for the client to use their own Prefrontal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The presence of another person (the 'body double') acts as an external anchor, increasing the 'dopaminergic tone' and social accountability needed to stay on task."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A client decides to only listen to their favorite 'guilty pleasure' podcast while folding laundry. This is an example of which technique?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Temptation Bundling (a form of Dopamine Hook) pairs a 'should' task with a 'want' activity to provide the immediate reward the ADHD brain craves."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which phenomenon explains why ADHD individuals experience a significant drop in productivity and increased errors when moving between unrelated tasks?",
            "options": [
                "The Zeigarnik Effect",
                "Task Switching Cost",
                "The Pomodoro Effect",
                "Hyperfocus Rebound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Task Switching Cost refers to the cognitive 're-entry' time required for the brain to adjust to a new set of rules and goals, which is significantly higher in ADHD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "The 'Five-Minute Rule' works primarily because it:",
            "options": [
                "Ensures the task is completed in exactly five minutes",
                "Bypasses the 'limbic friction' by making the commitment feel temporary",
                "Trains the brain to have a shorter attention span",
                "Only works for physical tasks like cleaning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The rule lowers the barrier to entry by promising the brain it can stop after 5 minutes, which often leads to the Zeigarnik Effect (the drive to finish what was started)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of an 'Environmental Prime' used as an activation cue?",
            "options": [
                "Setting a mental goal to wake up early",
                "Placing gym clothes on top of the alarm clock",
                "Reading a book about exercise",
                "Thinking about how much you dislike your current fitness level"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental primes are physical 'nudges' that reduce the number of choices and steps required to initiate a desired behavior."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "When a client uses 'Anger' or 'Adrenaline' to 'smash' through the Wall of Awful, what is the likely long-term consequence?",
            "options": [
                "Sustainable habit formation",
                "Permanent resolution of task paralysis",
                "Burnout and reinforcement of negative emotional associations",
                "Improved relationship with the task"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'smashing' works temporarily, it relies on high-stress hormones that lead to burnout and add more 'shame bricks' to the wall for future tasks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "In 'Gamification' for ADHD, which element is most critical for maintaining engagement during a boring task?",

                "A large reward given at the end of the month",
                "Immediate feedback loops (e.g., points, sounds, or visual progress)",
                "Strict penalties for failure",
                "Complex rules that require high cognitive load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD brains require immediate feedback to maintain dopamine levels; delayed rewards are often too 'distant' to motivate the current moment of initiation."
