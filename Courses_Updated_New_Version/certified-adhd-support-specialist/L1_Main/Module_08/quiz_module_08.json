            "question": "According to the Interest-Based Nervous System (IBNS) framework, which of the following is NOT one of the four primary triggers for ADHD engagement?",
            "options": [
                "Novelty and Interest",
                "Consequence and Punishment",
                "Challenge and Competition",
                "Urgency and Pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The IBNS (Interest-Based Nervous System) responds to Interest, Novelty, Challenge, and Urgency. Standard neurotypical motivators like Importance, Rewards, and Consequences/Punishments are significantly less effective for the ADHD brain."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "In the context of Dopamine Dynamics, what is the primary function of a 'Dopamine Bridge'?",
            "options": [
                "To permanently increase baseline dopamine levels through supplements",
                "To eliminate the need for hyperfocus during repetitive tasks",
                "To use a high-dopamine activity to transition into a low-dopamine, high-priority task",
                "To suppress the prefrontal cortex during periods of intense creativity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Dopamine Bridge is a strategic transition tool that uses a stimulating activity to provide the neurological 'momentum' needed to initiate a task that lacks intrinsic stimulation."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Cognitive Ergonomics suggests that the 'Point of Performance' is critical. What does this concept entail?",
            "options": [
                "The exact time of day when a client's medication is most effective",
                "The physical and temporal space where a task must actually be executed",
                "The highest level of academic achievement a client has reached",
                "The specific IQ score required to overcome executive dysfunction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Point of Performance' is where the task happens. Cognitive ergonomics focuses on placing supports (reminders, tools, cues) exactly where the behavior is needed, rather than in a remote location like a planner in another room."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "When addressing 'The Wall of Awful' in Task Initiation, what is the most effective neuro-affirming strategy for a client stuck in paralysis?",
            "options": [
                "Practicing 'Positive Thinking' to ignore the emotional barrier",
                "Applying more pressure and consequences to force action",
                "Emotional 'climbing' by acknowledging the shame and micro-segmenting the first step",
                "Waiting for the 'Urgency' trigger to naturally resolve the paralysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Breaking task paralysis requires addressing the emotional layer (shame, fear of failure) and then reducing the cognitive load through micro-segmentation—breaking the task into steps so small they feel 'stupid' to ignore."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is often misdiagnosed as Social Anxiety. What is a key clinical differentiator of RSD?",
            "options": [
                "RSD is a slow-building feeling of dread that lasts for weeks",
                "RSD is characterized by an intense, sudden, and often physical 'crash' of emotional pain",
                "RSD only occurs in childhood and is outgrown by age 18",
                "RSD is exclusively triggered by actual, verified rejection from an authority figure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is characterized by its sudden onset, extreme intensity, and the fact that it can be triggered by *perceived* rejection or failure, often feeling like a physical wound to the individual."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "In the transition from Scaffolding to Habit, what defines 'Sustainable Autonomy'?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to function perfectly without any external tools or aids",
                "The transition from external compliance to internal self-regulation and customized systems",
                "Reverting to neurotypical standards of organization to fit into the workplace",
                "A state where dopamine levels remain constant throughout the day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable Autonomy isn't about removing tools; it's about the client owning their systems and knowing how to adjust them as their environment changes, moving away from doing things because they 'should' (compliance)."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "During a THRIVE Audit, a specialist identifies that a client's 'Environment' is high-friction but their 'Regulation' is stable. What is the priority intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Intensive psychotherapy for emotional trauma",
                "Increasing medication dosage immediately",
                "Environmental restructuring to reduce cognitive load (Cognitive Ergonomics)",
                "Practicing mindfulness to tolerate the high-friction environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE Audit identifies where the 'leak' is. If regulation is stable but the environment is the source of friction, the specialist prioritizes ergonomics and system design over emotional or physiological interventions."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios represents a specialist staying within their Professional Scope of Practice?",
            "options": [
                "Adjusting a client's stimulant dosage based on their reported side effects",
                "Providing a formal diagnosis of ADHD and Co-occurring Dyslexia",
                "Collaborating with a client to design a 'sensory-safe' workspace and workflow",
                "Treating a client's Major Depressive Disorder through cognitive behavioral therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD Support Specialists focus on environmental design, skill-building, and neuro-affirming support. They do not diagnose, treat clinical mental health disorders, or manage medications."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A client experiences a severe 'Post-Flow Crash' after 4 hours of hyperfocus. What is the most likely physiological cause addressed in Module 8?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of willpower and discipline",
                "Dopamine depletion and acute glucose/hydration deficit",
                "A permanent decline in executive function",
                "The brain's natural rejection of the task they were performing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperfocus is metabolically expensive. A 'Post-Flow Crash' is usually a result of dopamine depletion coupled with neglected physiological needs like hydration, nutrition (glucose), and physical movement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Neuro-Affirming' support as taught in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "To cure ADHD symptoms so the client appears neurotypical",
                "To validate the client's experience while building systems that work with their brain, not against it",
                "To encourage the client to ignore all societal rules and expectations",
                "To replace all medical interventions with holistic lifestyle changes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming care moves away from the 'deficit' model. It validates the individual's neurobiology and focuses on building a life that accommodates their unique brain wiring rather than forcing them to mask."
