            "question": "In the THRIVE Method™, what is the primary objective of the 'T' (Trace the Profile) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose the specific subtype of ADHD using clinical DSM-5 criteria.",
                "To map the individual's unique Executive Function landscape and cognitive bottlenecks.",
                "To eliminate all ADHD symptoms through intensive behavioral coaching.",
                "To provide a pharmacological recommendation based on symptom severity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tracing the Profile involves mapping the individual's unique Executive Function (EF) strengths and challenges, moving beyond a generic diagnosis to understand how ADHD manifests specifically for that person."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Which neurobiological phenomenon explains why an ADHD brain may struggle with 'boring' tasks but hyperfocus on 'stimulating' ones?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive tonic dopamine levels in the Prefrontal Cortex.",
                "A hyper-active Parasympathetic Nervous System.",
                "Low baseline (tonic) dopamine levels coupled with high phasic dopamine spikes in response to novelty.",
                "Structural overdevelopment of the Cerebellum."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD brains typically have lower baseline (tonic) dopamine. They require high-stimulation (phasic) triggers—like novelty, urgency, or interest—to reach the 'dopamine threshold' required for task engagement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "When mapping an Executive Function landscape, 'Working Memory' is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "The ability to remember events from early childhood.",
                "The 'mental workbench' used to hold and manipulate information in real-time.",
                "The capacity to remain still during a long meeting.",
                "The speed at which a person can read a technical manual."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working memory is the cognitive system that holds information temporarily for processing. In ADHD, this 'mental workbench' is often smaller, leading to lost instructions or forgotten intentions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Interest-Based Nervous System' (IBNS) framework, which of the following is NOT one of the four primary dopamine triggers?",
            "options": [
                "Novelty",
                "Urgency",
                "Importance (Linear Priority)",
                "Challenge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ADHD brain is driven by Interest, Novelty, Challenge, and Urgency (INCU). Standard 'Importance' or 'Consequences'—which drive the neurotypical 'Importance-Based' nervous system—are often insufficient triggers for ADHD task activation."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client is overwhelmed by their kitchen's mess. Using the 'Scaffolding for Cognitive Load' strategy, what is the most effective first step?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client to 'just start' with the hardest task to get it over with.",
                "Externalize the task by breaking it into 'micro-steps' and using visual cues like 'Point of Performance' reminders.",
                "Advise the client to wait until they feel motivated to clean the entire room.",
                "Remove all decorative items from the kitchen to minimize visual stimuli."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves externalizing the mental load. Breaking tasks into micro-steps reduces the demand on working memory and executive function, making the 'activation energy' lower."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism behind 'Task Paralysis' (or 'ADHD Paralysis') in the Prefrontal Cortex?",
            "options": [
                "An overactive motor cortex causing physical freezing.",
                "Cognitive 'overload' where the PFC cannot prioritize competing signals, leading to executive shutdown.",
                "A lack of physical energy or ATP in the muscle tissues.",
                "Intentional defiance of the required task (Oppositional Defiance)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Task paralysis occurs when the Prefrontal Cortex is overwhelmed by too many variables, instructions, or emotional weights, leading to an inability to select a starting point or 'ignite' action."

            "options": [
                "A mild preference for working alone.",
                "An intense, often unbearable emotional pain triggered by perceived or actual rejection or criticism.",
                "A personality disorder that requires long-term psychoanalysis.",
                "The inability to recognize social cues in a group setting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is a common ADHD trait involving extreme emotional sensitivity to the perception of being rejected or falling short of expectations, often linked to emotional dysregulation in the limbic system."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In the 'Empower Autonomy' phase, why is 'Body Doubling' an effective strategy for ADHD individuals?",
            "options": [
                "It provides a source of social pressure that increases cortisol.",
                "The presence of another person acts as an external 'anchor' for focus and reduces the 'activation energy' needed for a task.",
                "It allows the other person to do the work for the ADHD individual.",
                "It is a form of punishment for not completing tasks independently."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body doubling works by providing a calm, external presence that helps ground the ADHD individual, making it easier to stay on task and regulate the impulse to switch to more stimulating activities."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, age 32, feels 'shame spirals' when she forgets appointments. Which 'Validate & Regulate' intervention is most neuro-affirming?",
            "options": [
                "Reminding Sarah that everyone forgets things and she should try harder.",
                "Helping Sarah recognize that her forgetfulness is a symptom of working memory deficits, not a character flaw, and implementing a digital alert system.",
                "Suggesting Sarah spend 30 minutes a day reflecting on her failures to build 'mental toughness'.",
                "Assigning Sarah a strict manual planner and taking away her phone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A neuro-affirming approach validates the biological reality of the challenge (working memory) to reduce shame, then implements external scaffolds (digital alerts) to support the brain's needs."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which statement best reflects the 'Neuro-Affirming Paradigm' in ADHD support?",
            "options": [
                "ADHD is a broken brain that needs to be fixed to match neurotypical standards.",
                "ADHD is a different neurobiological wiring that requires specific environments and tools to thrive, rather than just 'trying harder'.",
                "ADHD is a lack of discipline that can be cured with the right rewards and punishments.",
                "ADHD symptoms are purely a result of modern technology and diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The neuro-affirming paradigm views ADHD as a natural variation in human neurobiology. Support focuses on environmental fit, strengths-based strategies, and accommodating needs rather than 'fixing' the person."
