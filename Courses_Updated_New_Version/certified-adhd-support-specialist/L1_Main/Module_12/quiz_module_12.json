            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which neurobiological phenomenon explains why individuals with ADHD often struggle to transition from 'daydreaming' to 'task-oriented' focus?",
            "options": [
                "The overactive amygdala suppressing the cerebellum",
                "Difficulty suppressing the Default Mode Network (DMN) when the Task Positive Network (TPN) is activated",
                "Excessive GABA production in the occipital lobe",
                "Hyper-connectivity between the hippocampus and the motor cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In ADHD brains, the Default Mode Network (mind-wandering) often fails to deactivate when the Task Positive Network (goal-directed focus) is engaged, leading to internal distraction and 'brain fog' during tasks."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "The 'ICNU' framework describes the four factors that activate the ADHD nervous system. What does the 'U' in ICNU stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Utility",
                "Uniformity",
                "Urgency",
                "Understanding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ICNU framework stands for Interest, Challenge, Novelty, and Urgency. These are the primary drivers of engagement for an interest-based nervous system, as opposed to importance or rewards."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to Dr. Russell Barkley's 'Point of Performance' concept, where should executive function scaffolding be placed for maximum efficacy?",
            "options": [
                "In a quiet therapy office during weekly sessions",
                "In a digital journal reviewed at the end of the day",
                "At the exact time and place where the behavior is expected to occur",
                "In a long-term rewards contract signed by the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD is a disorder of 'performance, not knowledge.' Therefore, supports (scaffolding) must be present at the 'point of performance'—the specific time and place the task needs to happen."

                "Laziness, apathy, and lack of intelligence",
                "Failure, rejection, shame, and anxiety",
                "Physical fatigue, hunger, and thirst",
                "Distraction, noise, and bright lights"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Wall of Awful' (coined by Brendan Mahan) is built from repeated negative emotional experiences—failure, rejection, shame, and anxiety—associated with a specific task."

            "id": "q12_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is an extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by the perception—not necessarily the reality—that a person has been rejected, teased, or criticized."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "When implementing 'Habit Stacking' for an ADHD client, what is the 'Anchor Habit'?",
            "options": [
                "The new, difficult habit the client wants to form",
                "A negative habit the client is trying to quit",
                "An existing, automatic behavior that serves as a trigger for the new habit",
                "A reward given only after the new habit is completed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking relies on using an 'anchor'—a behavior the client already does consistently (like brushing teeth or making coffee)—to trigger the new behavior."

        {
            "id": "q12_7",

                "A standard digital watch with a numeric display",
                "An analog clock or visual timer (like a Time Timer)",

                "A smartphone notification that pings every hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visual timers or analog clocks represent time as a 'volume' or 'space' that is disappearing, which helps ADHD individuals 'see' the passage of time more effectively than digital numbers."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Why is 'Body Doubling' an effective strategy for action initiation in ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "It provides a source of external dopamine and social urgency",
                "The second person does half of the work for the client",
                "It forces the client to explain their process out loud",
                "It triggers the fight-or-flight response to increase focus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Body doubling works by providing a 'calm presence' that reduces the emotional barrier to entry and creates a subtle sense of social urgency/accountability, which increases dopamine."

            "id": "q12_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Working memory is the 'mental workbench' that allows us to hold and manipulate information. It is frequently impaired in ADHD, leading to lost instructions or forgotten steps."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "In the THRIVE Support Plan, what is the primary goal of 'Environmental Restructuring'?",
            "options": [
                "To cure the underlying neurobiological dopamine deficiency",
                "To reduce the cognitive load required to perform daily tasks",
                "To eliminate the need for medication entirely",
                "To ensure the client never experiences a distraction again"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental restructuring (external scaffolding) aims to lower the 'barrier to entry' by reducing the amount of executive function and cognitive energy required to start and finish tasks."
