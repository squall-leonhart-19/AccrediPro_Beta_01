            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to developmental research (Barkley et al.), the executive function maturity of individuals with ADHD lags approximately 30-35% behind their chronological peers, which is critical when planning transitions to college or independent living."

                "The employer must provide any accommodation requested by the employee regardless of cost."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ADA mandates an 'interactive process,' which is a collaborative, ongoing communication between the employer and the employee to identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations."

                "Both partners have ADHD and struggle with impulse control."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Parent-Child dynamic is a common maladaptive pattern where the non-ADHD partner becomes the 'responsible one' (the parent) and the ADHD partner becomes the 'unreliable one' (the child), destroying intimacy and equality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen modulates dopamine. When estrogen levels drop during the luteal phase (pre-menses), dopamine levels also decline, often making ADHD symptoms more severe and reducing the effectiveness of stimulant medications."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Point of Performance' is the time and place where an individual must act. Scaffolding is most effective when it is physically located at that point (e.g., keeping medication on the coffee maker)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
