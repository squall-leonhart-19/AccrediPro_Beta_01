            "question": "In advanced neuro-biological profile tracing, what is the primary dysfunction observed in the 'Task Positive Network' (TPN) of an ADHD brain during task engagement?",
            "options": [
                "The TPN fails to adequately suppress the Default Mode Network (DMN), leading to internal 'noise' and distraction.",
                "The TPN becomes hyper-active, causing extreme focus that cannot be broken.",
                "The TPN and DMN perfectly synchronize, leading to a state of permanent flow.",
                "The TPN completely atrophies due to lack of dopamine in the cerebellum."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In ADHD brains, the 'anti-correlation' between the DMN (mind-wandering) and TPN (task-focus) is weak. This means the DMN stays active even when the person tries to focus, creating internal distractions."

            "question": "The 'INCUP' model identifies five motivators for the ADHD interest-based nervous system. What does the 'C' in INCUP stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Consistency",
                "Consequence",
                "Challenge",
                "Compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "INCUP stands for Interest, Novelty, Challenge, Urgency, and Passion. These are the five primary drivers that allow an ADHD brain to engage its dopamine system effectively."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "When implementing 'Environmental Engineering,' which of the following is an example of 'Low-Friction Scaffolding'?",
            "options": [
                "Placing a gym bag inside a locked closet to keep the room tidy.",
                "Using clear storage bins and removing cabinet doors to eliminate 'out of sight, out of mind' issues.",
                "Setting 15 different alarms on a phone located in another room.",
                "Creating a complex 10-step filing system for all household mail."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-friction scaffolding reduces the cognitive load required to complete a task. Visual cues like clear bins address the 'object permanence' challenges often found in ADHD profiles."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A client is experiencing 'Task Paralysis' despite having a clear to-do list. According to the Science of Initiation, what is likely missing?",
            "options": [
                "Sufficient willpower and discipline.",
                "A clear understanding of the long-term consequences.",
                "An 'Activation Bridge'—a high-dopamine or low-stakes entry point to break the freeze response.",
                "A more detailed 5-year plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Task paralysis is often a physiological 'freeze' response. An Activation Bridge (like a 5-minute 'dopamine prime' or micro-segmenting the first step) helps lower the activation energy required to start."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is characterized by an extreme emotional response that is often described as a 'Flash Flood.' Where does this response originate neurologically?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (Executive Function center)",
                "The Amygdala and Limbic System, bypassing the regulatory 'brakes' of the Prefrontal Cortex",

                "The Medulla Oblongata (Autonomic functions)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is an emotional dysregulation issue where the limbic system (the brain's emotional center) reacts intensely before the prefrontal cortex can 'rationalize' or regulate the response."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "In neuro-affirming habit building, why is 'Habit Stacking' more effective for ADHD brains than traditional habit formation?",
            "options": [
                "It relies on the brain's existing neural pathways (anchors) to trigger new behaviors, reducing the need for executive function.",
                "It punishes the user for forgetting a step.",
                "It requires the user to do five new habits at once.",
                "It eliminates the need for dopamine entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking uses an established 'anchor' (like brushing teeth) to trigger a new habit. This offloads the 'remembering to do it' from the executive function system to the basal ganglia."

                "Mandating that all communication be done via 30-minute phone calls."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body doubling is a zero-cost intervention that provides the social scaffolding many ADHD professionals need to maintain focus and initiation."

            "question": "What is the primary ethical boundary for a Certified ADHD Support Specialist when a client presents with severe, untreated clinical depression?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe a specific dosage of St. John's Wort.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Support specialists must recognize the 'Scope of Practice.' While they can support ADHD traits, clinical conditions like MDD require a referral to a licensed therapist or psychiatrist."

                "2,000",
                "5,000",

                "20,000"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Dr. William Dodson and other researchers estimate that children with ADHD receive 20,000 more negative messages by age 12, which heavily contributes to the development of RSD and low self-concept."

            "question": "A client wants to start a 'Morning Routine' but fails every day because they spend 2 hours on their phone in bed. Using 'Environmental Engineering,' what is the most effective intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Charging the phone in a different room and using a physical 'sunrise' alarm clock.",
                "Trying harder to use willpower to put the phone down.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Environmental Engineering focuses on changing the environment to make the 'wrong' thing harder and the 'right' thing easier. Moving the phone removes the immediate dopamine trap."
