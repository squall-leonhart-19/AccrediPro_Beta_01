            "question": "Which neurobiological mechanism explains why individuals with ADHD often experience emotional 'flooding' before they can logically process a situation?",
            "options": [
                "An overactive prefrontal cortex suppressing the limbic system",
                "A 'bottom-up' signaling dominance where the amygdala bypasses the weakened inhibitory control of the prefrontal cortex",
                "A lack of dopamine receptors in the visual cortex",
                "The complete absence of the Default Mode Network (DMN)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In ADHD, the structural and functional connectivity between the amygdala (emotional center) and the prefrontal cortex (executive control) is often impaired, leading to emotional responses that 'flood' the system before the brain can apply logical filters."

            "question": "Dr. William Dodson defines Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) primarily as:",

                "A gradual buildup of resentment over several months",
                "An intense, unbearable emotional pain triggered by the perception of rejection or failure",
                "A behavioral choice used to manipulate others into providing more attention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RSD is characterized by sudden, intense, and often physically painful emotional reactions to perceived or actual rejection, criticism, or failure, which are specific to the ADHD neurotype."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Shame Cycle' in ADHD is frequently reinforced by the 'Lazy' narrative. What is the most effective way to deconstruct this narrative in a coaching context?",

                "Encouraging the client to try harder and use a planner",
                "Differentiating between 'Moral Failing' and 'Executive Dysfunction' by explaining the Interest-Based Nervous System",

                "Suggesting the client spend more time around neurotypical high-achievers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deconstructing shame requires moving from a moral judgment (being 'lazy') to a functional understanding (executive dysfunction and the interest-based nature of the ADHD brain)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Physiological Sigh is a proven somatic tool that leverages the relationship between the diaphragm and the heart rate to quickly shift the body from a sympathetic (fight/flight) state to a parasympathetic (rest/digest) state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strengths-based reframing looks for the functional 'flip side' of a challenge; impulsivity, when regulated, manifests as spontaneity, courage, and rapid decision-making."

            "options": [
                "Because ADHD individuals lack the intelligence to meditate",
                "Because the ADHD brain's 'Default Mode Network' is often hyper-active, making quiet stillness feel like physical or mental torture",
                "Because mindfulness has been proven ineffective for neurodiversity",
                "Because ADHD brains require at least 60 minutes of silence to see any benefit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For many with ADHD, sitting still in silence causes the DMN to go into overdrive, leading to intrusive thoughts and 'itchy brain.' Adapted mindfulness (movement-based or micro-practices) is usually more effective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Many ADHD individuals use 'People Pleasing' as a compensatory strategy to avoid the pain of RSD. Boundary setting protects their limited cognitive and emotional energy from burnout."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Self-kindness (vs. self-judgment), common humanity (vs. isolation), and mindfulness (vs. over-identification) provide a framework for ADHD clients to accept their neurodivergence without self-loathing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The catastrophic interpretation of neutral stimuli is a hallmark of RSD-driven cognitive distortions, where the brain 'fills in the blanks' with the worst-case scenario regarding rejection."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest children with ADHD receive approximately 20,000 more negative messages or corrections by age 12 than their peers, which forms the foundational 'shame core' that persists into adulthood."
