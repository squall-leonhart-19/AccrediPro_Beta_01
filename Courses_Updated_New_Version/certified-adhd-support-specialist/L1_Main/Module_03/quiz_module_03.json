            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "According to the principle of Scaffolding in Lesson 1, why is environmental restructuring more effective than 'willpower' for ADHD clients?",
            "options": [
                "Willpower is a finite resource that relies on the prefrontal cortex, which is often underactive in ADHD.",
                "Environmental changes increase the client's IQ by reducing cognitive load.",
                "Willpower is a myth and does not exist in neurotypical or neurodivergent populations.",
                "Restructuring the environment is only effective if the client is also on stimulant medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Executive functions like willpower are managed by the prefrontal cortex. In ADHD, this 'fuel tank' empties quickly; scaffolding externalizes support so the brain doesn't have to work as hard to initiate tasks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client struggles with 'Out of Sight, Out of Mind' (Visual Persistence). Which environmental modification is most recommended in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "Moving all items into opaque, color-coded bins to reduce visual noise.",
                "Using clear storage containers and open shelving to keep items in the visual field.",
                "Storing all items in a central closet to minimize the number of rooms used.",
                "Labeling the outside of solid wooden drawers with small, handwritten stickers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visual persistence issues mean that if an item is not visible, the ADHD brain may 'forget' it exists. Clear containers and open shelving provide the necessary visual cues for task initiation and item retrieval."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3 on Sensory Architecture, what is the primary goal of minimizing 'Visual Friction'?",
            "options": [
                "To make the room look aesthetically pleasing for guests.",
                "To increase the amount of natural light in the workspace.",
                "To reduce the number of competing stimuli that trigger involuntary attention shifts.",
                "To ensure the client can see every single tool they own at all times."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visual friction (clutter) creates competing stimuli. For an ADHD brain with impaired sensory gating, every item in the visual field demands attention, leading to rapid cognitive fatigue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Regarding Digital Environment Hygiene (Lesson 4), what does the 'One-Click Rule' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The goal of having every important file accessible within one click from the desktop.",
                "Limiting social media usage to one click per hour.",
                "The requirement to delete any email that cannot be answered with one click.",
                "Ensuring that all notifications are turned off with a single master switch."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'One-Click Rule' aims to reduce 'digital friction.' The more clicks (steps) required to find a file or tool, the more opportunities there are for the ADHD brain to get distracted by something else."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the 'Point of Performance.' If a client consistently forgets to take their medication, where is the most effective place to store it?",
            "options": [
                "In a locked cabinet in the bathroom to ensure safety.",
                "In the kitchen cupboard next to the vitamins.",
                "Directly next to the item they use first in their morning routine (e.g., on top of the coffee maker).",
                "In a dedicated 'medical zone' in the home office."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Point of Performance dictates that support should be placed exactly where and when the behavior needs to occur. Placing medication where the morning routine begins reduces the 'executive gap' between the intention and the action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Why is 'Body Doubling' (Lesson 6) considered an effective social scaffold for productivity?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of another person provides a 'social anchor' that increases dopamine and accountability.",
                "The other person acts as a manager and gives direct instructions on what to do next.",
                "It forces the client to work in silence, which is always better for ADHD.",
                "It creates a competitive environment that triggers the 'fight or flight' response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Body doubling works by providing a 'social anchor.' The presence of another person—even if they are working on something else—helps regulate the ADHD brain's arousal levels and provides a subtle form of external accountability."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A 'Launch Pad' (Lesson 7) is a transition zone designed to solve which specific problem?",
            "options": [
                "The inability to fall asleep at night (insomnia).",
                "The 'frantic search' for essential items (keys, wallet, phone) when trying to leave the house.",
                "The tendency to hyperfocus on work tasks past dinner time.",
                "The difficulty of starting a workout routine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Launch Pad is a designated area near the exit where all 'outbound' items are kept. This prevents the working memory drain and emotional dysregulation caused by losing essential items right before a transition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, the 'Environmental Audit' is described as an 'iterative process.' What does this mean for the coach-client relationship?",
            "options": [
                "The coach should set the environment once and never change it.",
                "The client should be punished if the new environmental system fails within the first week.",
                "Systems must be constantly reviewed and adjusted based on what is actually working in practice.",
                "The audit is only successful if the client's house remains perfectly clean for 30 days."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iterative design acknowledges that the first solution might not be the best. An audit involves observing where the system broke down and 'tweaking' the environment to better fit the client's actual habits."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Research cited in the module suggests that visual distractions can be just as disruptive as auditory ones. How long does it typically take a person to regain deep focus after a significant distraction?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 2 minutes.",
                "Approximately 5-10 minutes.",
                "Approximately 23 minutes.",
                "Exactly 60 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as those from the University of California, Irvine) show it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to return to the original task after an interruption, highlighting the high cost of environmental distractions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Rule of Proximity' in the context of task initiation?",
            "options": [
                "The closer a tool is to the body, the more likely it is to be used.",
                "The closer a client lives to their workplace, the more productive they are.",
                "The idea that ADHD symptoms improve when standing close to a neurotypical peer.",
                "The requirement that all digital files must be stored on a local drive rather than the cloud."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Rule of Proximity states that task initiation is inversely proportional to the distance (and number of steps) required to access the necessary tools. Reducing physical distance reduces the 'activation energy' needed to start."
