            "question": "According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT) discussed in Lesson 1, which three innate psychological needs must be met to foster intrinsic motivation in ADHD individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Discipline, Consistency, and Reward",
                "Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness",
                "Focus, Executive Function, and Memory",
                "Accountability, Structure, and Compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-Determination Theory posits that Autonomy (feeling in control), Competence (feeling capable), and Relatedness (feeling connected) are the pillars of intrinsic motivation, which is essential for ADHD brains that struggle with extrinsic 'shoulds'."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Lesson 2 emphasizes 'Energy-First' planning. Why is this approach more sustainable for the ADHD brain than traditional time-blocking?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for a calendar entirely",
                "It focuses on the quantity of tasks rather than quality",
                "It accounts for the 'fluctuating capacity' of executive functions and dopamine levels",
                "It requires the client to work only when they feel motivated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD executive function is inconsistent. Energy-first planning acknowledges that a task requiring high cognitive load might be impossible during a 'low-dopamine' ebb, regardless of what the clock says."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 3's science of habit formation, what is the 'Friction Rule' for ADHD habit design?",
            "options": [
                "Increase friction for desired habits and decrease it for bad habits",
                "Friction is necessary to build mental 'muscle' and discipline",
                "Decrease friction for desired habits and increase friction for undesired habits",
                "Friction should be ignored in favor of stronger willpower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because the ADHD brain struggles with task initiation, reducing 'friction' (the number of steps or effort required to start) is critical for success. Conversely, adding steps to undesired habits helps bypass impulsive loops."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Transition Costs.' Which technique is specifically designed to reduce the executive load when moving from a high-dopamine task to a low-dopamine task?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Bridge' Activity (a 5-minute neutral buffer task)",
                "The 'Cold Turkey' Method (immediate cessation)",
                "The 'Reward-First' Strategy (eating a snack before stopping)",
                "The 'Double-Down' Technique (working twice as fast)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A 'Bridge' activity acts as a cognitive buffer, allowing the brain to de-escalate from a high-stimulation state before attempting a high-effort/low-reward task, reducing the 'switch cost' of transitions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A client struggles to tell their boss they need written instructions. Based on Lesson 5, which is the most effective self-advocacy formula?",
            "options": [
                "Demand: 'I have ADHD, so you must email me everything.'",
                "The 'Skill-Support' Link: 'I want to ensure I don't miss details; having a written summary helps me execute the task accurately.'",
                "The Apology: 'I'm sorry I'm so forgetful, could you please write that down?'",
                "The Deflection: 'I didn't do it because you didn't write it down.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective self-advocacy links the request (the support) to a positive outcome (the skill/result). This frames the accommodation as a tool for success rather than a demand for special treatment."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 introduces 'Micro-Mastery.' How does this concept combat the 'Learned Helplessness' often seen in ADHD adults?",
            "options": [
                "By forcing the client to master complex skills through repetition",
                "By providing external rewards for every small movement",
                "By accumulating 'evidence of competence' through tiny, undeniable wins",
                "By ignoring failures and only focusing on the future"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-mastery focuses on tasks so small they are 'impossible to fail.' This systematically rebuilds the client's self-efficacy by providing concrete evidence that they can follow through on their intentions."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "What is the primary function of the 'Personal Maintenance Manual' described in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "To serve as a medical record for doctors",
                "To externalize the client's self-knowledge and executive function strategies",
                "To provide a rigid set of rules that must be followed daily",
                "To track daily caloric intake and exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The manual is a 'living document' that externalizes what works for the client's unique brain (sensory needs, best tools, 'if-then' plans), reducing the cognitive load of 'remembering how to function' during stressful times."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A 2021 study on ADHD habit formation (referenced in Lesson 3) found that 'Implementation Intentions' increased task completion by what percentage compared to general goals?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "There was no measurable difference",
                "Between 20-30%",
                "Significant increases, often doubling the likelihood of follow-through"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions ('If [Situation] happens, then I will [Action]') significantly increase follow-through because they pre-load the decision-making process, bypassing the need for executive function at the moment of action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, the 'Path to Lifelong Autonomy' is described not as a straight line, but as a 'Spiral.' What does this mean for the client?",
            "options": [
                "That they will eventually return to their original symptoms and fail",
                "That progress involves revisiting similar challenges with higher levels of skill and self-awareness",
                "That the coaching process is circular and never truly ends",
                "That their symptoms will get worse before they get better"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The spiral model of progress acknowledges that 'setbacks' are actually opportunities to apply new tools to old problems. It reframes 'relapse' into 'research,' which is vital for long-term autonomy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "When designing a neuro-affirming routine (Lesson 2), which element is most likely to prevent the 'All-or-Nothing' failure cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Strict wake-up times",
                "A 'Minimum Viable Version' of the routine for low-energy days",
                "A system of financial penalties for missed days",
                "Removing all flexibility to ensure compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Minimum Viable Version' allows the client to maintain the 'habit of the habit' even on bad days. This prevents the shame-spiral that usually occurs when an ADHD person misses a day of a rigid routine."
