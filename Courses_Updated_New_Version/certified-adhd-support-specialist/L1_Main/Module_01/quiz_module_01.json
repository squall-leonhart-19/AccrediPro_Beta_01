            "question": "In the neurobiology of ADHD, what is the primary issue regarding the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Task Positive Network (TPN)?",
            "options": [
                "The TPN is overactive during rest, causing insomnia.",
                "The DMN fails to deactivate properly when the TPN is engaged, creating internal 'noise'.",
                "The DMN and TPN are fused, leading to hyperfocus at all times.",
                "The TPN is physically smaller in ADHD brains than in neurotypical brains."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In neurotypical brains, the DMN (mind-wandering) deactivates when the TPN (task-oriented) engages. In ADHD, this toggle switch is 'sticky,' meaning the DMN stays active, causing internal distractions even during tasks."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter pathway is most closely associated with the 'Reward Deficiency Syndrome' found in ADHD profiles?",
            "options": [
                "The Serotonergic pathway in the amygdala",
                "The GABAergic pathway in the cerebellum",
                "The Mesolimbic Dopamine pathway",
                "The Acetylcholine pathway in the hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Mesolimbic pathway is the brain's reward center. ADHD brains often have lower receptor sensitivity or lower baseline dopamine, leading to 'Reward Deficiency Syndrome' where everyday tasks provide insufficient stimulation."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client presents with high distractibility and poor follow-through but shows no signs of physical hyperactivity or impulsivity. According to the DSM-5-TR, which presentation is this?",
            "options": [
                "ADHD, Combined Presentation",
                "ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Presentation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Predominantly Inattentive Presentation is characterized by significant symptoms of inattention without the threshold of 5-6 symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which of the '8 Core Executive Functions' is responsible for the ability to hold information in mind while working with it, such as remembering a multi-step instruction?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Flexibility",
                "Response Inhibition",
                "Working Memory",
                "Task Initiation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Working Memory is the 'mental workbench' that allows us to hold and manipulate information. It is frequently impaired in ADHD, making multi-step directions difficult to follow."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Dr. William Dodson’s 'Interest-Based Nervous System' suggests that ADHD brains are NOT motivated by which of the following?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurotypical brains are motivated by Importance, Rewards, and Consequences. ADHD brains are primarily motivated by Interest, Challenge, Novelty, and Urgency (ICNU)."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "According to clinical statistics, approximately what percentage of adults with ADHD have at least one co-occurring psychiatric condition?",

                "Around 25%",
                "Approximately 50%",

                "Nearly 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as those by Barkley et al.) indicate that up to 80% of adults with ADHD have at least one comorbidity, such as anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders."

                "The tendency to blame others for ADHD-related mistakes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Masking involves using high cognitive effort to suppress ADHD symptoms (like fidgeting or interrupting) to appear neurotypical, often leading to extreme exhaustion and burnout."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "When using the DIVA-5 (Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults), why is it critical to investigate childhood history?",
            "options": [
                "Because ADHD can only be diagnosed if symptoms were present before age 12",
                "To determine if the client had a 'difficult' personality as a child",
                "To rule out the possibility of the client being a 'late bloomer'",
                "Because adult ADHD is a different disorder than childhood ADHD"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The DSM-5-TR requires evidence that several symptoms were present prior to age 12 to confirm the neurodevelopmental nature of the condition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Flexibility, or set-shifting, is the ability to transition between tasks or thoughts. Difficulty 'unhooking' from an activity is a hallmark of ADHD cognitive inflexibility."
