            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Universalization is a powerful group dynamic where members realize they are 'not the only ones,' which significantly reduces the toxic shame often associated with ADHD."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using a 'Parking Lot' validates the participant's contribution while maintaining the group's focus, and visual timers provide an objective boundary that reduces Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To be a sustainable business model, group programs should generate higher hourly revenue (2x-3x) than 1-on-1 work to cover the higher administrative and energy costs of group management."

                "12 is the minimum number of people needed for a group.",

            "explanation": "For deep, transformative work, a cap of 12 participants is often recommended to ensure everyone has 'air time' and to prevent the sensory/social overwhelm common in larger ADHD groups."
