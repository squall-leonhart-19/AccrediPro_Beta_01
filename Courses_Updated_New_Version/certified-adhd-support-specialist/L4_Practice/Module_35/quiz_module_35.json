            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social scaffolding in a group setting allows participants to support one another, which scales the impact of the specialist without requiring more 1-on-1 time."

            ],

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing questions in advance is a reasonable accommodation that allows neurodivergent candidates to demonstrate their actual competence rather than their ability to mask anxiety in real-time."
