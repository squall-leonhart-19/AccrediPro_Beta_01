            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to charge higher premium rates due to specialized expertise.",
                "It reduces the total number of clients the practitioner needs to track.",
                "It eliminates the need for professional liability insurance.",
                "It ensures the practitioner never has to refer clients to outside specialists."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Specialization allows a practitioner to position themselves as an expert in a specific sub-sector (e.g., ADHD for Entrepreneurs), which justifies premium value-based pricing and reduces marketing competition."

                "Co-creating a 'Body Doubling' schedule for a student client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Medication management and dosage adjustment are strictly clinical/medical acts that require a medical degree and licensure; doing so as a support specialist is a major legal and ethical violation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-inclusive marketing prioritizes clarity and reduces overwhelm. Minimalist design with clear, actionable steps helps clients with executive dysfunction make decisions without getting 'stuck.'"

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to work fewer hours for the same pay.",
                "It prevents the 'transactional' feel and focuses the client on long-term outcomes rather than the clock.",
                "It is the only pricing model allowed by most insurance companies.",
                "It requires less documentation and legal paperwork."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing can create anxiety for ADHD clients and encourages a 'per-session' mindset. Packaging focuses on the transformation and provides the predictable structure neurodivergent clients need."

            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "options": [
                "Because it penalizes the client for their symptoms.",
                "Because it provides the external structure and 'urgency' that helps the ADHD brain manage time effectively.",
                "Because it allows the practitioner to collect extra revenue.",
                "Because it is required by the International Coaching Federation (ICF)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clear boundaries and consequences provide 'scaffolding' for clients with time-blindness. Knowing there is a firm policy creates the necessary external dopamine/urgency to prioritize the appointment."

            "id": "q30_10",
            "question": "Lesson 5 suggests 'Scaffolding' your operations. Which of the following is an example of 'Externalizing' a practitioner's executive function?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalizing executive function means moving tasks from the brain to a system. Using a CRM automates the 'remembering' and 'organizing' phases of the business, protecting the practitioner's mental energy."
