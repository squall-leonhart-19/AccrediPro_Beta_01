            "options": [
                "It allows the specialist to charge lower rates to attract more volume",
                "It reduces the specialist's need for continuing education",
                "It solves the 'Generalist Paradox' where broad marketing fails to resonate with specific executive dysfunction challenges",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Generalist Paradox' suggests that by trying to help everyone with ADHD, you resonate with no one. Hyper-niching (e.g., ADHD in entrepreneurs) allows for specific, resonant messaging that addresses unique pain points."
