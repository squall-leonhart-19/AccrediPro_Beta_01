            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective facilitators manage group dynamics by gently but firmly redirecting dominant individuals, ensuring all voices are heard, and reinforcing positive group norms. Public shaming or ignoring the behavior is counterproductive."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For practical skills like mushroom identification, experiential learning methods such as a facilitated foraging walk (in-person) or a highly visual, interactive virtual demonstration are far more effective than passive lectures or reading, as they allow for direct observation and application."
