                "Explain that these are normal detoxification symptoms and encourage persistence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased anxiety and insomnia are potential signs of overstimulation, which can occur with Cordyceps in sensitive individuals or at higher doses. Reducing the dosage is a prudent first step to see if symptoms subside, indicating a dose-dependent reaction. Immediate cessation might be overly cautious unless severe, and adding another supplement without adjusting the primary one is not ideal. Dismissing symptoms as 'detox' without proper assessment is irresponsible."
