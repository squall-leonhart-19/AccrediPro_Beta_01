            "question": "A client expresses a desire for an 'overnight cure' for chronic fatigue using medicinal mushrooms. How should a Certified Medicinal Mushroom Specialist™ ethically address this expectation during goal elicitation?",
            "options": [
                "Affirm their belief, stating that mushrooms work quickly for many conditions.",
                "Explain the scientific basis of adaptogens, emphasizing gradual support for body systems and managing expectations for realistic timelines (e.g., 4-12 weeks for noticeable effects).",
                "Recommend the highest possible dosage to accelerate results and meet their expectations.",
                "Dismiss their concern, stating that their expectations are unrealistic and unachievable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice involves managing expectations by explaining the physiological mechanisms and typical timelines for efficacy (often 4-12 weeks for adaptogens), promoting realistic goal setting (Lesson 3)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Reishi is often considered an immunomodulator, its potential to stimulate immune activity warrants caution in autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's, as it could theoretically worsen symptoms for some individuals. This requires careful assessment and potentially avoiding strong immune stimulants (Lesson 5)."

                "It significantly increases the absorption rate of mushroom compounds, enhancing their effects.",
                "It can counteract the adaptogenic effects by continuously overtaxing the HPA axis, requiring higher dosages or more comprehensive lifestyle interventions.",
                "It has no measurable impact, as adaptogens work independently of stress levels.",
                "It converts the active compounds into inert substances, rendering the mushrooms ineffective."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress can continually activate the HPA axis, creating a physiological state that may overwhelm or diminish the balancing effects of adaptogens, necessitating a more holistic approach (Lesson 4)."
