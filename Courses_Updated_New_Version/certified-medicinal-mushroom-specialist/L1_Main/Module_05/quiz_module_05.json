                "This is a clear sign of an allergic reaction requiring immediate cessation of the mushroom.",
                "This is a common initial detoxification or adaptation response, observed in approximately <span class=\"stat-highlight\">25-30% of new Reishi users in a 2022 observational study</span>.",
                "It indicates that the dosage is too high and needs to be halved immediately to avoid adverse effects.",
                "This is likely a placebo effect, as Reishi has no known neurological impact on sleep or dreams."
