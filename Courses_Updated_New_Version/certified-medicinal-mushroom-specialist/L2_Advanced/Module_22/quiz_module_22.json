            "question": "A client expresses interest in using a novel mushroom, 'Amanita mirabilis,' for anxiety, citing anecdotal reports from social media. As a Certified Medicinal Mushroom Specialist, what is your primary ethical obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately recommend against its use due to lack of established safety data.",
                "Refer the client to a medical doctor for a formal diagnosis and treatment plan.",
                "Educate the client on the importance of evidence-based practice and discuss known safety profiles of established medicinal mushrooms.",
                "Research 'Amanita mirabilis' extensively and then provide a personalized recommendation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary ethical obligation is to guide clients towards evidence-based practices, ensuring they understand the difference between anecdotal claims and scientifically validated information. While referring to a medical doctor is appropriate for diagnosis, the specialist's role is to provide responsible, evidence-informed guidance on mushrooms. Researching a potentially unsafe mushroom to then recommend it would be outside the ethical scope."

            "question": "During a consultation, a client describes symptoms highly indicative of a serious medical condition, asking if a specific mushroom can 'cure' it. According to professional boundaries, what is the most appropriate response?",
            "options": [
                "State that you are not qualified to diagnose or treat medical conditions and strongly advise they consult a licensed medical practitioner.",
                "Suggest a general immune-boosting mushroom while emphasizing it's not a cure.",
                "Explain the potential benefits of the mushroom for the described symptoms, but avoid using the word 'cure.'",
                "Recommend they try the mushroom for a few weeks, then reassess their symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As a Certified Medicinal Mushroom Specialist, your scope of practice does not include diagnosing or treating medical conditions. It is an ethical imperative to maintain clear professional boundaries and refer clients to appropriate licensed healthcare providers for medical concerns, avoiding any claims of cure."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "Before recommending a specific mushroom protocol, a client seems hesitant and expresses concerns about potential side effects, despite your detailed explanation. What is the most ethical approach to ensure informed consent?",
            "options": [
                "Reassure them that side effects are rare and proceed with the recommendation.",
                "Provide them with additional scientific articles and studies to read at home.",
                "Pause the recommendation, explore their specific concerns, offer alternative options, and ensure they feel fully comfortable and understand all aspects before proceeding.",
                "Document their hesitation and proceed, noting they were informed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is an ongoing process that requires active engagement and respect for client autonomy. Ethically, you must address the client's specific concerns, ensure they feel heard and understood, and provide alternatives if necessary, rather than simply providing information or proceeding despite hesitation."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A client's spouse calls you, claiming their partner has given permission to discuss their medicinal mushroom protocol. You recall the client mentioning family support but did not obtain explicit written consent for information sharing. What is the ethically sound action?",
            "options": [
                "Share general information but avoid specific details.",
                "Politely decline to share any information and advise the spouse to have the client contact you directly to provide explicit consent.",
                "Ask the spouse to confirm the client's permission via text message.",
                "Share the information, assuming the client's verbal mention implies consent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality and privacy are paramount. Without explicit, preferably written, consent from the client specifically authorizing the sharing of their health information with a third party, you are ethically and legally obligated to decline sharing any details. Verbal mentions of family support do not constitute explicit consent for information disclosure."

            "question": "A new mushroom product claims to 'boost cognitive function by 50% in one week' based on testimonials. As a specialist committed to evidence-based practice, how should you evaluate such a claim?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the claim if the testimonials are numerous and positive.",
                "Seek peer-reviewed scientific studies (e.g., randomized controlled trials) demonstrating the effect size and mechanism, and scrutinize for potential biases.",
                "Recommend it to clients, but advise them that individual results may vary.",
                "Assume the claim is valid, as many natural products have undocumented benefits."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice requires critical evaluation of claims, prioritizing robust scientific evidence such as randomized controlled trials over anecdotal testimonials. Responsible specialists scrutinize methodology, effect sizes, and potential biases to ensure claims are substantiated and not misleading."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transparency is key when a conflict of interest exists. Ethically, you must disclose any financial ties to products you recommend. Presenting multiple options, including your own, after disclosure, allows the client to make an autonomous and informed decision, prioritizing their welfare over personal gain."

            "question": "You learn that a supplier of wild-harvested Reishi mushroom is operating in a region experiencing significant deforestation, and their harvesting practices are not certified sustainable. What is your ethical responsibility regarding this supplier?",
            "options": [
                "Continue using the supplier if their prices are competitive, as environmental issues are outside your direct control.",
                "Immediately cease purchasing from this supplier and seek out alternatives with verifiable sustainable sourcing certifications (e.g., organic, fair trade, forest stewardship).",
                "Advise the supplier to improve their practices, but continue purchasing in the interim.",
                "Prioritize product potency over sourcing ethics, as client results are paramount."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental ethics and sustainable sourcing are integral to responsible medicinal mushroom practice. Supporting unsustainable practices contributes to ecological harm.

While adverse effects can occur, you realize you haven't recently checked the supplier's third-party heavy metal testing results, which were last updated over a year ago. What is your immediate ethical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the client to reduce the dosage and monitor symptoms.",
                "Immediately contact the supplier for the most recent third-party lab results, specifically checking for contaminants like lead, cadmium, and mercury, and temporarily advise the client to pause usage until quality is re-verified.",
                "Dismiss the symptom as a minor digestive issue, unrelated to the product.",
                "Recommend a different Cordyceps brand without further investigation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Client safety and product quality control are paramount. Regular verification of third-party lab results for contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) is an ethical requirement. In such a situation, the immediate priority is to ensure the product's safety by obtaining up-to-date testing results and advising the client to pause usage as a precautionary measure."

            "question": "A client from an indigenous community expresses discomfort with your suggestion of a specific mushroom because it holds significant spiritual meaning in their culture, and they believe its use should be reserved for traditional healers. How should you respond with cultural sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "Explain that your approach is scientific and separate from spiritual beliefs.",
                "Dismiss their concerns, stating that the mushroom is widely available commercially.",

                "Suggest they consult their traditional healer first, then return for your scientific advice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural sensitivity requires acknowledging and respecting diverse beliefs and traditional knowledge systems. Ethically, a specialist should adapt their approach to align with the client's cultural values, apologize for unintentional disrespect, and work collaboratively to find alternatives that are culturally appropriate and comfortable for the client."

            "question": "A meta-analysis published in a reputable journal (e.g., *Journal of Ethnopharmacology*) indicates that a commonly recommended dosage for Reishi mushroom extract might be suboptimal for certain long-term immune support benefits, suggesting a higher effective dose than previously thought. What is your ethical responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Continue with the current dosage, as it has been generally accepted.",
                "Immediately inform all current clients to increase their dosage.",
