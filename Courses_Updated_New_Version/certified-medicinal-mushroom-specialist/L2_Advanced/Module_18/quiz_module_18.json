            "question": "A 62-year-old client with a history of atrial fibrillation is taking warfarin. They are interested in adding Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) for adaptogenic support. Based on Module 18, Lesson 2 on synergistic and antagonistic interactions, what is the primary concern the specialist should address?",
            "options": [
                "Reishi's potential to enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, increasing bleeding risk.",
                "Reishi's potential to reduce the efficacy of warfarin, increasing clotting risk.",
                "Reishi's interaction with beta-blockers, which are often co-prescribed with warfarin.",
                "Reishi's impact on blood pressure, which could destabilize the client's cardiovascular health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reishi, like many medicinal mushrooms, contains compounds (e.g., triterpenes) that may have mild anticoagulant properties. When combined with prescription anticoagulants like warfarin, there is a potential for an additive effect, increasing the risk of bleeding. This interaction is a critical consideration highlighted in Lesson 2 for client safety."

            "question": "A 48-year-old client, 10 years post-gastric bypass surgery, wishes to begin a medicinal mushroom protocol for general wellness and immune support. Based on Module 18, Lesson 1 (Advanced Client Assessment) and Lesson 5 (Delivery Methods), what is a crucial consideration for protocol design?",
            "options": [
                "Prioritize raw mushroom powders for maximum nutrient absorption.",
                "Recommend only dual-extracted tinctures due to altered digestion and absorption.",
                "Focus on mycelial biomass products as they are easier to digest.",
                "Suggest a combination of highly bioavailable extracts (e.g., tinctures, encapsulated extracts) and monitor for GI tolerance and nutrient status."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Gastric bypass surgery significantly alters digestion and nutrient absorption. Raw powders may be poorly absorbed, and even standard capsules might not be optimal.
