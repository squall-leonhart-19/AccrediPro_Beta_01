            "question": "Which of the following research designs is generally considered to provide the highest level of evidence for establishing causality in the context of medicinal mushroom efficacy?",
            "options": [
                "Expert opinion and anecdotal reports",
                "Case-control studies",
                "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)",
                "Cross-sectional surveys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for establishing causality due to their ability to minimize bias through randomization and control groups, thereby providing the highest level of evidence."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In a study investigating the effects of a Chaga mushroom extract on immune modulation, both the participants receiving the extract or placebo, and the researchers administering the treatments and assessing outcomes, are unaware of who is in which group. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Single-blinding",
                "Open-label design",
                "Double-blinding",
                "Cohort study"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Double-blinding occurs when neither the participants nor the researchers involved in the study know who is receiving the experimental treatment and who is receiving the placebo. This minimizes both participant and observer bias."

            "question": "A research paper on the anti-inflammatory properties of Turkey Tail mushroom is published in a journal that does not undergo a rigorous peer-review process, and the authors have significant financial ties to a company selling Turkey Tail supplements. These factors primarily raise concerns about the study's:",
            "options": [
                "External validity and generalizability",
                "Statistical power and sample size",

                "Ethical approval and informed consent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A lack of rigorous peer review and significant financial conflicts of interest directly threaten the internal validity of a study by increasing the potential for bias (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting, manipulation of results), making the findings less trustworthy."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A clinical trial reports that a specific Lion's Mane mushroom extract significantly improved cognitive function (p < 0.01) compared to placebo. However, the effect size (Cohen's d) was 0.15, and the average improvement on a cognitive test was only 2 points on a 100-point scale. This scenario highlights the crucial distinction between:",

                "Type I and Type II errors",
                "Clinical significance and statistical significance",

                "Internal and external validity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Statistical significance (p-value) indicates the likelihood that an observed effect is due to chance, while clinical significance refers to the practical importance or meaningfulness of an effect. A statistically significant result with a small effect size may not be clinically relevant."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Preclinical studies involving in vitro experiments or animal models are essential for understanding the mechanisms of action and initial safety profiles of medicinal mushroom compounds. However, a major limitation when interpreting these findings for human application is that:",
            "options": [
                "They often lack proper control groups",
                "They are always conducted by biased researchers",
                "Results from cell cultures or animal models do not always translate directly to human physiology and disease states",
                "They are too expensive to be widely accessible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While crucial, preclinical data from in vitro (cell culture) or in vivo (animal) studies do not always accurately predict human responses due to fundamental differences in biology, metabolism, and disease progression. Further human trials are always necessary."

            "options": [
                "Advise against its use entirely due to lack of Western scientific evidence",
                "Dismiss the traditional knowledge as unscientific",
                "Integrate the traditional knowledge, discuss the current evidence gaps transparently, monitor the client closely, and prioritize safety",
                "Recommend the mushroom without reservation, solely based on traditional claims"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An evidence-informed approach integrates traditional knowledge and real-world evidence while acknowledging the current scientific landscape. Transparent communication about evidence levels, close monitoring, and prioritizing client safety are paramount."

            "question": "A social media post claims that a proprietary blend of several medicinal mushrooms can 'detoxify the body completely' and 'prevent all chronic diseases,' citing vague testimonials and no scientific references. This claim exhibits several red flags of misinformation, including:",

                "Being published on a social media platform"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pseudoscience and misinformation often feature overly broad, unsubstantiated claims (e.g., 'cure all,' 'detoxify completely') and rely heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than robust, peer-reviewed scientific studies."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shared decision-making involves a collaborative process where the practitioner provides evidence-based information, and the client's values, preferences, and context are explicitly considered to arrive at a mutually agreed-upon treatment plan."

            "options": [
                "7% of patients will experience a complete remission of migraines",
                "For every 7 patients treated with the mushroom extract, one additional patient will benefit compared to the control group",

                "The treatment takes 7 weeks to show any effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is a measure of treatment effectiveness. An NNT of 7 means that, on average, 7 patients need to be treated with the intervention for one additional patient to experience the beneficial outcome that would not have occurred with the control treatment."

            "question": "A highly controlled randomized trial on the effects of Cordyceps on athletic performance was conducted exclusively on elite male endurance athletes. While the study's internal validity is strong, concerns arise about applying these findings to a general population of recreational female exercisers. This limitation primarily relates to:",
            "options": [
                "Internal validity",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "External validity (or generalizability) refers to the extent to which the findings of a study can be applied to other populations, settings, or conditions. A study conducted on a very specific demographic may not be generalizable to broader populations."
