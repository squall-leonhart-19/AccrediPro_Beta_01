            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "When interpreting a full thyroid panel, a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio of less than 20 (using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for rT3) most likely indicates which clinical state?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism",
                "Cellular T3 sequestration and impaired peripheral conversion",
                "Hyperthyroidism with T3 toxicosis",
                "Optimal thyroid hormone utilization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A FT3/rT3 ratio below 20 suggests that the body is shunting T4 into the inactive rT3 isomer rather than active T3, often due to systemic inflammation, high cortisol, or nutrient deficiencies."

        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "According to the HPT-HPA-HPG Triad model, how does chronic hypercortisolemia specifically affect thyroid hormone metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the NIS symporter to increase iodine uptake",
                "It downregulates 5'-deiodinase activity, inhibiting T4 to T3 conversion",
                "It increases the sensitivity of the TSH receptor",
                "It suppresses the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzymes (DIO1 and DIO2), which are responsible for converting T4 into the biologically active T3, leading to 'functional' hypothyroidism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Molecular mimicry by the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a significant factor in Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis because EBV antigens share structural homology with which thyroid component?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroglobulin (Tg)",
                "Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)",
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor (TSHR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that EBV nuclear antigens share amino acid sequences with Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO), leading to cross-reactive antibody production via molecular mimicry."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "A patient possesses a polymorphism (SNP) in the DIO2 gene (rs225014). Which clinical outcome is most commonly associated with this genetic variant?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated serum TSH levels above 10 mIU/L",
                "Reduced intracellular T3 levels in the brain and muscles despite normal serum labs",
                "Increased risk of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism",
                "Congenital absence of the thyroid gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DIO2 SNP affects the intracellular conversion of T4 to T3. Patients often present with hypothyroid symptoms and respond better to T3-containing medications, even when serum T4 and TSH appear 'normal'."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "In the context of advanced immunomodulation, which cytokine profile is characteristic of the Th17 dominance found in aggressive autoimmune thyroid tissue destruction?",
            "options": [
                "High IL-4 and IL-5",
                "High IL-10 and TGF-beta",

                "Low IFN-gamma and high IL-13"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Th17 cells produce IL-17 and are driven by IL-23; this pathway is highly inflammatory and is a primary driver of the parenchymal destruction seen in Hashimoto's."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "The 'Wolff-Chaikoff Effect' is a physiological phenomenon characterized by:",
            "options": [
                "A rapid increase in T3 production following selenium supplementation",

                "The upregulation of TSH receptors during pregnancy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is an autoregulatory mechanism where high iodine intake acutely inhibits the organification of iodine, temporarily slowing thyroid hormone production."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "T3 (Triiodothyronine) influences mitochondrial bioenergetics primarily by stimulating the expression of which 'master regulator'?",
            "options": [
                "Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB)",

                "Cortisol Binding Globulin (CBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 binds to nuclear receptors that upregulate PGC-1α, which in turn triggers mitochondrial biogenesis and increases the efficiency of the electron transport chain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "In complex case management, why must a practitioner address 'Adrenal Fatigue' or HPA axis dysfunction before introducing high doses of T3?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the 'Metabolic Crash' where cellular oxygen demand exceeds the body's delivery capacity",
                "T3 replacement will lower cortisol to dangerous levels",
                "Adrenal hormones are required for the absorption of T3 in the small intestine",
                "To prevent the autoimmune system from attacking the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Introducing T3 increases the basal metabolic rate and cellular oxygen demand. If the adrenals cannot produce sufficient cortisol to support this increased demand, the patient may experience a severe 'crash' or exacerbation of fatigue."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "How does 'Estrogen Dominance' (excessive estrogen relative to progesterone) typically interfere with thyroid hormone bioavailability?",
            "options": [
                "It destroys T4 molecules in the liver",
                "It increases the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), reducing the amount of Free T4/T3",
                "It blocks the TSH receptor in the pituitary",
                "It stimulates the rapid excretion of iodine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High estrogen levels stimulate the liver to produce more TBG. Because TBG binds thyroid hormones, the percentage of 'Free' (biologically active) hormones decreases, even if total hormone levels are normal."

        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is classified as an endocrine disruptor that affects the thyroid primarily by which mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA has a molecular structure that allows it to bind to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) on the cell nucleus, where it acts as an antagonist, blocking the actual T3 from exerting its metabolic effects."
