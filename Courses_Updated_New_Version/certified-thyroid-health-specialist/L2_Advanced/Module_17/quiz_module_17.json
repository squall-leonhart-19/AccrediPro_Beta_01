            "question": "In the 'Non-Responder' client, what is the primary enzymatic shift that leads to Low T3 Syndrome (Euthyroid Sick Syndrome)?",
            "options": [
                "Upregulation of D1 and D2 deiodinases",
                "Downregulation of D1/D2 and upregulation of D3 deiodinase",
                "Increased conversion of T3 to T2 in the pituitary",
                "Inhibition of the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low T3 Syndrome is characterized by a shift where the body decreases the activity of D1 and D2 (which produce active T3) and increases D3, which converts T4 into inactive Reverse T3 and T3 into T2."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client with refractory Hashimoto's and SIBO is not seeing improvements in TSH despite increasing medication doses. What is a likely gut-related mechanism for this?",
            "options": [
                "Bacterial deconjugation of T4-glucuronide by beta-glucuronidase producing bacteria",
                "Excessive production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) inhibiting the thyroid",
                "SIBO-induced hypochlorhydria increasing T4 solubility",
                "The 'leaky gut' allows T4 to bypass the liver entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In a healthy gut, about 20% of T4 is converted to T3 via deconjugation. In SIBO/dysbiosis, pathogenic bacteria can interfere with the enterohepatic circulation of thyroid hormones, often leading to malabsorption of oral medications."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "During the 'Perimenopause Pivot,' how does the relative decline in progesterone compared to estrogen (estrogen dominance) affect thyroid physiology?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG)",
                "It increases the production of TBG, lowering the amount of 'Free' thyroid hormone available to cells",
                "It stimulates the thyroid to produce more T4 to compensate for bone loss",
                "It inhibits the TPO enzyme directly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen stimulates the liver to produce more Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). High TBG binds more thyroid hormone in the blood, leaving less 'Free' T4 and T3 available for cellular use, even if total levels look normal."

                "Ergotamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a potent nephrotoxin and endocrine disruptor that has been shown to accumulate in the thyroid, causing oxidative damage and impairing mitochondrial ATP production required for hormone synthesis."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "For a client with recurrent miscarriage and positive TPO antibodies, what is the 'clinical sweet spot' for TSH levels during the first trimester recommended by many integrative specialists?",

                "TSH does not matter as long as Free T4 is high"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard ranges are broader, clinical guidelines and integrative practice suggest keeping TSH below 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester to reduce the risk of miscarriage, especially in antibody-positive women."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Cell Danger Response, as described by Dr. Robert Naviaux, shifts mitochondrial function from metabolism/energy production to cellular defense, which often results in systemic fatigue and 'hypothyroid-like' symptoms despite normal labs."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calcium carbonate, iron (ferrous sulfate), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are well-documented to significantly impair the absorption of T4 medication by altering gastric pH or binding the hormone in the gut."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the THRIVE™ framework, 'Immune Interrogation' involves looking beyond the thyroid to identify triggers like latent viruses, gut pathogens, or environmental toxins that are keeping the immune system in a state of chronic activation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hidden 'focal' infections, such as those found in the mouth (cavitations, root canals) or sinuses, are frequent 'root cause' drivers for persistent antibody elevation when other lifestyle factors have been addressed."

                "High TSH and Low Free T4",
                "Low TSH and High Free T4",

                "Normal TSH with Low Reverse T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Thyroid Hormone Resistance (RTH) is characterized by high circulating levels of T4 and T3, but the pituitary and peripheral tissues do not 'sense' them, leading to a TSH that remains elevated or normal instead of being suppressed."
