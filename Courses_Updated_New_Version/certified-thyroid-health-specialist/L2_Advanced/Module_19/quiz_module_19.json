            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Research on HPT axis dysregulation (L2) indicates that chronic elevation of cortisol has what specific effect on thyroid hormone metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the sensitivity of the TSH receptor",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, reducing T4 to T3 conversion",
                "It stimulates the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG)",
                "It accelerates the clearance of Reverse T3 (rT3)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical evidence shows that high cortisol levels suppress TSH secretion and inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into the active T3 hormone."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In the context of the Gut-Thyroid-Immune Axis (L3), what does the 'Molecular Mimicry' theory suggest regarding Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system reacts to foreign proteins (like those from certain gut bacteria or gluten) that have a similar sequence to thyroid tissue, leading to an autoimmune attack on the thyroid."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A 2019 study by Abbott et al. (L4) investigated the efficacy of the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet in women with Hashimoto's. What was a primary finding of this research?",

                "No clinical benefit was observed compared to a standard diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that while thyroid hormones (TSH/T4) didn't change significantly, participants experienced significant improvements in quality of life and a reduction in systemic inflammation markers like CRP."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple meta-analyses have shown that 200mcg of Selenium can reduce TPO antibody titers by 30-50% over a 3-6 month period in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 exerts a powerful influence on metabolism by upregulating PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby increasing the cell's capacity for ATP production."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "According to environmental toxicology research (L7), why are Fluoride and Bromide considered 'thyroid disruptors'?",
            "options": [
                "They stimulate the overproduction of TSH",
                "They increase the half-life of T4 in the bloodstream",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because they are in the same halogen group as Iodine, Fluoride and Bromide can compete for the same receptors (NIS) in the thyroid gland, effectively blocking iodine from entering the gland."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DIO2 SNP can result in reduced efficiency of the Type 2 deiodinase enzyme, leading to lower intracellular T3 levels even when serum TSH and T4 levels appear normal."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Precision medicine moves beyond 'one-size-fits-all' by using specific data points—such as SNPs (DIO2), gut health markers, and toxic load—to create individualized protocols for thyroid optimization."
