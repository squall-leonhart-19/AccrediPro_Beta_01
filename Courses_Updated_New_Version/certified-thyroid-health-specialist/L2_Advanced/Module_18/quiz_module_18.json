            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Methodology™, what does the 'R' stand for, and what is its primary focus within the framework?",
            "options": [
                "Recalibrate Hormones; focused on adjusting synthetic T4 dosages.",
                "Restore Root Cause Resilience; focused on addressing systemic triggers like gut dysbiosis and HPA axis dysfunction.",

                "Rapid Recovery; focused on high-dose supplementation for immediate symptom relief."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in T.H.R.I.V.E. stands for Restore Root Cause Resilience, emphasizing the need to fix the underlying systems (like the gut or adrenals) that allow the thyroid to function optimally."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'normal' TSH of 1.8 mIU/L but a Free T3/Reverse T3 ratio of 10 (using pg/mL and ng/dL). What does this synergy most likely indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal thyroid function and peripheral conversion.",
                "Primary hypothyroidism requiring immediate T4 monotherapy.",

                "Hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' Disease."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low fT3/rT3 ratio (typically below 20 in standard units) suggests that while the pituitary (TSH) is satisfied, the peripheral tissues are converting T4 into the inactive rT3, leading to cellular-level symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Root Cause Layering' principle, which system should typically be stabilized first to reduce the 'Total Toxic Load' before introducing metabolic stimulants?",
            "options": [
                "Mitochondrial Biogenesis",
                "Thyroid Hormone Replacement",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic layering requires stabilizing the gut and blood sugar first to reduce systemic inflammation (cytokines), which otherwise inhibits thyroid hormone conversion and receptor sensitivity."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "The Neuro-Endocrine Bridge (HPT-HPA) explains that chronic elevation of cortisol inhibits which specific enzyme, leading to 'Low T3 Syndrome'?",

                "HMG-CoA Reductase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels suppress the deiodinase enzymes responsible for converting T4 into the active T3, while simultaneously increasing the activity of the enzyme that creates rT3."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "Which inflammatory cytokine is specifically highlighted in Lesson 5 for its ability to downregulate Thyroid Hormone Receptors (TR), making the body 'deaf' to thyroid signals?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "IL-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that can reduce the expression and sensitivity of thyroid hormone receptors, leading to symptoms even when blood levels appear normal."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "In Metabolic Optimization (Lesson 6), what is the primary role of Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) in supporting a thyroid patient?",
            "options": [
                "Acting as a precursor to T4 hormone.",

                "Increasing the half-life of synthetic Levothyroxine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PQQ is unique because it stimulates the signaling pathways that lead to mitochondrial biogenesis, which is essential for thyroid patients who have 'sluggish' cellular energy production."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase; without it, the hydrogen peroxide produced during iodine processing can damage the thyroid gland and trigger an autoimmune (Hashimoto's) flare."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "Case Study Synthesis: A client has Ferritin of 22 ng/mL and TSH of 3.5. Why must iron be addressed before judging the 'true' TSH level?",
            "options": [
                "Iron is needed for the TPO enzyme to synthesize thyroid hormone.",
                "Iron is required for the transport of T3 into the nucleus.",
                "Low iron increases Reverse T3 production.",
                "All of the above."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Iron deficiency (Ferritin <30-50 ng/mL) impairs TPO activity, reduces T4-T3 conversion, and increases rT3, making it a primary bottleneck in thyroid synthesis."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "What is the 'Nutrient Sequencing' rule regarding HPA axis support and Thyroid support?",

                "Always start with high-dose T3 before checking the adrenals.",
                "Support the HPA axis and adrenal resilience *before* or *simultaneously* with thyroid support to prevent 'metabolic crashes'.",
                "Adrenals should only be addressed if the client has a TSH over 10.",
                "Supplementation order does not matter as long as the total dose is correct."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supporting the thyroid (the 'gas pedal') without supporting the adrenals (the 'engine/buffer') can lead to increased anxiety, heart palpitations, and 'burnout' as the body cannot handle the increased metabolic demand."

            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 8's Case Study Synthesis, what marker was used to confirm that the client's 'brain fog' was metabolic rather than just psychological?",

                "Elevated LDL-C despite a clean diet.",
                "High Reverse T3 and low Free T3.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, the synthesis of elevated cholesterol (metabolic slowdown), poor T3 conversion (cellular energy deficit), and high CRP (neuro-inflammation) confirms a multi-system metabolic root cause."
