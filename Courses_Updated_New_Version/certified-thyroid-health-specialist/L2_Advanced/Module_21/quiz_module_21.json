            "question": "According to the 'Order of Operations' in Thyroid Care (Lesson 2), which physiological system must be stabilized BEFORE aggressive thyroid hormone optimization to prevent 'metabolic crashing'?",
            "options": [
                "Heavy metal detoxification and chelation",
                "Blood sugar regulation and HPA-axis stability",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols",
                "Aggressive iodine supplementation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilizing blood sugar and the HPA-axis (adrenal function) is foundational. Attempting to 'rev' the metabolic engine with thyroid hormones while the foundation is unstable often leads to increased anxiety, insomnia, or a 'crash' as the body cannot support the increased metabolic demand."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Sequencing Strategy (Lesson 3), what does the 'R' represent, and why is it prioritized in Phase 2?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid Weight Loss; to improve client motivation",
                "Restoration of Gut Integrity; to address the 70-80% of the immune system located in the GALT",
                "Replacement of T4; because T4 is the primary storage hormone",
                "Reduction of Stress; to lower cortisol immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restoration of Gut Integrity is critical because the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) houses the majority of the immune system. Addressing intestinal permeability (leaky gut) is essential for reducing the molecular mimicry that drives Hashimoto's antibodies."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "A 2017 study highlighted in Lesson 4 demonstrated that combining Selenium with which other nutrient led to a more significant reduction in TPO antibodies and improved TSH levels than Selenium alone?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium Glycinate",
                "Myo-inositol",
                "Zinc Picolinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of Selenium (83 mcg) and Myo-inositol (600 mg) has been shown in clinical trials to significantly lower TSH and TPO antibodies more effectively than selenium alone by improving thyrocyte sensitivity to TSH."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When replenishing vital nutrients (Lesson 5), what is the 'Optimal' ferritin range required for efficient thyroid hormone utilization and hair follicle stimulation, as opposed to the 'Standard' lab range?",
            "options": [
                "10–20 ng/mL",
                "30–50 ng/mL",
                "70–100 ng/mL",
                "Over 300 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While standard lab ranges consider ferritin 'normal' as low as 12-15 ng/mL, thyroid experts and trichologists identify 70-100 ng/mL as the optimal range for thyroid hormone signaling and preventing telogen effluvium (hair thinning)."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "During Clinical Synthesis (Lesson 1), you identify a T3/rT3 ratio of 8 (using pg/mL and ng/dL). What does this most likely indicate regarding the client's metabolic state?",
            "options": [
                "Excellent peripheral conversion of T4 to T3",
                "Cellular hypothyroidism due to excessive 'braking' by Reverse T3",
                "Hyperthyroidism requiring immediate medication reduction",
                "A healthy adaptation to a ketogenic diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A T3/rT3 ratio below 10 (when using pg/mL for T3) or 20 (when using ng/dL for T3) suggests that the body is diverting T4 into the inactive rT3 'brake' rather than the active T3 'gas,' indicating cellular hypothyroidism despite 'normal' TSH."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 (Metabolic Resuscitation), how does chronic caloric restriction (below BMR) specifically impact the deiodinase enzymes?",
            "options": [
                "It increases D1 activity to speed up metabolism",
                "It has no effect on enzyme activity",
                "It downregulates D1 and D2 while upregulating D3, leading to lower Free T3",
                "It increases the conversion of T3 back into T4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic undereating signals a 'famine' state to the body, which downregulates the D1 and D2 enzymes (which produce T3) and upregulates D3 (which produces rT3), effectively slowing the metabolic rate to preserve energy."

        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on Medication Management, which of the following substances can reduce the absorption of Levothyroxine by up to 30-50% if taken within 60 minutes of the medication?",
            "options": [
                "Black coffee and Calcium supplements",
                "Distilled water",
                "Vitamin D3 drops",
                "Probiotics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Calcium, Iron, and coffee are notorious for interfering with T4 absorption. Clients should wait at least 60 minutes before drinking coffee and 4 hours before taking calcium or iron supplements."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "A client has reached a plateau (Lesson 8). Their labs are optimal, but they still experience profound fatigue and brain fog. Which 'Hidden Barrier' should be investigated first based on the module's troubleshooting framework?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of willpower",
                "Environmental triggers such as Mold/Mycotoxins or Occult Infections (EBV/Lyme)",
                "Insufficient cardiovascular exercise",
                "Low dietary fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When thyroid labs are optimized but symptoms persist, the practitioner must look for 'cell danger response' triggers, such as mycotoxins, heavy metals, or chronic low-grade infections like Reactivated EBV, which keep the body in a defensive, low-energy state."

        {
            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) is discussed as an advanced strategy for antibody reduction. What is its primary mechanism of action in Hashimoto's?",
            "options": [
                "It kills the bacteria that cause Hashimoto's",
                "It acts as a direct replacement for T3",
                "It upregulates endorphins and modulates the immune system by binding to opioid growth factor receptors",
                "It suppresses the thyroid gland to allow it to rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LDN works by briefly blocking opioid receptors, causing the body to increase production of met-enkephalin and endorphins, which helps normalize the Th1/Th2 immune balance and reduce TPO/TgAb antibodies."

        {
            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "Phase 1 of the T.H.R.I.V.E. strategy focus on 'Toxins and Triggers.' Why is it contraindicated to start a 'Deep Liver Detox' in the first 2 weeks of a thyroid protocol?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive for most clients",
                "The body requires sufficient ATP and glutathione (Phase 5/6) to safely conjugate and excrete toxins; otherwise, 're-tox' occurs",
                "Detoxification has no impact on thyroid health",
                "Liver detox always causes permanent thyroid damage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Detoxification is an energy-intensive process. If a client is metabolically depleted (low T3) and has poor elimination pathways (constipation), a deep detox will mobilize toxins that the body cannot excrete, leading to a systemic inflammatory flare."
