            "question": "When assessing the 'Advanced Thyroid Panel,' what is the clinical significance of an elevated Reverse T3 (rT3) despite a 'normal' TSH?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates a primary autoimmune attack on the thyroid gland.",
                "It suggests the body is shunting T4 into an inactive form due to systemic stress, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies.",
                "It is a definitive marker for hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease.",
                "It confirms that the pituitary gland is overproducing TSH."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 acts as a 'brake' on the metabolism; high levels indicate that the body is preserving energy by converting T4 into inactive rT3 rather than active T3, often due to high cortisol, inflammation, or illness."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Functional vs. Pathological Ranges,' what is the generally accepted 'Optimal' functional range for TSH in a healthy adult?",
            "options": [
                "0.45 to 4.5 mIU/L",
                "1.0 to 5.5 mIU/L",
                "0.5 to 2.0 mIU/L",
                "3.0 to 4.0 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While lab 'normal' ranges often go up to 4.5 or 5.0, functional medicine practitioners look for a tighter range (0.5 - 2.0 mIU/L) where patients typically report the best symptom resolution."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "Which antibody is considered the most sensitive marker for Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, appearing elevated in approximately 90-95% of cases?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI)",
                "Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb)",
                "Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody (TPOAb)",
                "TSH Receptor Antibody (TRAb)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TPOAb is the most common antibody found in Hashimoto's, as it targets the enzyme responsible for iodinating tyrosine residues in the thyroid."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Adrenal Cross-Talk, how does chronic high cortisol (hypercortisolemia) specifically interfere with thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the sensitivity of thyroid receptors.",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which converts T4 into active T3.",
                "It stimulates the thyroid to produce excess T1 and T2.",
                "It lowers the production of Reverse T3."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels suppress the conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues by inhibiting the deiodinase enzymes, leading to 'functional hypothyroidism' despite normal TSH."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "When using Basal Body Temperature (BBT) as a metabolic assessment tool (Barnes' Protocol), which temperature range (taken before rising) is suggestive of hypothyroidism?",

                "Consistently above 98.6°F (37.0°C)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dr. Broda Barnes established that a waking temperature consistently below 97.8°F is a clinical indicator of low metabolic rate and potential hypothyroidism."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' thyroid labs but hair loss and fatigue. You find their Ferritin is 22 ng/mL. Why is this significant for thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "Ferritin has no impact on thyroid hormone.",
                "Optimal thyroid hormone utilization at the cellular level requires Ferritin levels of at least 70-100 ng/mL.",
                "Low ferritin increases the conversion of T4 to T3.",
                "Low ferritin only matters if the TSH is above 10.0."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron (measured via Ferritin) is a required co-factor for TPO activity and for the effective transport and binding of T3 to nuclear receptors."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses the Gut-Thyroid Axis. Approximately what percentage of T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the gut via the enzyme intestinal sulfatase?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "About 20% of T4 is converted to T3 in the GI tract, specifically into T3S (T3 sulfate) and T3AC (triiodothyroacetic acid), which requires a healthy microbiome for activation."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Which group of toxins is known for 'Halogen Displacement,' where they compete with Iodine for uptake in the thyroid gland?",
            "options": [
                "Lead and Mercury",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, Bromide, and Chlorine are in the same halogen family as Iodine and can bind to thyroid receptors, blocking iodine and disrupting hormone synthesis."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "In a case study where a client has high TPO antibodies and high TSH, but 'normal' Free T4 and Free T3, what is the correct clinical classification?",
            "options": [
                "Overt Hypothyroidism",

                "Euthyroid Sick Syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH with normal peripheral hormones; the presence of antibodies confirms it is the autoimmune (Hashimoto's) variant."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Why is Selenium screening vital in the 'Nutrient Replenishment Matrix' for thyroid patients?",
            "options": [
                "It is the primary component of the T4 molecule.",
                "It neutralizes the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced during T3 synthesis, protecting the gland from oxidative damage.",
                "It is required to stimulate the pituitary to release TSH.",
                "It prevents the absorption of dietary fats."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a component of glutathione peroxidase, which protects the thyroid from the oxidative stress generated by TPO during the iodination process."
