            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "According to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines discussed in Lesson 1, what is the recommended upper limit for TSH during the first trimester of pregnancy to minimize the risk of neurocognitive deficits in the offspring?",
            "options": [
                "1.0 mIU/L",
                "2.5 mIU/L",
                "4.0 mIU/L",
                "5.5 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To optimize fetal brain development and reduce miscarriage risk, the TSH should ideally be maintained below 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester, as the fetus is entirely dependent on maternal T4 during this period."

        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "In the 'triphasic' presentation of Postpartum Thyroiditis (Lesson 2), which phase typically occurs between 1 and 4 months postpartum and is often misdiagnosed as 'new mother anxiety'?",
            "options": [
                "The Hypothyroid Phase",
                "The Euthyroid Recovery Phase",
                "The Thyrotoxic Phase",
                "The Permanent Hypothyroidism Phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Thyrotoxic phase occurs first (1-4 months postpartum) due to the release of preformed thyroid hormone from inflamed tissue. It is frequently mistaken for postpartum anxiety or sleep deprivation."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "When managing Pediatric Thyroid Disorders (Lesson 3), why is maintaining Free T4 in the upper half of the reference range considered more critical than in adults?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent childhood obesity",
                "To ensure optimal myelination and synaptic plasticity during critical growth windows",
                "To prevent the early onset of puberty",
                "To manage insulin sensitivity in toddlers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In pediatrics, thyroid hormones are essential for neurological development (myelination). Even mild deficiencies can lead to permanent IQ deficits and impaired growth velocity."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In geriatric patients (Lesson 4), a TSH of 6.5 mIU/L in an 85-year-old patient with no clinical symptoms is often viewed as:",
            "options": [
                "An urgent indication for Levothyroxine therapy",
                "A physiological adaptation to aging that may be cardioprotective",
                "A sign of occult thyroid malignancy",
                "A result of iodine deficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that the TSH distribution shifts higher with age. In the very elderly (80+), subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH < 7-10) is often associated with increased longevity and does not always require treatment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Which specific hormonal pattern is hallmark of 'Non-Thyroidal Illness Syndrome' (NTIS) commonly seen in elite athletes suffering from Overtraining Syndrome (Lesson 5)?",
            "options": [
                "High TSH, High Free T4, Low Free T3",
                "Low TSH, Low Free T4, Low Free T3",
                "Normal/Low TSH, Low Free T3, High Reverse T3",
                "High TSH, Low Free T4, Normal Free T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NTIS in athletes involves a 'down-regulation' of the HPT axis where TSH is inappropriately normal or low, Free T3 drops to conserve energy, and Reverse T3 increases to block metabolic activity."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) caused by mold/mycotoxins (Lesson 6), which hormone is typically suppressed, leading to a secondary 'down-regulation' of the thyroid?",
            "options": [
                "MSH (Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone)",
                "Cortisol",
                "Progesterone",
                "Oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mycotoxins damage the hypothalamus, leading to low MSH. Low MSH results in dysregulated TSH production and reduced ADH, explaining why CIRS patients often have thyroid symptoms despite 'normal' labs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, how does Hyperinsulinemia in PCOS patients directly impair thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the destruction of the thyroid gland",
                "It increases the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG)",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, impairing T4 to T3 conversion",
                "It increases iodine excretion in the kidneys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin resistance and high insulin levels can inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 into the active T3, leading to 'cellular hypothyroidism' even if TSH is within range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Method™ (Lesson 8), the 'R' stands for Root Cause Resolution. In a case study involving a patient with high TPO antibodies and chronic bloating, which root cause should be investigated first?",
            "options": [
                "Heavy metal toxicity",
                "Intestinal permeability (Leaky Gut) and dysbiosis",
                "Adrenal fatigue",
                "Genetic SNPs (MTHFR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the 'bloating' symptom and high antibodies, the T.H.R.I.V.E. method prioritizes the gut-thyroid axis (Molecular Mimicry) as the primary root cause to address."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "What is the WHO-recommended daily iodine intake for pregnant and lactating women to prevent neonatal cretinism and developmental delays?",
            "options": [
                "150 mcg",
                "250 mcg",
                "500 mcg",
                "1000 mcg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The requirement for iodine increases significantly during pregnancy to support increased maternal T4 production and fetal needs; the WHO recommends 250 mcg daily."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A 32-year-old female athlete presents with amenorrhea, low Free T3 (2.1 pg/mL), and a TSH of 1.2 mIU/L. Her Reverse T3 is elevated. What is the most likely clinical integration (Lesson 5 & 8)?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism",
                "Graves' Disease",
                "Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)",
                "Hashimoto's Encephalopathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This pattern (amenorrhea + low T3 + normal TSH + high rT3) is the classic 'Thyroid Sick Syndrome' profile of RED-S, where the body shuts down non-essential functions due to caloric insufficiency."
