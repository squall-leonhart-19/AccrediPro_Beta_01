            "options": [
                "Thyroid hormone replacement and Heavy metal detox",
                "Thyroid Support and Hormonal/Circadian Rhythm stabilization",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 (T & H) focuses on Thyroid support through foundational nutrition and Hormonal/Circadian rhythm stabilization to lower systemic stress before addressing root causes."

                "A BMI over 30 with no other clinical markers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients with TSH > 10 mIU/L or pre-existing cardiac conditions are stratified as High Complexity due to the risk of cardiovascular strain during metabolic up-regulation."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "In Phase 2: Root Cause & Inflammation Clearance (R & I), what is the primary objective regarding gut health?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' and 'I' phase focuses on identifying Root causes like gut dysbiosis and removing Inflammatory triggers to reduce the autoimmune burden and systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, which nutrient triad is most critical for optimizing the T4 to T3 conversion during Phase 3 (Vitality & Energy)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium and Zinc are essential cofactors for deiodinase enzymes, while controlled Iodine support is introduced in Phase 3 once the system is stabilized and inflammation is low."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "When differentiating between Autoimmune (Hashimoto's) and Non-Autoimmune programs (L6), what is the standard protocol regarding iodine introduction?",
            "options": [
                "Hashimoto's clients should start with high-dose Lugol's solution immediately",
                "Non-autoimmune hypothyroid clients require a total lifetime avoidance of iodine",
                "Hashimoto's clients require a 'Seal the Gut' approach and antioxidant support (like Selenium) before any iodine introduction",
                "There is no difference in protocol between the two types"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Hashimoto's, introducing iodine too early can trigger a 'flare' or oxidative stress. The gut must be supported and antioxidant status (Selenium) optimized first."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Flatline' Basal Body Temperature (BBT) chart, where temperatures remain consistently low (e.g., 96.8°F) with no mid-cycle rise. What does this data pivot suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The client is over-training and requires more cardio",
                "The client has achieved metabolic mastery",
                "Anovulation or severe metabolic suppression, requiring a return to Phase 1 stabilization",
                "The client needs to reduce their caloric intake immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flatline, low BBT chart typically indicates a lack of progesterone (no mid-cycle rise) and overall low metabolic rate, signaling that the client is not ready to progress to more intensive phases."

        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "What is the 'Rule of 30' used in the Tracking Mastery lesson (L7) for determining program progression?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 30% reduction in the TSS indicates that the client's foundational stress and inflammation have decreased enough to handle the 'Root Cause' work of Phase 2."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8: Program Scaling, what is the primary benefit of the 'Hybrid Delivery Model' for a Thyroid Specialist?",

                "It allows the coach to prescribe medication legally",
                "It combines 1-on-1 deep dives with group-based curriculum to increase impact and profitability",
                "It eliminates the need for any client intake forms",
                "It focuses exclusively on selling supplements rather than coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid model allows for the personalization needed in thyroid cases (1-on-1) while using group modules for the educational components, increasing efficiency and scaling."

                "Discontinue the program as it is not working"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If markers improve but symptoms (energy) lag, the specialist should investigate secondary root causes like occult infections or environmental toxins that continue to drain metabolic power."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "Which clinical marker is considered the 'Gold Standard' for tracking metabolic speed in the THRIVE framework?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While labs are important, BBT and RHR provide real-time data on cellular metabolic activity and how well the body is actually utilizing thyroid hormone."
