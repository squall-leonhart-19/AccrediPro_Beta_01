            "question": "In Lesson 1, a 'Non-Responder' is defined as a client who does not see clinical improvement despite 'optimal' lab values. What is the first triage step when cellular resistance is suspected?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the dose of T4-only medication immediately",
                "Assess for systemic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction markers",
                "Switch the client to a desiccated thyroid extract (NDT) without further testing",
                "Recommend a high-intensity aerobic exercise program to 'jumpstart' metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When labs look 'optimal' but the client feels poorly, the practitioner must look at cellular-level issues like inflammation, which can block receptor sensitivity, or mitochondrial dysfunction."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "Regarding the Thyroid-Adrenal-Ovarian (TAO) Axis, how does progesterone deficiency (common in perimenopause) directly impact thyroid physiology?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a direct increase in TSH production from the pituitary",
                "It leads to 'estrogen dominance,' which increases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), lowering free hormone levels",
                "It stimulates the rapid conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver",
                "It inhibits the production of Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) antibodies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone helps keep TBG levels in check. When progesterone is low, relative estrogen dominance increases TBG, which binds more thyroid hormone, leaving less 'Free' hormone available for the cells."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Stealth Pathogens.' Which mechanism describes how Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) contributes to Hashimoto's through molecular mimicry?",
            "options": [
                "The virus directly eats thyroid tissue as a food source",
                "The virus prevents the absorption of Selenium in the gut",
                "The immune system confuses viral proteins with thyroid peroxidase (TPO) due to structural similarities",
                "EBV only affects the adrenals, never the thyroid gland directly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system identifies a sequence of amino acids on a pathogen that looks identical to a sequence on the thyroid gland, leading to accidental 'friendly fire' on the thyroid."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "In the context of CIRS (Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), what percentage of the population carries the HLA-DR 'multi-susceptible' gene that prevents the body from identifying and clearing biotoxins?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 2%",
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "About 25% of the population carries the HLA-DR genetic susceptibility, making them unable to effectively clear toxins from mold (biotoxins) or Lyme, leading to chronic systemic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "During an acute Hashimoto’s flare-up, which of the following is a 'Crisis Protocol' priority addressed in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing iodine supplementation to 12.5mg daily",
                "Implementing a 'calm and clear' strategy: removing all potential dietary triggers and utilizing high-dose antioxidants like Glutathione",
                "Switching to a ketogenic diet with 80% fat content immediately",
                "Performing a heavy metal detox using EDTA chelation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flare management requires calming the immune system. High-dose antioxidants like Glutathione or NAC help quench the oxidative stress (H2O2) produced during TPO activity."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A client reacts poorly to every brand of levothyroxine tablet but tolerates Tirosint (a gel cap). Based on Lesson 6, which excipient is a common culprit for GI-sensitive thyroid patients?",
            "options": [
                "Distilled water",
                "Acacia or Lactose fillers",
                "Gelatin",
                "Glycerin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many thyroid tablets use lactose or acacia (gum arabic) as fillers. Patients with SIBO or lactose intolerance often react to these excipients, making 'clean' versions like Tirosint or compounded meds necessary."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "Hashimoto’s Encephalopathy (SREAT) is a rare but serious neurological complication. What is a defining clinical characteristic of this condition?",
            "options": [
                "It only occurs when TSH is above 100 mIU/L",
                "It is characterized by high anti-thyroid antibodies and a dramatic positive response to corticosteroid treatment",
                "It is caused by a lack of Vitamin D and cannot be treated with medication",
                "It results in permanent memory loss that never improves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SREAT (Steroid-Responsive Encephalopathy associated with Autoimmune Thyroiditis) is often misdiagnosed as dementia or psychiatric issues but is identified by high antibodies and its responsiveness to steroids."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "When 'Rebuilding the Broken Metabolism' (Lesson 8), why must the practitioner stabilize the HPA axis (Adrenals) before aggressively increasing T3 medication?",
            "options": [
                "T3 increases the metabolic clearance of cortisol, potentially triggering an adrenal crisis in depleted patients",
                "Adrenals produce TSH, so they must be healthy first",
                "T3 cannot be absorbed in the gut if cortisol is low",
                "There is no clinical reason; it is just a suggestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormone speeds up the metabolism of everything, including cortisol. If a client has very low adrenal reserve, adding T3 will 'burn through' their remaining cortisol, leading to a crash or 'thyroid storm' symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "What is the primary diagnostic tool used to screen for CIRS/Biotoxin illness in a clinical setting, as mentioned in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "The 24-hour urine iodine test",
                "The Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS) Test",
                "A standard CBC with differential",
                "A Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The VCS test measures neurological function and contrast sensitivity, which is typically impaired by the neurotoxins produced in CIRS (mold/Lyme)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In a complex 'Multi-System Collapse,' which of the following is considered a 'Root Cause' rather than a 'Downstream Symptom'?",
            "options": [
                "Low Free T3 levels",
                "High Reverse T3",
                "Latent Borrelia (Lyme) infection",
                "Brain fog and fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low T3, high RT3, and brain fog are all downstream effects. A latent infection like Borrelia is a primary driver (root cause) that triggers the inflammatory cascade leading to those symptoms."
