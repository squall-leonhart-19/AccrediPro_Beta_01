        {
            "id": "q25_1",
            "question": "According to Proctor’s Functional Model of Supervision discussed in Lesson 1, which function focuses specifically on the practitioner's emotional well-being and stress management?",
            "options": ["The Normative function", "The Formative function", "The Restorative function", "The Evaluative function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Restorative (or supportive) function focuses on the practitioner's emotional response to clinical work, helping to prevent burnout and maintain professional resilience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "During an Advanced Case Audit (Lesson 2), a supervisor notices a practitioner is only tracking TSH and fT4. Which 'Testing & Tracking' (T) metric is most critical to add to validate peripheral conversion efficiency?",
            "options": ["Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb)", "Reverse T3 (rT3) and the fT3/rT3 ratio", "Total T4", "Serum Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To validate 'T' (Testing & Tracking) specifically for conversion efficiency, monitoring rT3 alongside fT3 is essential to identify 'cellular hypothyroidism' that TSH alone might miss."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Hormone Harmony' (H), what is the supervisor’s primary role when a practitioner identifies a 'flat' 4-point cortisol curve in a Hashimoto’s patient?",
            "options": ["To recommend immediate high-dose DHEA supplementation", "To mentor the practitioner on the HPA-Thyroid-Gut axis connection", "To ignore the cortisol data as it is secondary to TSH", "To instruct the practitioner to refer the client to a psychiatrist"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervising 'H' involves ensuring the practitioner understands the systemic connections, specifically how HPA axis dysfunction (flat cortisol) impacts thyroid receptor sensitivity and conversion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 emphasizes the 'I & V' (Inflammation & Vitamin) phase. What is a specific 'Supervisory Red Flag' when reviewing a practitioner’s nutrient replenishment strategy?",
            "options": ["Recommending 200mcg of Selenium for TPOAb reduction", "Suggesting Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K2", "Introducing high-dose Iodine before addressing Selenium deficiency or inflammation", "Checking Ferritin levels before recommending Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Introducing iodine in an inflamed or selenium-deficient environment can exacerbate thyroid peroxidase damage; supervisors must ensure inflammation is managed first."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "When mentoring for 'Metabolic Empowerment' (E), Lesson 5 suggests that a 'Successful Metabolic Shift' is best evidenced by which data point?",
            "options": ["A 5lb weight loss in the first week", "An increase in Basal Body Temperature (BBT) toward 97.8-98.2°F", "A decrease in daily caloric intake to under 1,000 kcal", "The client's ability to perform high-intensity interval training (HIIT) daily"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BBT is a clinical proxy for metabolic rate and mitochondrial efficiency; mentoring practitioners to track this provides objective data on the 'E' phase success."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "Using the SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) feedback model from Lesson 6, which of the following is an example of 'Impact'?",
            "options": ["'In yesterday's case review...'", "'...you forgot to calculate the fT3/rT3 ratio...'", "'...which led to the client remaining symptomatic despite 'normal' labs.'", "'Next time, please use the calculator provided.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Impact' describes the result of the behavior; in this case, the clinical consequence of the practitioner's oversight."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "In Inter-professional Supervision (Lesson 7), what is the 'Hierarchy Paradox'?",
            "options": ["When a junior practitioner knows more about thyroid nutrition than the senior MD", "When the patient refuses to follow the supervisor's advice", "The conflict between medical authority and functional health evidence-based protocols", "The difficulty of maintaining clinical standards across different licensing boards"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hierarchy Paradox refers to the tension between traditional medical hierarchies and the collaborative, evidence-based functional approach required for complex thyroid cases."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Professional Legacy.' What is the primary difference between a 'Supervisor' and a 'Mentor' in this framework?",
            "options": ["Supervisors are paid; mentors are always volunteers", "Supervisors focus on clinical safety/competence; mentors focus on long-term career and character growth", "Mentors must be older than the person they are helping", "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While supervision is often focused on the immediate clinical case and safety (oversight), mentorship is a broader relationship focused on the mentee’s overall professional journey and legacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "A case audit reveals a client’s Ferritin dropped from 80 ng/mL to 22 ng/mL over 6 months, but the practitioner did not flag it because it was within 'normal' lab ranges. This is a failure in which supervisory area?",
            "options": ["Inter-professional Leadership", "The 'V' (Nutrient Replenishment) validation of optimal vs. normal ranges", "The Restorative function of supervision", "The SBI feedback loop"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervisors must ensure practitioners understand 'Optimal' ranges (e.g., Ferritin > 70-90 for thyroid function) rather than just 'Normal' lab ranges (which may go as low as 12)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "Research cited in the module indicates that practitioners receiving regular clinical supervision experience what percentage reduction in burnout rates compared to unsupervised peers?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Between 25% and 40%", "Over 75%", "There is no measurable difference"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies in clinical supervision (n=1,200+) show that structured support and the 'Restorative' function can reduce burnout and turnover by 25-40%."
