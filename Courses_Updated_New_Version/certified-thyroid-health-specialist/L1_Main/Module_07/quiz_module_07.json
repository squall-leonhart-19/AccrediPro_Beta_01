            "question": "When assessing advanced biomarkers, a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio (using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for rT3) is a key indicator of cellular thyroid sensitivity. What is the optimal clinical target for this ratio?",
            "options": [
                "Greater than 2.0",
                "Greater than 10.0",
                "Greater than 20.0",
                "Less than 5.0",
                "Greater than 0.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine, a Free T3/Reverse T3 ratio of >20 (when using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for rT3) indicates efficient conversion and cellular uptake, whereas a ratio below 20 suggests 'cellular hypothyroidism' regardless of TSH levels."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Art of Tracking' lesson, why might a client with a 'normal' TSH of 2.2 mIU/L still experience significant hypothyroid symptoms like cold intolerance and brain fog?",
            "options": [
                "TSH is an indirect measure of pituitary response, not a direct measure of peripheral tissue thyroid status.",
                "The client likely has too much Iodine in their system.",
                "TSH levels are only accurate when measured in the late afternoon.",
                "The pituitary gland is more sensitive to T3 than any other tissue in the body."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "TSH measures the pituitary's perception of circulating hormones, but it does not account for peripheral conversion (T4 to T3), receptor sensitivity, or the presence of Reverse T3 which can block T3 receptors."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Which specific halogen is known to competitively inhibit iodine uptake by the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS) and is frequently found in municipal water supplies and dental products?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium",
                "Fluoride",
                "Potassium",
                "Selenium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, Bromide, and Chlorine are halogens that compete with Iodine for uptake in the thyroid gland. Fluoride is particularly potent at displacing iodine, leading to reduced hormone synthesis."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "What percentage of T4 to T3 conversion is estimated to occur in a healthy gut via the action of the enzyme intestinal sulfatase?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5%",
                "Approximately 20%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 75%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Roughly 20% of T4 is converted into the active T3 (and T3S/T3AC) in the GI tract. Dysbiosis or 'Leaky Gut' can significantly impair this conversion, leading to low T3 symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In the context of Hashimoto's and molecular mimicry, which food protein has a molecular structure most similar to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin?",
            "options": [
                "Casein (Dairy)",
                "Alpha-Gliadin (Gluten)",
                "Zein (Corn)",
                "Ovalbumin (Egg)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gliadin, the protein found in gluten, shares a similar molecular structure with thyroid tissue. In a process called molecular mimicry, the immune system may attack the thyroid after being sensitized to gluten."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "When implementing the 'Selenium-Zinc-Iodine Triad,' why is it clinically dangerous to supplement high-dose Iodine without ensuring adequate Selenium levels first?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine will cause the body to excrete all Zinc.",
                "Selenium is required for the production of glutathione peroxidase, which protects the thyroid from the oxidative stress created during iodine processing.",
                "Iodine cannot be absorbed in the gut without Selenium.",
                "Selenium prevents the 'Wolff-Chaikoff' effect from occurring."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iodine processing in the thyroid creates hydrogen peroxide. Selenium-dependent enzymes (glutathione peroxidase) neutralize this peroxide. Without Selenium, high-dose iodine can cause oxidative damage and trigger an inflammatory 'flare' in Hashimoto's patients."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Which mitochondrial nutrient is often depleted in hyperthyroid states, leading to muscle wasting, but is also critical in hypothyroid states to assist in the transport of fatty acids for energy production?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "L-Carnitine",
                "Calcium",
                "Vitamin D3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Carnitine levels are inversely correlated with thyroid hormone levels. It is essential for mitochondrial beta-oxidation (fat burning) and can help modulate the effects of excess thyroid hormone on tissues."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Within the T.H.R.I.V.E. Protocol, what does the 'R' stand for, and what is its primary focus?",
            "options": [
                "Remove Triggers; focus on toxins and pathogens.",
                "Restore Nutrients; focus on repletion of Selenium, Zinc, and Iron.",
                "Replenish Microbiome; focus on probiotics and fiber.",
                "Re-evaluate Labs; focus on testing every 2 weeks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Protocol, 'R' stands for Restore Nutrients. This phase focuses on correcting the foundational deficiencies (like Selenium, Zinc, and Ferritin) required for thyroid hormone production and conversion."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course suggests that Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria can decrease the expression of which enzyme, directly lowering T3 levels?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Type 1 Deiodinase (D1)",
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "Pepsin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxins) from the gut trigger systemic inflammation which downregulates the D1 and D2 deiodinase enzymes, the primary catalysts for converting T4 into the active T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which heavy metal has the highest affinity for binding to the sulfur groups in deiodinase enzymes, effectively 'poisoning' the conversion of T4 to T3 even if all nutrients are present?",
            "options": [
                "Aluminum",
                "Mercury",
                "Lead",
                "Arsenic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mercury is a potent endocrine disruptor that binds to the selenium-dependent deiodinase enzymes. This prevents the enzymes from converting T4 to T3, leading to clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism despite 'normal' T4 levels."
