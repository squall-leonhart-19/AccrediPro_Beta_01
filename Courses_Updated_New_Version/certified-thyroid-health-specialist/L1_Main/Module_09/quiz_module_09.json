            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Method™ Framework, what does the 'R' represent, emphasizing the transition from symptom management to long-term resolution?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid Hormone Replacement",
                "Root Cause Resolution",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Root Cause Resolution is the core of the framework, focusing on identifying why the thyroid is struggling (e.g., gut health, toxins, or stress) rather than just medicating the symptoms."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "Which component of the HPT Axis acts as the 'thermostat,' sensing circulating levels of thyroid hormone and releasing TRH accordingly?",
            "options": [
                "Anterior Pituitary",
                "Thyroid Gland",
                "Hypothalamus",
                "Adrenal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hypothalamus monitors the blood and releases Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH) to signal the pituitary gland, acting as the primary sensor in the feedback loop."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A comprehensive thyroid panel is considered incomplete without 'Free' fractions. Why is measuring Free T3 (fT3) more clinically significant than Total T3?",
            "options": [
                "Total T3 is only found in the liver.",
                "Free T3 represents the unbound, biologically active hormone available to enter cells.",
                "Total T3 measures only the hormone produced by the thyroid gland directly.",
                "Free T3 levels do not fluctuate with stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Over 99% of thyroid hormones are bound to carrier proteins; only the 'Free' portion is active and capable of binding to nuclear receptors to affect metabolism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TPO antibodies indicate an autoimmune attack against the enzyme responsible for thyroid hormone synthesis, the hallmark of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Reverse T3 (rT3) is created when the body uregulates which specific enzyme, typically during periods of 'metabolic emergency' or chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "Deiodinase Type 1 (D1)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Deiodinase Type 3 (D3) converts T4 into Reverse T3 (an inactive isomer) and T3 into T2, effectively slowing down the metabolic rate."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "When comparing Functional vs. Pathological ranges, what is the 'Optimal' functional range for TSH recommended for most healthy adults?",

                "0.45 – 4.5 uIU/mL",

                "0.1 – 1.0 uIU/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While labs often allow TSH up to 4.5 or 5.0, functional medicine identifies the 1.0 – 2.0 uIU/mL range as the zone where most patients report the best energy and symptom resolution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A consistent waking temperature below 97.8°F is a classic subjective indicator that the thyroid/metabolic 'engine' is running cold."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "In the Lesson 8 Case Study, a client presents with 'Normal' TSH (2.1) and 'Normal' fT4, but exhibits classic hypothyroid symptoms. If their Reverse T3 is high, this pattern is known as:",

                "Hyperthyroidism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This pattern shows the thyroid is producing hormone (normal TSH/T4), but the body is 'shunting' that hormone into the inactive rT3 form, often due to systemic inflammation or stress."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Which of the following nutritional deficiencies is most likely to impair the conversion of T4 to T3, thereby increasing the production of Reverse T3?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a required cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes (D1 and D2) that convert T4 to active T3; without it, conversion is impaired."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "When calculating the fT3/rT3 ratio (using pg/mL for fT3 and ng/dL for rT3), a healthy functional ratio is generally considered to be above:",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A ratio above 20 (when using pg/mL for fT3 and ng/dL for rT3) suggests that the body is successfully prioritizing active T3 production over the 'emergency brake' rT3."
