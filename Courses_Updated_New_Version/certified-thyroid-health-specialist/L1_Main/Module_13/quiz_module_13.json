            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "When interpreting an advanced thyroid panel, a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio (pg/mL) below which threshold is clinically significant for indicating 'cellular hypothyroidism' or poor conversion?",
            "options": [
                "20",
                "50",
                "5",
                "100"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine, a Free T3/Reverse T3 ratio below 20 (when using pg/mL for FT3) often indicates that the body is shunting T4 into the inactive rT3 form rather than the active T3 form, usually due to stress or inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Chronic HPA axis activation and elevated cortisol levels impact the HPT axis primarily by inhibiting which enzyme responsible for peripheral thyroid conversion?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "5'-deiodinase",
                "Aromatase",
                "Protease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol suppresses the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into the active T3, while simultaneously increasing the conversion of T4 into Reverse T3."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Which group of environmental endocrine disruptors (EDCs) are known as 'Halogen Mimics' that compete with Iodine for uptake via the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)?",
            "options": [
                "Phthalates and Parabens",
                "Bisphenol A (BPA) and BPS",
                "Fluoride, Bromine, and Chlorine",
                "Organophosphates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, Bromine, and Chlorine are halogens that sit in the same column of the periodic table as Iodine. They can displace iodine in the thyroid gland, leading to impaired hormone synthesis."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "The 'Molecular Mimicry' theory regarding stealth infections like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) suggests that:",
            "options": [
                "The virus directly eats thyroid tissue for energy.",
                "Viral proteins share structural similarities with thyroid proteins, causing the immune system to cross-react.",
                "The virus prevents the absorption of all thyroid medications.",
                "Viruses only affect the thyroid if TSH is already high."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system develops antibodies against a pathogen (like EBV) that happen to recognize similar sequences on human tissue (like TPO or Thyroglobulin), leading to autoimmunity."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, which marker of systemic inflammation is highlighted as a 'Red Flag' because it can decrease thyroid hormone receptor sensitivity even if blood levels of T3 appear normal?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c",
                "hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)",

                "Serum Calcium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of hs-CRP indicate systemic inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can downregulate thyroid receptors, meaning cells cannot 'hear' the signal of T3 even if it is present in the blood."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Why is it critical to ensure adequate Selenium status before initiating high-dose Iodine supplementation in a Hashimoto's patient?",
            "options": [
                "Selenium is required to transport iodine into the cell.",
                "Iodine cannot be absorbed without selenium.",
                "Selenium-dependent enzymes (glutathione peroxidase) neutralize the hydrogen peroxide produced during iodine oxidation.",
                "Selenium prevents iodine from turning into T4."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The process of oxidizing iodine for hormone synthesis produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Without enough Selenium to fuel glutathione peroxidase, this H2O2 can damage thyroid tissue and trigger an autoimmune flare."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "T3 (Triiodothyronine) optimizes metabolic rate by entering the mitochondria and stimulating the expression of which proteins that generate heat instead of ATP?",

                "Insulin Receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "T3 increases the expression of Uncoupling Proteins (UCPs), particularly UCP1 and UCP3, which allow protons to leak across the mitochondrial membrane, generating thermogenesis (heat) and increasing basal metabolic rate."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "According to the T.H.R.I.V.E. Method™ Clinical Synthesis, what is the 'I' in the acronym representing in the context of thyroid recovery?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The T.H.R.I.V.E. Method™ stands for Testing, HPT-Axis support, Root Cause identification, Inflammation control, Vital nutrients, and Energy/Mitochondrial optimization."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Estrogen Dominance' (high estrogen relative to progesterone). How does this specifically impact thyroid bioavailability?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), leaving less 'Free' hormone available for cells.",
                "It destroys the thyroid gland directly.",
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to T3.",
                "It lowers TSH to undetectable levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Excess estrogen stimulates the liver to produce more Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). TBG acts like a 'sponge' that binds to thyroid hormones, reducing the amount of Free T4 and Free T3 available to enter the cells."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Which mitochondrial nutrient serves as a critical electron carrier in the Electron Transport Chain and is frequently depleted by statin medications, further complicating thyroid-related fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)",
                "Potassium",
                "Zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 is essential for mitochondrial ATP production. Since many thyroid patients are also prescribed statins for high cholesterol (common in hypothyroidism), CoQ10 depletion often exacerbates their fatigue."
