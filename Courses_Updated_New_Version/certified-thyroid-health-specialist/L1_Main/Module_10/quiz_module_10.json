            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "A client presents with persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite 'normal' serum TSH and T4 levels. Which SNP in the genomic landscape is most likely responsible for impaired intracellular T3 availability?",
            "options": [
                "MTHFR C677T",
                "DIO2 rs225014 (Thr92Ala)",
                "COMT V158M",
                "VDR Taq"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DIO2 SNP (specifically the CC genotype of rs225014) is associated with reduced efficiency in converting T4 to T3 within the brain and peripheral tissues, often requiring T3-containing medications for symptomatic relief."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "When interpreting advanced labs, a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio (using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for rT3) is considered suboptimal for cellular metabolism if it falls below which threshold?",
            "options": [
                "2.0",
                "10.0",
                "20.0",
                "50.0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Free T3/Reverse T3 ratio below 20 (or 0.02 if using the same units) suggests that the body is prioritizing the production of the inactive rT3 over active T3, typically due to stress, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In the Thyroid-Gut-Brain axis, how do Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from intestinal dysbiosis directly impact thyroid signaling?",
            "options": [
                "They stimulate the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS).",
                "They increase the expression of Deiodinase Type 1 (DIO1).",
                "They trigger TLR4 receptors, leading to the downregulation of TSH receptors and DIO1.",
                "They act as a precursor to Thyroglobulin synthesis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LPS are endotoxins that trigger the TLR4 pathway, inducing systemic inflammation which downregulates DIO1 (reducing T4-T3 conversion) and decreases TSH receptor sensitivity."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "According to the principle of Halogen Displacement, which elements can compete with Iodine for uptake in the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium and Magnesium",
                "Fluoride, Bromide, and Chloride",
                "Zinc and Copper",
                "Iron and Selenium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluoride (water/toothpaste) and Bromide (flame retardants/bread) are in the same halogen group as Iodine and can competitively inhibit iodine uptake in the thyroid gland, contributing to goiter and hypothyroidism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which pathogen is most frequently cited in literature for triggering Hashimoto's Thyroiditis via 'molecular mimicry' due to its homology with thyroglobulin?",
            "options": [
                "Candida albicans",
                "H. pylori",
                "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)",
                "Staphylococcus aureus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EBV is a primary suspect in molecular mimicry; the immune system produces antibodies against viral proteins that accidentally cross-react with thyroid tissue (thyroglobulin or TPO) due to structural similarities."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Selenium is a critical cofactor for Glutathione Peroxidase. Why is this specifically vital during the production of thyroid hormones?",
            "options": [
                "It transports T4 across the blood-brain barrier.",
                "It neutralizes the Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) produced during the oxidation of iodide.",
                "It stimulates the pituitary to release more TSH.",
                "It prevents the absorption of dietary goitrogens."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The oxidation of iodide by TPO requires H2O2. Without sufficient Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, this H2O2 can damage the thyroid follicles, leading to inflammation and autoimmunity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, mitochondrial dysfunction was linked to thyroid health. Which nutrient acts as the 'shuttle' for long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation, a process regulated by T3?",
            "options": [
                "L-Carnitine",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Manganese",
                "Biotin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L-Carnitine is essential for fatty acid transport into the mitochondria. T3 regulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), meaning low T3 levels directly impair the ability to burn fat for fuel."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "Under the T.H.R.I.V.E. Roadmap, if a client has high antibodies and chronic bloating, which letter of the acronym should be addressed first according to the clinical synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "T (Toxic Load)",
                "R (Root Cause - Gut/Infection)",
                "V (Vital Nutrients)",
                "H (Hormonal Balance)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' (Root Cause) focuses on the Gut-Thyroid connection. Addressing dysbiosis and intestinal permeability is foundational for lowering antibody counts and improving nutrient absorption."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A lab report shows high TSH, high Free T4, and high Free T3. The client does not have a pituitary tumor. What is the most likely clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism",
                "Subclinical Hyperthyroidism",
                "Thyroid Hormone Resistance (Refetoff Syndrome)",
                "Iodine Deficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Thyroid Hormone Resistance occurs when the receptors (often the TR-beta isoform) do not respond to thyroid hormones, leading the body to produce high levels of both TSH and thyroid hormones in a failed attempt to elicit a metabolic response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which micronutrient synergy is required for the 'Pulse' of the thyroid gland, specifically for the conversion of T4 to T3 and the prevention of rT3 dominance?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium and Vitamin D",
                "Zinc, Selenium, and Iron",
                "Sodium and Potassium",
                "Copper and Vitamin K2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zinc and Selenium are required for deiodinase enzyme activity, while Iron is essential for TPO activity. A deficiency in any of these three will stall the T4 to T3 conversion process."
