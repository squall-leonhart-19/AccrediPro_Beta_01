        {
            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "How do systemic inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, primarily interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism at the cellular level?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the expression of Sodium-Iodide Symporters (NIS)",
                "They downregulate Type 1 Deiodinase (D1) activity, impairing T4 to T3 conversion",
                "They stimulate the pituitary gland to overproduce TSH",
                "They accelerate the clearance of Reverse T3 (rT3) from the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammatory cytokines are potent inhibitors of the D1 enzyme, which is responsible for the peripheral conversion of T4 into the active T3. This leads to 'Low T3 Syndrome' even when the thyroid gland itself is producing adequate T4."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Molecular mimicry occurs in Hashimoto's because the immune system confuses the structure of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) with which dietary protein?",
            "options": [
                "Casein (Dairy)",
                "Zein (Corn)",
                "Gliadin (Gluten)",
                "Ovalbumin (Egg)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The amino acid sequence of gliadin (a component of gluten) closely resembles the molecular structure of the TPO enzyme. This cross-reactivity means the immune system may attack the thyroid gland after being primed by gluten consumption."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "What is the primary oxidative byproduct generated during the synthesis of thyroid hormones that can lead to 'The Fire Inside' if antioxidant defenses are low?",
            "options": [
                "Superoxide Dismutase",
                "Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)",
                "Nitric Oxide",
                "Hydroxyl Radicals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) is a necessary 'fuel' for the TPO enzyme to iodinate thyroglobulin. However, if not neutralized by glutathione peroxidase (which requires Selenium), it causes localized oxidative damage to thyroid follicles."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In the Thyroid-Gut-Immune Axis, which marker of intestinal permeability is most closely linked to the systemic release of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)?",
            "options": [
                "Calprotectin",
                "Secretory IgA",
                "Zonulin",
                "Pancreatic Elastase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the protein that modulates the 'tight junctions' of the intestinal lining. Elevated zonulin levels indicate increased permeability, allowing LPS (endotoxins) to enter the blood and trigger TLR4-mediated inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A client experiencing an acute flare of TPO antibodies (e.g., >500 IU/mL) should be particularly cautious with which of the following interventions?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose Iodine supplementation",
                "Magnesium Glycinate",
                "Vitamin D3 with K2",
                "Omega-3 Fatty Acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-dose iodine can 'fuel the fire' during an active autoimmune flare by increasing H2O2 production, which further damages thyroid tissue and can lead to a surge in autoantibody production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which mechanism explains why 'Blood Sugar Rollercoasters' (hypoglycemia followed by hyperglycemia) are destructive to thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the half-life of T4",
                "They trigger repeated cortisol spikes which suppress TSH and T3 conversion",
                "They inhibit the absorption of Selenium in the duodenum",
                "They cause the thyroid gland to shrink (atrophy)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid blood sugar fluctuations trigger the adrenal glands to release cortisol. Chronic cortisol elevation suppresses the HPT axis (lowering TSH) and increases the conversion of T4 into the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Environmental 'Halogens' can displace iodine in the thyroid gland due to their similar atomic structure. Which halogen is commonly found in flame retardants and some soft drinks?",
            "options": [
                "Fluoride",
                "Chlorine",
                "Bromide",
                "Astatine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bromide (found in brominated vegetable oils, pesticides, and flame retardants) competes with iodine for the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS), leading to iodine deficiency and thyroid dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "According to the Module 4 protocol design, what is the 'First Pillar' of controlling thyroid inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Adding high-dose antioxidants",
                "Starting Thyroid Replacement Therapy (TRT)",
                "Identification and removal of dietary/environmental triggers",
                "Intense cardiovascular exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional thyroid health, you must 'stop the fire' (remove triggers like gluten, toxins, or allergens) before you can 'rebuild the house' (nutritional support or hormone replacement)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that consistent Selenium supplementation (200mcg/day) resulted in what average reduction of TPO antibodies?",
            "options": [
                "5-10% reduction",
                "20-40% reduction",
                "70-80% reduction",
                "No significant reduction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies and meta-analyses show that 200mcg of Selenium (as Selenomethionine) typically reduces TPO antibodies by 20-40% over 3-6 months by supporting glutathione peroxidase activity."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which specific 'Endocrine Disruptor' found in plastic linings and thermal receipts is known to bind to thyroid hormone receptors, blocking the action of T3?",
            "options": [
                "Glyphosate",
                "Bisphenol A (BPA)",
                "Mercury",
                "Lead"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA is a potent endocrine disruptor that has been shown to act as a thyroid hormone antagonist, meaning it can block T3 from binding to its receptors, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism even with normal lab levels."
