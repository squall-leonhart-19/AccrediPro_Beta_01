            "question": "Why is the 'TSH-only' screening method frequently criticized in functional thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "TSH is produced by the thyroid gland and doesn't reflect pituitary health.",
                "The pituitary gland has different nutrient requirements and deiodinase enzymes than peripheral tissues, making it a poor proxy for whole-body thyroid status.",
                "TSH levels remain static regardless of stress, inflammation, or caloric restriction.",
                "TSH is only accurate in pediatric populations and loses validity after age 40."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pituitary uses D2 deiodinase, which is much more efficient at converting T4 to T3 than the D1 deiodinase found in peripheral tissues. Consequently, the pituitary may feel 'satisfied' with hormone levels while the rest of the body is in a state of cellular hypothyroidism."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In functional medicine, what is generally considered the 'optimal' range for TSH, as opposed to the broader lab reference range?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 1.0 mIU/L",
                "0.5 - 2.0 mIU/L",
                "2.5 - 4.5 mIU/L",
                "4.5 - 10.0 mIU/L",
                "0.5 - 2.0 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard labs may allow TSH up to 4.5 or 5.0 mIU/L, functional ranges typically target 0.5 to 2.0 mIU/L. Data suggests that TSH levels above 2.5 are associated with increased metabolic risk and cardiovascular markers."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "High levels of cortisol and systemic inflammation (IL-6, TNF-alpha) are known to have what effect on the HPT axis?",
            "options": [
                "They stimulate the hypothalamus to increase TRH production.",
                "They increase the sensitivity of the thyroid gland to TSH.",
                "They suppress TSH production and inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.",
                "They increase the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), raising Free T3."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stress and inflammation act as a 'brake' on the system, suppressing the HPT axis at the hypothalamic/pituitary level and shifting deiodinase activity toward the production of inactive Reverse T3 (rT3) instead of active T3."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which enzyme is primarily responsible for the peripheral conversion of T4 into the active T3 hormone in the liver and kidneys?",
            "options": [
                "5'-deiodinase (Type 1)",
                "5-deiodinase (Type 3)",
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "Aromatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Type 1 deiodinase (D1) is the primary enzyme in peripheral tissues (liver, kidney, muscle) responsible for stripping an iodine atom from the outer ring of T4 to create active T3."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a TSH of 1.8, Free T4 in the top quartile, but Free T3 below the functional range. What is the most likely clinical pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism",
                "Pituitary Failure",
                "Conversion Disorder (Low T3 Syndrome)",
                "Graves' Disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When TSH and Free T4 look 'normal' or 'optimal' but Free T3 is low, it indicates the thyroid is producing hormone and the pituitary is responding, but the body is failing to convert T4 into the active T3 form."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When calculating the Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio (using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for rT3), what result typically suggests cellular thyroid resistance or 'survival mode'?",
            "options": [
                "A ratio greater than 30",
                "A ratio between 20 and 25",
                "A ratio below 20",
                "The ratio is irrelevant if TSH is normal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A ratio below 20 (or below 10 if using different units) suggests that the body is prioritizing the production of Reverse T3, which blocks T3 receptors, often due to chronic stress, illness, or extreme dieting."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Is it possible for a client to have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis if their TPO (Thyroid Peroxidase) antibodies are within the normal range?",
            "options": [
                "No, TPO antibodies must be elevated for a Hashimoto's diagnosis.",
                "Yes, they may have elevated Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb) instead, or be in a 'seronegative' state.",
                "Yes, but only if TSH is above 10.0.",
                "No, Hashimoto's is only diagnosed via biopsy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Approximately 10-15% of Hashimoto's patients are seronegative for TPO antibodies but may show TgAb elevation or characteristic changes on a thyroid ultrasound."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "According to the protocol established by Dr. Broda Barnes, what basal body temperature (BBT) threshold is indicative of a hypometabolic/hypothyroid state?",
            "options": [
                "Consistently below 98.6°F (37.0°C)",
                "Consistently below 97.8°F (36.6°C)",
                "Consistently above 99.0°F (37.2°C)",
                "Temperature fluctuations of more than 2 degrees daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Barnes found that a waking axillary temperature consistently below 97.8°F was a highly reliable clinical indicator of hypothyroidism, often more accurate than the early TSH tests of his era."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which supplement is notorious for causing 'analytical interference' in thyroid labs, potentially showing a falsely low TSH and falsely high T4/T3?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Magnesium Glycinate",
                "Biotin (Vitamin B7)",
                "Zinc Picolinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biotin interferes with the streptavidin-biotin immunoassay used in most labs. High doses (often found in hair/skin/nail supplements) can mimic the lab pattern of Graves' disease even in euthyroid patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "What is the primary clinical significance of testing 'Free' hormones (FT4, FT3) rather than 'Total' hormones?",
            "options": [
                "Total hormones are only found in the liver.",
                "Free hormones represent the unbound, biologically active fraction available to enter cells and bind to receptors.",
                "Total hormones are much more expensive to test.",
                "Free hormones measure the amount of hormone stored in the thyroid gland."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Over 99% of thyroid hormones are bound to carrier proteins (like TBG) and are inactive. Measuring 'Free' levels tells us what is actually available for the tissues to use, which is critical because protein binding can be affected by estrogen, liver health, and medications."
