            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, we discussed thyroid anatomy. Which specific cell type is responsible for the secretion of calcitonin, and how does it differ from follicular cells?",
            "options": [
                "Follicular cells; they secrete calcitonin into the colloid",
                "Parafollicular (C) cells; they are neuroendocrine cells located between follicles",
                "Thyrotropes; they are located within the thyroid parenchyma",
                "Chief cells; they regulate calcium through T3 synthesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parafollicular cells, also known as C-cells, are neuroendocrine cells in the thyroid that secrete calcitonin to regulate calcium levels, whereas follicular cells produce T4 and T3."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "According to the HPT Axis blueprint (Lesson 2), which of the following acts as a primary 'brake' on TSH secretion at the pituitary level?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Both dopamine and somatostatin exert inhibitory effects on the pituitary gland, reducing the secretion of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "During Thyroid Hormone Synthesis (Lesson 3), the 'organification' of iodine refers to which specific biochemical step?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Organification is the process where oxidized iodine is attached to tyrosine residues on the thyroglobulin molecule, facilitated by the enzyme Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights that approximately 80% of T3 is produced via peripheral conversion. Which deiodinase enzyme is primarily responsible for 'inactivating' T4 by converting it into Reverse T3 (rT3)?",
            "options": [
                "Deiodinase Type 1 (D1)",
                "Deiodinase Type 2 (D2)",

                "Deiodinase Type 4 (D4)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "D3 is the primary inactivating enzyme; it converts T4 into rT3 and T3 into T2, effectively acting as a metabolic 'emergency brake' during stress or illness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, we explored cellular transport. What is the clinical significance of the MCT8 transporter, particularly in the context of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only transporter capable of moving TSH into the hypothalamus",
                "It is a specific transporter required for T3 to enter neurons; mutations cause Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome",
                "It facilitates the excretion of excess iodine from the cell to prevent toxicity",
                "It transports Reverse T3 out of the cell to be recycled by the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MCT8 is a critical and highly specific transporter for T3. Its importance is highlighted by Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, where MCT8 mutations lead to severe neurological impairment despite normal peripheral levels."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 (Energy & Metabolic Empowerment) discusses the 'E' in THRIVE. Which mitochondrial process is directly up-regulated by T3 to increase Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 increases BMR by promoting the expression of Uncoupling Proteins (like UCP1), which allows protons to leak across the mitochondrial membrane, generating heat instead of ATP (thermogenesis)."

        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "When analyzing a 'Full Panel' (Lesson 7), a T3/rT3 ratio is often calculated. Which of the following ratios (using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for rT3) generally indicates healthy peripheral conversion?",
            "options": [
                "A ratio below 2",
                "A ratio between 5 and 10",
                "A ratio of 20 or higher",
                "The ratio is irrelevant if TSH is within the lab reference range"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine, a T3/rT3 ratio (using Free T3 in pg/mL and Reverse T3 in ng/dL) of 20 or higher is typically targeted to ensure efficient conversion and cellular uptake."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with TSH 3.8 uIU/mL, FT4 1.2 ng/dL (mid-range), but FT3 2.1 pg/mL (low-end). Based on Lesson 4 and 8, what is the most likely physiological bottleneck?",

                "Iodine toxicity causing the Wolff-Chaikoff effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Normal TSH and mid-range FT4 paired with low FT3 strongly suggests a 'conversion bottleneck,' where the body is producing enough T4 but failing to convert it into the active T3."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Lesson 3 emphasizes the micronutrient connection. Which mineral is required specifically for the 'cleavage' of iodine from thyroglobulin and the antioxidant protection of the gland via glutathione peroxidase?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a constituent of selenoproteins like glutathione peroxidase, which protects the gland from H2O2 damage, and it is a vital cofactor for deiodinase enzymes."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Method™ Clinical Synthesis (Lesson 8), why is it critical to address 'Gut Health' (the 'H' in THRIVE) before aggressively increasing thyroid hormone dosage?",
            "options": [
                "Because 20% of T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the gut via the enzyme sulfatase",
                "Because thyroid hormone is strictly absorbed in the large intestine",
                "Because gut bacteria produce TSH-like peptides that confuse the pituitary",
                "Because the gut is the primary site of TSH synthesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Approximately 20% of T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the GI tract through the action of intestinal sulfatase, which converts T3-sulfate and T3AC back into active T3."
