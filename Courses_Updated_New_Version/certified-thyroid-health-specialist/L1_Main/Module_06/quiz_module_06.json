            "question": "Triiodothyronine (T3) exerts its most significant effect on cellular energy by upregulating which specific mitochondrial coactivator?",
            "options": [
                "PGC-1alpha",
                "AMPK",
                "mTOR",
                "GLUT4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "T3 stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis primarily through the activation of PGC-1alpha (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), which serves as the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Set Point' Theory and research on adaptive thermogenesis, an aggressive caloric deficit can lead to a reduction in Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) of up to what percentage beyond what is explained by weight loss alone?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-25%",
                "40-50%",
                "Less than 2%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies on metabolic adaptation show that the body can lower its RMR by 15-25% in response to perceived starvation, a mechanism designed to preserve energy stores when thyroid hormone levels (specifically T3) drop."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "To optimize the circadian-metabolic axis, what is the recommended timing for 'anchoring' the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) with high-intensity blue light (sunlight)?",
            "options": [
                "Within 30-60 minutes of waking",
                "Exactly at solar noon",
                "2 hours before sleep",
                "Only during the 'golden hour' at sunset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Early morning light exposure (within 30-60 minutes of waking) triggers the cortisol awakening response and suppresses melatonin, setting the metabolic clock for the next 24 hours."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client with hypothyroidism presents with high Reverse T3 (rT3) and low Free T3 despite being on T4-only medication. They perform 5 days of high-intensity HIIT per week. What is the likely physiological explanation?",
            "options": [
                "The HIIT is increasing deiodinase 1 (D1) activity",
                "Excessive cortisol from overtraining is inhibiting D1 and stimulating D3",
                "HIIT is increasing the 'Set Point' too quickly",
                "The client needs more T4 to compensate for the exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Overtraining creates a chronic stress response. Elevated cortisol inhibits the D1 enzyme (which converts T4 to T3) and stimulates the D3 enzyme, which converts T4 into the metabolically inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "How does chronic hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) directly impair thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the sensitivity of the TSH receptor",
                "It triggers a 'famine' signal that downregulates the conversion of T4 to T3 to conserve energy",
                "It causes the thyroid gland to overproduce T2",
                "It has no direct effect; only hyperglycemia impacts the thyroid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blood sugar instability, particularly hypoglycemia, is interpreted by the body as a survival threat. This downregulates T4 to T3 conversion to slow the metabolic rate and preserve glucose for the brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "In the context of 'Brain Fog' (Lesson 6), what is the primary mechanism by which low T3 levels contribute to cognitive decline?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of beta-amyloid plaques only",
                "Reduced cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired microglial 'cleanup' activity",
                "Excessive dopamine production",
                "Thinning of the skull bone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 is essential for cerebral glucose utilization. When T3 is low, the brain lacks the energy required for cognitive processing, and microglia (the brain's immune cells) become sluggish, leading to neuroinflammation and 'fog'."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Using the 'Broda Barnes' method of metabolic tracking, what waking basal body temperature range typically indicates a healthy, resilient metabolic rate?",
            "options": [
                "95.0°F - 96.0°F",
                "96.5°F - 97.2°F",

                "99.5°F - 100.1°F"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dr. Broda Barnes established that a waking temperature of 97.8°F to 98.2°F (36.5°C - 36.8°C) is the gold standard for thyroid-driven metabolic health."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Metabolic Flexibility is defined as the body's ability to:",
            "options": [
                "Switch efficiently between burning carbohydrates and burning fats based on availability",
                "Exercise for long periods without needing to eat",
                "Maintain a high TSH regardless of stress levels",
                "Lose weight while eating an unlimited amount of calories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is the capacity to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability. Thyroid hormones play a key role in this 'shuttling' process between glucose and lipid metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Red Flag' during temperature and pulse tracking that suggests a client is in a 'stress-driven' metabolic state rather than a 'thyroid-driven' one?",
            "options": [
                "A waking pulse of 75 bpm and a temperature of 98.0°F",
                "A high pulse (>85 bpm) paired with a low body temperature (<97.0°F)",
                "A temperature that rises slightly after breakfast",
                "A pulse that drops slightly during deep sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high pulse combined with a low temperature often indicates that the body is using adrenaline and cortisol to maintain 'false energy' because the thyroid-driven metabolism is insufficient."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "For a client with Hashimoto's in the 'Burnout' phase, which exercise prescription is most appropriate according to Module 6 guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Daily 45-minute HIIT sessions to 'jumpstart' the metabolism",
                "Zone 2 'MAFF' training and restorative movement (walking/yoga) to build a base without spiking cortisol",
                "Total sedentary rest for 4-6 weeks with no movement allowed",
                "Heavy powerlifting 6 days a week to increase testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the burnout phase, the goal is 'Movement without Burnout.' Zone 2 and restorative movement provide the benefits of circulation and insulin sensitivity without the massive cortisol spike associated with HIIT or heavy volume."
