            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which hormone, synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, serves as the primary 'master switch' to initiate the thyroid cascade?",
            "options": [
                "Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH)",
                "Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)",
                "Triiodothyronine (T3)",
                "Thyroxine-Binding Globulin (TBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "TRH is the hypothalamic hormone that triggers the pituitary to release TSH, starting the HPT axis cascade."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the context of HPA-HPT cross-talk, how does chronic cortisol elevation specifically contribute to 'cellular hypothyroidism'?",
            "options": [
                "By stimulating the production of more T4 in the thyroid gland",
                "By inhibiting the 5'-deiodinase enzyme and increasing Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "By increasing the sensitivity of thyroid hormone receptors",
                "By lowering the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG) in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol shifts peripheral metabolism from active T3 production to the inactive rT3 isomer by inhibiting the 5'-deiodinase enzyme (D1 and D2)."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client taking oral estrogen-based birth control presents with symptoms of hypothyroidism despite 'normal' Total T4 levels. What is the most likely mechanism at play?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen increases TPO antibodies",
                "Estrogen stimulates the hypothalamus to stop producing TRH",
                "Estrogen increases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), reducing the 'Free' fraction of hormones",
                "Estrogen directly blocks the TSH receptor on the thyroid gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oral estrogen increases the liver's production of TBG, which binds more thyroid hormone, leaving less 'Free' T4 and T3 available for cellular use."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Insulin Resistance, why is optimal insulin signaling required for thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin is required for the thyroid to uptake iodine",
                "Insulin resistance impairs the hepatic conversion of T4 to T3",
                "High insulin levels decrease the production of TSH",
                "Insulin is the primary carrier protein for T3 in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The liver is a major site for T4 to T3 conversion; insulin resistance disrupts this metabolic signaling, often leading to low T3 levels despite normal T4."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which mechanism best describes how Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) like BPA cause 'Receptor Blockade'?",
            "options": [
                "They physically destroy the thyroid gland tissue",
                "They act as competitive inhibitors, binding to thyroid receptors without activating them",
                "They increase the rate of T4 excretion in the urine",
                "They prevent the pituitary from sensing T3 levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many EDCs have a molecular structure similar enough to T3 that they can occupy the receptor site, preventing actual thyroid hormones from delivering their message."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In patients with PCOS and hyperandrogenism (high testosterone), what is the typical effect on Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG)?",
            "options": [
                "Testosterone increases TBG, leading to lower Free T3",
                "Testosterone has no effect on thyroid proteins",
                "Testosterone decreases TBG, which can lead to higher Free hormone fractions but faster clearance",
                "Testosterone converts into TSH in the peripheral tissues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Androgens generally decrease TBG levels (the opposite effect of estrogen), which can cause fluctuations in the availability and clearance of free thyroid hormones."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Leptin resistance, often seen in chronic overnutrition or obesity, leads to a 'Starvation Response' in the HPT axis. What is the primary result of this signal?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in TRH to boost metabolism",
                "A downregulation of TRH expression in the hypothalamus to conserve energy",
                "A sudden surge in T3 to burn off excess fat",
                "The destruction of the TSH receptors in the pituitary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the brain becomes resistant to leptin signals, it perceives a state of starvation and downregulates TRH to lower the basal metabolic rate."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Based on circadian biology research, when does the peak physiological surge of TSH typically occur in a healthy individual?",
            "options": [
                "At 8:00 AM immediately upon waking",
                "At 12:00 PM during peak metabolic activity",
                "In the late evening/early night, usually between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM",
                "TSH levels remain static throughout the 24-hour cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TSH follows a circadian rhythm, with a significant surge occurring in the late evening, which is why sleep deprivation can so easily disrupt thyroid function."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, 42, has been on a strict low-carb diet and doing daily 60-minute HIIT sessions. Her labs show high rT3 and low-normal Free T3. Which intervention should be prioritized based on Module 2 concepts?",
            "options": [
                "Increase her exercise intensity to 'break through' the plateau",
                "Address the HPA-axis stress response by increasing caloric/carb intake and reducing HIIT",
                "Prescribe a T4-only medication immediately",
                "Switch her to a carnivore diet to eliminate all potential EDCs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is likely experiencing a 'starvation response' where high cortisol and low energy availability are driving T4 into rT3. Restoring energy balance is the physiological priority."

            "question": "How does melatonin provide 'thyro-protection' according to Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a precursor to T4",
                "It stimulates the liver to produce more TBG",
                "It functions as a potent antioxidant, neutralizing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) within the thyroid gland",
                "It blocks the absorption of goitrogens in the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin is highly concentrated in the thyroid gland and protects the delicate follicular cells from oxidative stress generated during hormone synthesis."
