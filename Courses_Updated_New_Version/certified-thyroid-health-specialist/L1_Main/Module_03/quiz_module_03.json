            "question": "According to the Root Cause Framework, which of the following best describes the difference between a 'trigger' and a 'mediator'?",
            "options": [
                "A trigger is the genetic predisposition, while a mediator is the environmental toxin.",
                "A trigger initiates the immune response, while a mediator sustains the chronic inflammatory state.",
                "A trigger is always a food sensitivity, while a mediator is always a viral infection.",
                "Triggers and mediators are identical terms used interchangeably in clinical mapping."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triggers (like a stressful event or acute infection) set the process in motion, while mediators (like ongoing nutrient deficiencies or chronic dysbiosis) keep the dysfunction active."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which protein is the primary modulator of intestinal tight junctions, often elevated in patients with 'leaky gut' and Hashimoto's?",
            "options": [
                "Albumin",
                "Zonulin",
                "Calprotectin",
                "Occludin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; high levels indicate increased intestinal permeability, allowing triggers to enter the bloodstream."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Molecular mimicry occurs because the amino acid sequence of gliadin (gluten) closely resembles the protein structure of which thyroid-related component?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)",
                "Thyroglobulin and Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",

                "The Sodium-Iodide Symporter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The immune system confuses the protein structure of gliadin with thyroid tissue (TPO and TG) due to their structural similarity, leading to cross-reactivity."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the context of halogen displacement, which elements compete with iodine for uptake in the thyroid gland?",
            "options": [

                "Arsenic, Aluminum, and Nickel"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, Bromide, and Chlorine are in the same chemical column as Iodine; they can displace iodine in the thyroid, leading to reduced hormone production."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A landmark study found that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) was present in the thyroid glands of what percentage of Hashimoto's patients compared to 0% of healthy controls?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research has shown EBV present in 80% of thyroid samples from Hashimoto's patients, highlighting its role as a significant viral driver of autoimmunity."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Approximately 60% of the conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone occurs in which organ?",
            "options": [
                "The Kidneys",
                "The Gut",
                "The Liver",
                "The Skeletal Muscle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The liver is the primary site for peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, making liver health essential for maintaining active thyroid hormone levels."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "How does chronic HPA axis activation and elevated cortisol specifically impact thyroid hormone labs?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to T3.",
                "It lowers TSH while simultaneously increasing Reverse T3 (rT3).",
                "It increases the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG).",
                "It stimulates the thyroid to produce more T4."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme (which converts T4 to T3) and instead diverts T4 into the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3) form."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Which endotoxin, derived from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut, can suppress TSH and decrease the expression of thyroid hormone receptors?",
            "options": [
                "Aflatoxin",
                "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)",
                "Histamine",
                "Oxalates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS (Lipopolysaccharides) are potent inflammatory triggers that can cross into the blood via a leaky gut, directly interfering with thyroid signaling and conversion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When a client presents with both high estrogen and low T3, which Phase II detoxification pathway should be prioritized in the Root Cause Audit?",
            "options": [
                "Acetylation",
                "Methylation",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Sulfation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation is the pathway responsible for the conjugation and excretion of both estrogen and thyroid hormones; congestion here leads to hormone recycling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "In the clinical mapping process, why is 'Blood Sugar & HPA Axis' usually addressed before 'Heavy Metal Detoxification'?",
            "options": [
                "Because heavy metals are never a real root cause.",
                "To ensure the body has the metabolic stability and energy required to handle the stress of detoxification.",
                "Because blood sugar is easier to test than heavy metals.",
                "Because insulin directly converts T4 to T3."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Detoxification is energy-intensive and stressful. Stabilizing blood sugar and the stress response ensures the patient's drainage pathways and cellular energy can handle the toxin clearance."
