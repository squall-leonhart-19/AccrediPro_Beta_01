            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "In the context of the HPT Feedback Loop, which of the following non-thyroidal factors is most likely to suppress TSH secretion, potentially masking a primary hypothyroid state?",
            "options": [
                "Low circulating dopamine levels",
                "Chronic elevation of serum cortisol",
                "Acute estrogen dominance",
                "Decreased somatostatin activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of cortisol, often due to chronic stress or exogenous glucocorticoids, directly inhibit the release of TSH from the anterior pituitary and TRH from the hypothalamus, leading to 'falsely' normal TSH levels in symptomatic patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client's labs show a Free T3 of 2.8 pg/mL and a Free T4 of 1.4 ng/dL. Using the precision diagnostic approach from Lesson 2, what does the FT3/FT4 ratio (2.0 in this unit conversion) suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal peripheral conversion of T4 to T3",
                "Hyperthyroid tendencies requiring iodine restriction",
                "Poor T4 to T3 conversion efficiency",
                "Secondary hypothyroidism originating in the pituitary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy FT3/FT4 ratio (when using pg/mL and ng/dL) typically falls between 3.0 and 4.0. A ratio of 2.0 indicates that despite adequate T4, the body is not efficiently converting it into the active T3 form."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, which clinical scenario is most likely to trigger an 'rT3 Shunt,' where T4 is preferentially converted to Reverse T3 instead of Free T3?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive intake of cruciferous vegetables",
                "Systemic inflammation and high IL-6 levels",
                "Optimal selenium and zinc supplementation",
                "Low-stress environments with high caloric intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic inflammation (marked by cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha) upregulates the Deiodinase 3 (D3) enzyme, which converts T4 into Reverse T3 (an inactive 'brake'), while downregulating D1 and D2."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Cellular Thyroid Resistance.' What is the primary role of the MCT8 and MCT10 transporters in thyroid physiology?",
            "options": [
                "Binding T3 to the nuclear receptor (TR)",
                "Transporting iodine across the basement membrane of the thyrocyte",
                "Facilitating the entry of thyroid hormones across the cell membrane",
                "Synthesizing Thyroglobulin within the follicular lumen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MCT8 and MCT10 are specific transport proteins required to move thyroid hormones across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm; deficiencies or 'clogging' of these transporters can cause hypothyroid symptoms despite normal serum levels."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which halogen is identified in Lesson 5 as a significant endocrine disruptor due to its ability to competitively inhibit iodine uptake via the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Bromide",
                "Potassium",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bromide (found in some flours, pesticides, and flame retardants) is a halogen that competes with iodine for the NIS and thyroid receptors, effectively 'blocking' the thyroid's ability to utilize iodine."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "In the Gut-Thyroid Axis (Lesson 6), what is the primary mechanism by which 'Leaky Gut' (intestinal permeability) contributes to Hashimoto's Thyroiditis?",
            "options": [
                "Direct destruction of the thyroid gland by stomach acid",
                "Molecular mimicry where the immune system confuses food proteins/pathogens with thyroid tissue",
                "Increased absorption of iodine leading to toxicity",
                "Decreased production of bile salts necessary for T4 synthesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intestinal permeability allows undigested proteins and pathogens into the bloodstream, triggering an immune response. If these triggers share structural similarities with thyroid proteins (molecular mimicry), the immune system may begin attacking the thyroid."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 highlights micronutrient synergy. Which mineral is essential for the function of Glutathione Peroxidase, the enzyme that protects the thyroid gland from oxidative damage during T4 synthesis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a critical component of selenoproteins, including Glutathione Peroxidase (which neutralizes H2O2 during thyroid hormone production) and the Deiodinase enzymes."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In the THRIVE Method™ (Lesson 8), what does the 'R' stand for in the initial assessment phase?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE Method™ emphasizes 'Root Cause Identification' as a foundational step to move beyond symptomatic management and address the underlying drivers of thyroid dysfunction."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client presents with elevated TPO antibodies (250 IU/mL) but a 'normal' TSH of 2.4 mIU/L. Based on Lesson 6 and 8, what is the most appropriate clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The client has no thyroid issues because TSH is within the lab range",
                "The client has subclinical hyperthyroidism",
                "The client is in the 'euthyroid' stage of Hashimoto's and requires root-cause intervention",
                "The client needs immediate high-dose T4 replacement therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated antibodies indicate an active autoimmune process (Hashimoto's) even if the gland is still producing enough hormone to keep TSH in range. This is the ideal time for functional intervention to prevent further tissue destruction."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which deiodinase enzyme is primarily responsible for the intracellular conversion of T4 to active T3 within the brain and pituitary gland?",
            "options": [
                "Deiodinase 1 (D1)",
                "Deiodinase 2 (D2)",
                "Deiodinase 3 (D3)",
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deiodinase 2 (D2) is the primary enzyme for local T3 production in the brain and pituitary. D1 is more involved in providing systemic (serum) T3 from the liver and kidneys."
