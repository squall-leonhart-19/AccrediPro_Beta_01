            "options": [
                "By narrowing your focus to a specific sub-niche (e.g., Hashimoto’s Post-Partum), you actually increase your perceived value and market demand.",
                "By seeing as many different types of metabolic patients as possible, you reduce the risk of business failure.",
                "Specialization requires a lower price point to attract a high volume of clients.",
                "Specialists should avoid niche marketing to ensure they don't exclude potential T3-only patients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Specialist’s Paradox states that the narrower your niche, the more 'magnetic' your authority becomes to that specific group, allowing for higher premium pricing and better clinical outcomes."

            "options": [
                "To provide a full clinical diagnosis of the client's thyroid condition.",
                "To review every line item of the client's past 5 years of lab work.",
                "To determine 'Problem-Solution Fit' and assess the client’s readiness for the 90-day commitment.",
                "To sell the client on a high-ticket supplement package before the first session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Discovery Call is a qualifying tool used to ensure the client is a match for your specific methodology and possesses the motivation required for a transformation."

            "question": "When designing a Clinical Workflow (Lesson 3), which sequence is recommended for functional testing to ensure cost-effectiveness and clinical clarity?",
            "options": [
                "Advanced heavy metal testing first, followed by basic TSH.",
                "Foundational Blood Chemistry (Full Thyroid Panel) first, then 'Tier 2' testing (GI Map/DUTCH) based on remaining symptoms.",
                "Ordering all available tests simultaneously to get a 'full picture' immediately.",
                "Avoiding all lab work and relying solely on the client’s subjective symptom journal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A tiered approach prevents 'testing fatigue' and financial strain on the client, using foundational labs to identify the 80% of issues before moving to specialized functional tests."

            "id": "q30_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 advocates for a '90-Day Thyroid Transformation' package. What is the primary reason for choosing a 90-day duration over month-to-month coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It takes exactly 90 days for T4 to convert to T3 in all human tissues.",
                "It aligns with the physiological timeline of red blood cell turnover and the time needed to see significant antibody modulation.",
                "It is the maximum length allowed by professional liability insurance.",
                "Month-to-month coaching is illegal in most functional medicine jurisdictions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "90 days is a 'biological window' that allows for cellular turnover and sufficient time to track meaningful changes in markers like HbA1c and thyroid antibodies."

            "question": "Under Authority Marketing (Lesson 5), what is 'The Education Gap' and how should a specialist use it?",
            "options": [
                "The distance between a client's current knowledge and the PhD level required to understand thyroid health.",
                "The space between what a standard GP provides (TSH only) and what the client needs (Optimal ranges), which the specialist fills with content.",
                "A marketing tactic where you hide information from the client until they pay.",
                "The financial gap between public education and private coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By educating the client on the 'Optimal vs. Normal' lab range debate, you position yourself as the authority who understands the nuance that their previous providers missed."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Maintenance programs ensure long-term retention and prevent the regression of symptoms by providing lower-intensity, ongoing 'metabolic surveillance'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compliance requires using 'educational' and 'supportive' language rather than 'diagnostic' or 'prescriptive' language, which is reserved for licensed medical professionals."

            "question": "A potential client during an intake call says, 'My doctor says my labs are normal, but I'm losing my hair and I'm exhausted.' According to Lesson 2, what is the best 'Authority' response?",
            "options": [
                "'Your doctor is wrong; you definitely have hypothyroidism.'",
                "'Standard labs often look at a wide 'population average' rather than clinical 'optimal' ranges. We look at the narrow window where you actually feel good.'",
                "'You should stop taking your medication and try my supplement protocol instead.'",
                "'Hair loss is normal for your age, but we can try to help the fatigue.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This response validates the client's experience while introducing the 'Functional/Optimal' framework without making an illegal medical diagnosis."
