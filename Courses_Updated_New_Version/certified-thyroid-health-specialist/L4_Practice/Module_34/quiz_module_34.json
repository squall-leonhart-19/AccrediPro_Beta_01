            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While cost is a factor, the unique psychological benefit of the group model for thyroid patients is the 'normalization' of their experience, which reduces the isolation often felt with 'invisible' chronic illnesses."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Facilitating thyroid patients requires awareness of cognitive load; a 'State Change' helps reset the nervous system and manage the brain fog common in this demographic."
