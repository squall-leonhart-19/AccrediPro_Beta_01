            "question": "When transitioning from 1-on-1 to group thyroid coaching (L1), what is the primary mechanism that allows for improved client outcomes through 'social proof'?",
            "options": [
                "The coach spends more time with each individual",
                "Clients see peers overcoming similar symptoms (e.g., fatigue or weight stalls), which increases self-efficacy",
                "The cost of the program is significantly higher",
                "Group programs require less curriculum development"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group coaching leverages community dynamics where seeing peers succeed increases a client's belief in their own ability to heal (self-efficacy), often leading to better compliance and outcomes."

            "id": "q35_2",
            "question": "In a Hybrid Coaching Model (L2), what is the primary purpose of 'Digital Assets' like pre-recorded modules on the 'Thyroid-Gut Axis'?",
            "options": [
                "To replace the need for any live interaction",
                "To serve as a lead magnet for free traffic only",
                "To deliver foundational education asynchronously, preserving live sessions for high-level clinical strategy",
                "To increase the file size of the program so it looks more valuable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digital assets handle the 'repetitive' educational components, allowing the practitioner to focus live time on the client's specific lab nuances and personalized adjustments."

        {
            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Building Your Team' lesson (L3), which role is typically the first hire recommended for a practitioner reaching 80% capacity?",

                "A full-time Marketing Director",
                "A Registered Nurse for blood draws"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To scale, the practitioner must first offload non-clinical administrative tasks (scheduling, billing, email management) to free up 'Zone of Genius' time for clinical work."

                "Automated birthday greetings",
                "Automated supplement refill reminders based on purchase date",
                "Automated social media posting",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid patients often struggle with consistency; automated reminders for supplement refills ensure they don't run out of critical nutrients like selenium or zinc, maintaining the protocol's momentum."

            "id": "q35_5",
            "question": "When scaling 'Testing & Tracking' (L5) to 50+ active clients, why is a centralized EHR (Electronic Health Record) with lab integration essential?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the practice look more professional to investors",
                "It allows for automated data visualization of thyroid markers (TSH/T3/T4) over time across the whole cohort",
                "It is required by law for all health coaches",
                "It prevents the coach from having to talk to the client about labs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At volume, manual tracking becomes impossible. Integrated EHRs allow practitioners to quickly see trends and patterns across their client base, improving both individual and group-level care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic partnerships should be with providers who share a similar root-cause philosophy. A biological dentist is a key ally as oral health and toxicity directly impact thyroid function."

                "What the coach's competitors are charging"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket pricing reflects the massive value of the outcome (resolving chronic thyroid dysfunction) rather than the 'time' spent delivering it."

            "id": "q35_8",
            "question": "A practice has a Lifetime Value (LTV) of $4,000 and a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $500. What is the LTV:CAC ratio, and what does it indicate (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "1:8; the practice is losing money",
                "8:1; the practice has strong unit economics and high scalability vitality",
                "4:1; the practice is at the break-even point",
                "0.5:1; the practice should stop all marketing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An 8:1 ratio (LTV is 8x the cost to acquire) indicates a highly profitable and healthy business model capable of reinvesting in growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Churn rate measures retention. High churn in a thyroid practice often indicates a gap in client support or unrealistic expectations regarding the time needed for hormonal balance."

            "options": [
                "Ask every client all 200 possible questions",
                "Automatically trigger specific sub-questionnaires (e.g., SIBO screening) only if the client checks 'bloating'",
                "Prevent the client from finishing the form too quickly",
