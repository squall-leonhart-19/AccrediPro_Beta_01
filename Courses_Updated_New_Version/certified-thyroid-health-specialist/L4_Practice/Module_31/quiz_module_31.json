            "question": "In Lesson 1, why is defining a specific 'Thyroid Niche' (e.g., Post-Ablation Graves' Support) considered superior to being a general 'Thyroid Coach'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows you to charge lower prices to attract more people.",
                "It reduces your competition and increases your perceived authority as a specialist.",
                "It makes it easier to use generic marketing templates.",
                "It ensures that you never have to learn about other thyroid conditions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialization creates a 'Category of One' effect, where clients see you as the specific solution to their unique problem, allowing for higher authority and premium pricing."

        {
            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Method™ Framework for messaging, what does the 'I' represent?",
            "options": [
                "Implementation of supplements",
                "Intensity of symptoms",
                "Insight into the root cause",
                "Investment required for the program"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'I' stands for Insight, which involves educating the prospect on why their previous efforts failed and introducing the 'new way' (the root cause approach)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the primary disadvantage of 'Hourly Billing' in a thyroid coaching practice?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the coach work too many hours.",
                "It confuses the client regarding the schedule.",
                "It penalizes the coach for being efficient and focuses the client on cost rather than outcomes.",
                "It is illegal in most functional medicine jurisdictions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing creates a 'time-for-money' trap. High-ticket thyroid coaching should be outcome-based, focusing on the value of the transformation rather than the minutes spent on a call."

        {
            "id": "q31_4",

                "A 50-page ebook on the history of endocrinology",
                "A generic 'Healthy Eating' grocery list",
                "A 'Thyroid Lab Interpretation Checklist' or 'Symptom-to-Root Cause' Quiz",
                "A monthly newsletter with no specific topic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-intent lead magnets that provide immediate clarity on a client's specific thyroid status, such as lab checklists, consistently outperform general health information."

        {
            "id": "q31_5",
            "question": "When implementing the 'Authority Bridge' strategy in social media (Lesson 5), what is the goal of 'Polarizing Content'?",
            "options": [
                "To start arguments with other health coaches.",
                "To alienate everyone except your ideal client by taking a firm stand on a thyroid myth.",
                "To get as many likes as possible from the general public.",
                "To avoid talking about controversial topics like T3-only medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polarizing content helps you stand out by challenging the status quo (e.g., 'Why 'Normal' Lab Ranges are Failing You'), which attracts your ideal client while repelling those who aren't a fit."

        {
            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, which professional is identified as a 'Tier 1' strategic referral partner for a Thyroid Health Specialist?",

                "A high-volume weight loss surgeon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological dentists (who understand fluoride/mercury impacts) and functional pharmacists are Tier 1 partners because they see thyroid patients who are already seeking root-cause solutions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Gap Analysis helps the client realize that their current trajectory will not lead to their goals, creating the necessary 'tension' for them to commit to a solution."

            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the 'Rule of 10' for scaling from 1:1 to a group thyroid program?",
            "options": [
                "You must have 10 different thyroid certifications.",
                "You should have successfully guided at least 10 clients through your 1:1 process with consistent results.",
                "A group program must cost exactly 10% of your 1:1 price.",
                "The program must last exactly 10 weeks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rule of 10 ensures 'Proof of Concept.' You should not scale a program that hasn't been proven to work consistently in a 1:1 environment first."

                "Offer a 50% discount immediately to secure the sale.",
                "Tell them they don't care enough about their health.",

                "Hang up and move to the next lead."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical sales involves reframing the 'cost' of the program against the 'cost of inaction' (lost wages, poor quality of life, worsening health), helping the client prioritize their recovery."

        {
            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key element of a 'High-Ticket Thyroid Offer' structure discussed in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "Unlimited 24/7 access to the coach's personal cell phone.",
                "A list of 500 different supplements the client must buy.",
