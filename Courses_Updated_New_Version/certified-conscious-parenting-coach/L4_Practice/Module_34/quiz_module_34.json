                "4-6 participants",
                "8-12 participants",
                "20-25 participants",
                "Unlimited, provided there are breakout rooms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For high-impact, premium cohorts where deep processing is required, 8-12 participants is the 'sweet spot' that allows for diverse perspectives while maintaining a high level of individual attention and psychological safety."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Kinship Field' is defined as the collective energetic and emotional space of the group. What is the primary role of the coach in managing this field?",
            "options": [
                "To act as the sole source of wisdom and authority",
                "To prevent all conflict or discomfort from arising",
                "To serve as the 'Lead Regulator' for the group's collective nervous system",
                "To ensure every participant speaks for an equal amount of time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach acts as the Lead Regulator, using their own regulated nervous system to anchor the group's energy, especially during moments of high emotional intensity or shared vulnerability."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "Which facilitation technique involves a coach identifying a common thread in one parent's struggle and reflecting it back to the group to reduce shame?",

                "Interrogating",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Universalizing is a mastery-level facilitation skill where the coach highlights the 'human-ness' of a struggle, helping participants realize they are not alone and dissolving the isolation often felt in parenting."

            "options": [
                "Always perform the exercise with the most resistant member first",
                "Ensure participants have a 'somatic anchor' or grounding resource before beginning",
                "Complete the exercise as quickly as possible to avoid emotional overwhelm",
                "Only use exercises that have been approved by a licensed therapist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Experiential work can be evocative; establishing a somatic anchor (a physical resource for grounding) ensures participants can safely navigate deep emotions without becoming dysregulated."

            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "A participant in your group program consistently 'monopolizes' the time by sharing long, detailed stories. According to Lesson 5, what is the most conscious way to intervene?",
            "options": [
                "Mute them immediately and move to the next person",
                "Wait until they finish, even if it takes 20 minutes, to avoid hurting feelings",
                "Interrupt with empathy, validate the 'heart' of their share, and bridge to the group theme",
                "Tell the group that this person is taking up too much space and ask them to stop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Conscious facilitation requires 'interrupting with love'—validating the essence of the share while redirecting the energy back to the group's collective learning objective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain high impact in digital models, coaches should switch modalities (e.g., from lecture to chat, poll, or breakout) every 12-15 minutes to prevent 'Zoom fatigue' and passive disengagement."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Premium clients invest in outcomes (transformation) and the 'room' (the quality of the cohort), not the volume of information or minor discounts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In NPS methodology, scores of 9 and 10 are 'Promoters'—those most likely to refer others and report the highest level of satisfaction and impact."

                "The group is becoming unsafe and should be disbanded",
                "A necessary move toward deeper authenticity and 'true' community",
                "Participants are not ready for conscious parenting work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Storming phase is a sign of progress; it indicates that participants feel safe enough to show their real selves, including their triggers and disagreements, moving past 'polite' interaction into deep work."

            "options": [
                "The self-paced content is lower quality",
                "The lack of 'social presence' and accountability in the self-paced model",
                "Self-paced students are generally less committed to parenting",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social presence—the feeling of being 'in it' with others—is a primary driver of completion and transformation in parenting education, which is why cohorts typically outperform self-paced courses."
