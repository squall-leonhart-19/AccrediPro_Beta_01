            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Limitation of Liability clause is critical for risk management, as it restricts a coach's financial exposure by capping potential damages to a specific amount, often the cost of the coaching package itself."

            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses Value-Based Pricing. If a coach shifts from an hourly rate of $150 to a 12-week 'Conscious Connection' package priced at $2,500, what is the primary psychological driver for the client?",

                "The client perceives they are getting a discount on the hourly rate",
                "The client is investing in a specific outcome and transformation rather than 'buying time'",
                "The client prefers the convenience of a single payment over multiple invoices",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice involves transparency. Discussing the situation beforehand allows the coach and client to co-create boundaries that protect the therapeutic/coaching container while acknowledging the reality of the shared space."
