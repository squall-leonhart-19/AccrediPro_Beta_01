            "question": "Which specific neural mechanism is responsible for the 'automatic' mirroring of another person's motor actions and emotional states, forming the biological basis of empathy?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "Mirror Neuron Systems (MNS)",

                "The Corpus Callosum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons, primarily located in the premotor cortex and the inferior parietal lobe, fire both when an individual performs an action and when they observe that same action performed by another, allowing for an internal representation of the other's experience."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, validation is distinguished from agreement. Which of the following best describes the 'Conscious Parenting' approach to validation?",
            "options": [
                "Agreeing with the child's perspective to avoid conflict.",
                "Telling the child they are right even if their behavior is wrong.",
                "Acknowledging the reality of the child's internal emotional experience without necessarily endorsing their behavior.",
                "Explaining to the child why their feelings are logical and correct."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validation is the recognition and acceptance of another person's thoughts, feelings, and sensations as understandable, even if you do not agree with their logic or behavior."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Empathy-Boundary Paradox' suggests that many parents struggle to balance connection with limits. What is the 'Golden Rule' for resolving this paradox?",
            "options": [
                "Empathy first, boundaries second.",
                "Boundaries first, empathy if there is time.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The paradox is resolved by maintaining a high level of emotional warmth and empathy (soft on the person) while consistently upholding the structural boundary (firm on the limit)."

                "Manipulation and power-seeking.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Iceberg Model, behavior is the visible symptom, while the underlying drivers are almost always primary emotions or unmet needs such as safety, connection, or autonomy."

            "explanation": "Albert Mehrabian's research suggests that in the communication of feelings, only 7% is verbal (words), 38% is vocal (tone), and 55% is facial/body language."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The three components are Self-Kindness, Common Humanity, and Mindfulness. Self-esteem is a different construct based on evaluation, whereas self-compassion is based on acceptance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Silver Liner' block uses 'at least' statements to minimize the current pain by comparing it to a worse scenario, which often makes the child feel unheard."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, we learn that 'Empathy is caught, not taught.' What is the most effective way to mentor empathy in a child who has just hurt a sibling?",

                "Forcing the child to say 'I'm sorry' immediately.",
                "Lecturing the child on why hurting people is wrong.",

                "Putting the child in time-out so they can think about what they did."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Forced apologies do not build empathy. Modeling the repair process and helping the child reach a state of regulation allows their 'empathy circuitry' to engage so they can feel genuine remorse."

            "question": "A client's child is having a meltdown over a 'minor' issue. The parent is triggered and feels their 'Window of Tolerance' closing. What is the first step of Self-Empathy the coach should recommend?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Labeling the internal state ('Name it to Tame it') activates the prefrontal cortex and helps the parent move from a reactive state back into their window of tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Research into 'Affective Empathy' shows that when we see someone in pain, the ___________ is activated, which is the same area that processes our own physical and emotional pain.",
