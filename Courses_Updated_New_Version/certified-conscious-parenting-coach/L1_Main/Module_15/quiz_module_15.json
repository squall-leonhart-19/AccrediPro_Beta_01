            "question": "According to the lesson on the Neurobiology of Kinship (L1), what is the primary function of the Ventral Vagal complex during advanced co-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "To initiate the 'social engagement system' and foster a sense of felt safety",

                "To suppress the child's emotional expression to maintain household order",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal complex is the 'brake' on the stress response, facilitating the social engagement system which allows for connection and co-regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Conscious communication in high-stakes moments requires the parent to be regulated first; without reaching the 'Pause,' they cannot offer nurturing or effective communication."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Empathic distress leads to burnout because the parent 'takes on' the pain; compassion involves witnessing the pain while remaining regulated and care-oriented."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
