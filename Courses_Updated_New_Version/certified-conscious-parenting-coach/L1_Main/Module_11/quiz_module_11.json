            "question": "According to the Neurobiology of Relational Safety (L1), which state of the Autonomic Nervous System must be active for a child to access their 'Social Engagement System'?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Mobilization",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' branch of the nervous system. It is only in this state that the Social Engagement System is online, allowing for connection, learning, and empathy."

            "question": "In the context of Ego-Driven Control (L2), what is the primary psychological driver behind a parent's need to 'fix' their child's behavior immediately?",

                "A genuine desire for the child's long-term success",

                "A sophisticated understanding of restorative justice",
                "The child's biological need for strict boundaries"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ego-driven control is usually a defense mechanism against the parent's own feelings of inadequacy, fear, or the 'projected' judgment of others, rather than a response to the child's actual needs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In adolescence, the reward system (dopamine) is highly sensitive while the prefrontal cortex (executive function) is still under construction, leading to increased risk-taking and sensitivity to peer social rewards."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Restorative nurturing views behavior as communication. It seeks to identify the underlying unmet need or the lack of self-regulation skills rather than focusing on the 'wrongness' of the behavior."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load (the wear and tear on the body from chronic stress) is significantly mitigated by social support and the physiological experience of co-regulation within safe relationships."
