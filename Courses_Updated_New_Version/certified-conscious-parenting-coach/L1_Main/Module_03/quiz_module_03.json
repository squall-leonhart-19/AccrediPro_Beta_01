            "question": "In the 'Anatomy of Alignment' (Lesson 1), what is defined as the fundamental shift required to move from traditional to conscious parenting?",
            "options": [
                "Shifting from a focus on behavioral control to a focus on relational connection",
                "Shifting from child-led environments to parent-led structures",
                "Shifting from emotional validation to strict boundary setting",
                "Shifting from immediate consequences to delayed rewards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Alignment requires prioritizing the relationship (connection) over the outcome (control), as connection is the prerequisite for true influence."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, which of the following is a hallmark sign that a parent is operating from 'Ego' rather than 'Essence'?",
            "options": [
                "Feeling a sense of curiosity about the child's behavior",
                "Setting a boundary based on the family's core values",
                "Feeling that the child's behavior is a personal reflection or 'indictment' of the parent's worth",
                "Pausing to regulate their own nervous system before responding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ego seeks validation and views the child as an extension of the self; therefore, the child's 'failure' is perceived as the parent's failure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Developmental Alignment.' If a parent expects a 4-year-old to consistently inhibit impulses during high stress, they are likely ignoring which neurobiological reality?",
            "options": [
                "The child has a fully developed Prefrontal Cortex but chooses not to use it",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex, responsible for impulse control, is significantly underdeveloped at this age",
                "The Amygdala is not functional until age seven",
                "Children do not develop empathy until they reach double digits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developmental alignment requires matching expectations to the child's brain maturity; the Prefrontal Cortex is not fully developed until the mid-20s."

            "question": "In the context of 'The Power of the Pause' (Lesson 4), what is the primary purpose of somatic tools like 'Box Breathing' or 'Grounding'?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the child from their tantrum",
                "To signal to the child that the parent is ignoring them",
                "To move the parent's nervous system from a sympathetic (fight/flight) state to a ventral vagal (safe/social) state",
                "To demonstrate to the child how they should be acting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic tools are designed to regulate the parent's nervous system, allowing them to respond from a place of calm rather than react from a place of threat."

            "id": "q3_5",

            "options": [
                "Rules are for the parent; Values are for the child",
                "Values are internal qualities that guide the parent's behavior; Rules are external mandates for the child's behavior",
                "Values are only used during times of crisis",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in Conscious Parenting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Values provide a consistent internal compass for the parent's conduct, whereas rules are often reactive and focused on the child's compliance."

                "The age range where children are most receptive to coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal zone of arousal where we can remain integrated and present even in the face of stress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nurturing the blueprint means accepting the child for who they are (their essence) rather than trying to fix or change their fundamental nature."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client complains that their 10-year-old is 'disrespectful' because they argue back. Using the 'Ego vs. Essence' lens, what is the most likely 'Unconscious Agenda' at play?",
            "options": [
                "The parent has a need for absolute compliance to feel competent and respected",
                "The child is intentionally trying to ruin the parent's day",
                "The parent is too permissive and needs more 'Power-Over' tools",
                "The child lacks the cognitive ability to understand respect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When a parent feels 'disrespected' by a child's differing opinion, it often stems from an ego-driven need for control to validate their own authority."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collaborative models foster intrinsic motivation and self-regulation because the child learns the 'why' behind behaviors rather than just fearing punishment."
