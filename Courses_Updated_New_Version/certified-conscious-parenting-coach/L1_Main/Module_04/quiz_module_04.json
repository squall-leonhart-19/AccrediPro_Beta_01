            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to the Polyvagal Theory discussed in Lesson 1, which branch of the nervous system is activated when a child experiences 'Kinship' and social connection?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System (Fight/Flight)",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (Freeze/Shutdown)",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (Social Engagement System)",
                "The Amygdala-Driven Reactionary Loop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is the 'Social Engagement System' that allows for feelings of safety, connection, and kinship. It is the physiological foundation of a secure bond."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the parent is described as the child's 'External Nervous System.' What is the primary mechanism through which this co-regulation occurs?",
            "options": [
                "Strict verbal instructions and logical reasoning",
                "Mirror neurons and the parent's own regulated state",
                "Rewarding positive behaviors and ignoring negative ones",
                "The child's innate ability to self-soothe from birth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation occurs primarily through mirror neurons, where the child's nervous system 'tunes into' and mimics the physiological state of the parent's regulated nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Attachment Science (Lesson 3) defines the 'Secure Base' and 'Safe Haven.' Which of the following best describes the 'Safe Haven' function?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the child to explore the world independently",
                "Setting firm boundaries to prevent physical injury",
                "Providing a place for the child to return for comfort when they feel threatened or overwhelmed",
                "The physical structure of the family home"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the 'Secure Base' supports exploration, the 'Safe Haven' is the relational space the child returns to for comfort, soothing, and protection when they are distressed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Research by Ed Tronick (referenced in Lesson 4) suggests that 'perfect' attunement between parent and child occurs approximately what percentage of the time in healthy relationships?",
            "options": [
                "100%—perfection is required for secure attachment",
                "Around 30%—the rest of the time is spent in mismatch and repair",
                "Exactly 50%—a balanced split between connection and disconnection",
                "Over 90%—mismatches are rare in conscious parenting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tronick's research shows that even in secure attachments, parents are 'out of sync' about 70% of the time. The strength of the bond comes from the frequency and quality of the repair, not the absence of rupture."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark of 'Power-With' parenting rather than 'Power-Over' parenting (Lesson 5)?",

                "Using 'Because I said so' to establish authority",
                "Relying on fear of consequences to drive behavior",

                "Withdrawing affection until the child complies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'Power-With' focuses on relational influence and collaboration, seeking solutions that respect the needs and autonomy of both parties rather than using dominance to force compliance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6, how does the experience of 'Shame' impact a child's brain during a conflict?",
            "options": [
                "It activates the prefrontal cortex, helping them think about their mistakes",
                "It triggers the 'threat response' and causes the prefrontal cortex to 'go offline'",
                "It increases oxytocin, making the child more likely to seek a hug",
                "It has no measurable effect on brain activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shame is perceived by the brain as a threat to social survival. This triggers a survival response (amygdala) and shuts down the prefrontal cortex, making it impossible for the child to learn or use logic in that moment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Mindful Presence' is defined as the ability to:",

                "Always have the right answer for every parenting dilemma",
                "Be physically present in the room while multitasking on a phone",
                "Bring non-judgmental awareness to the present moment and the child's internal state",
                "Strictly follow a meditation schedule every morning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindful presence in kinship involves being fully 'with' the child, observing their internal experience without the interference of the parent's own projections or judgments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "When applying the 'Kinship in Crisis' de-escalation techniques (Lesson 8), what is the first priority during a child's 'meltdown'?",
            "options": [
                "Explaining why the child's behavior is inappropriate",
                "Ensuring the parent's own nervous system is regulated",
                "Sending the child to 'time-out' to think about their actions",
                "Immediately finding a solution to the problem that caused the meltdown"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "You cannot coregulate a child if you are dysregulated. The first step in de-escalation is 'Self-Regulation'—the parent must stabilize their own nervous system first."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A parent accidentally yells at their child. Following the 'Rupture-Repair' cycle (Lesson 4), what is the most effective way to repair the bond?",
            "options": [
                "Pretend it didn't happen and be extra nice later",
                "Tell the child: 'I wouldn't have yelled if you had just listened'",
                "Wait for the child to apologize for triggering the yell",
                "Acknowledge the yell, take responsibility for the reaction, and reconnect emotionally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Effective repair requires the parent to take full responsibility for their behavior (without blaming the child's trigger) and focus on restoring the emotional connection."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which phrase best embodies the 'Connect before Correct' principle found throughout Module 4?",
            "options": [
                "Behavior is the language of an unmet need or a dysregulated state",
                "Children should be seen and not heard",
                "Consistency in punishment is the key to respect",
                "Empathy is a reward for good behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Conscious Kinship views behavior as communication. By connecting with the underlying need or state first, the parent can then effectively guide or 'correct' the behavior from a place of safety."
