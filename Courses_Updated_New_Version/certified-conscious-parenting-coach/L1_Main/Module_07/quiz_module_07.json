            "question": "According to the Neurobiology of Co-Regulation (Lesson 1), what is the primary function of 'Ventral Vagal' activation in the parent-child kinship bond?",
            "options": [
                "To trigger the 'fight or flight' response for safety",
                "To facilitate a state of social engagement and emotional safety",
                "To shut down the child's emotional outbursts through authority",
                "To increase cortisol levels to improve focus and attention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'social engagement system' which allows both parent and child to feel safe, connected, and emotionally regulated."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In the context of Generational Trauma (Lesson 2), what does the term 'Epigenetic Inheritance' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The literal changing of DNA sequences due to trauma",
                "The psychological mimicry of a parent's behavior by a child",
                "Chemical modifications to DNA that change gene expression without altering the sequence",
                "The legal inheritance of property within a traumatized family"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics involves chemical 'tags' (like methylation) that turn genes on or off based on environmental stressors, which can be passed down through generations."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Radical Witnessing (Lesson 3) requires the parent to distinguish between 'Observation' and 'Interpretation.' Which of the following is a pure observation?",
            "options": [
                "The child is being disrespectful and manipulative",
                "The child is throwing a tantrum because they are tired",
                "The child's voice reached 85 decibels and they are lying on the floor",
                "The child is trying to push my buttons on purpose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Observations are objective facts (decibel level, physical position) without the added layer of judgment or 'why' (disrespect, manipulation, intent)."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses Developmental Alignment. At what approximate age does the Prefrontal Cortex—responsible for impulse control and logic—reach full maturity?",
            "options": [
                "Age 7, when children start formal schooling",
                "Age 12, at the onset of puberty",
                "Age 18, when they reach legal adulthood",
                "Mid-20s, typically between ages 24 and 26"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Prefrontal Cortex is the last part of the brain to develop, meaning parents must align their expectations to the reality that children lack full biological impulse control until their mid-20s."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Internal Boundaries' are defined as:",

                "The strict 'no-contact' rules during a time-out"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal boundaries are about the parent's self-regulation; they prevent the parent from 'leaking' their emotions onto the child or taking the child's behavior personally."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",

            "options": [
                "Explaining the logical reasons why their behavior is wrong",
                "Using 'Why' questions to get the child to analyze their feelings",
                "Reflective listening that names the emotion (e.g., 'It looks like you feel frustrated')",
                "Ignoring the child until they can speak calmly and rationally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening ('Name it to Tame it') helps shift brain activity from the emotional amygdala to the linguistic centers of the brain, aiding regulation."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "A coaching client is in the 'Resistance' phase of the AWAKEN transition (Lesson 7). They state: 'This conscious parenting is just let-them-do-whatever-they-want parenting.' What is the coach's best response?",
            "options": [
                "Agree that it can be permissive and suggest more discipline",
                "Validate the fear of losing control while clarifying the difference between connection and permissiveness",
                "Tell the client they aren't ready for the program",
                "Provide a list of 20 new rules for the client to implement immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance often stems from a fear of losing 'control.' Coaches must validate the feeling while educating the parent on the 'middle path' between authoritarianism and permissiveness."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "When 'Designing the Conscious Home Environment' (Lesson 8), which sensory factor is most likely to contribute to 'Family Overstimulation'?",
            "options": [
                "Consistent daily routines and predictable transitions",
                "High-contrast visual clutter and constant background noise (TV/Loud toys)",
                "The use of soft lighting and 'calm down' corners",
                "Open communication and designated 'quiet hours'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Conscious Home' minimizes sensory triggers like clutter and noise, which can keep both parents and children in a state of low-level chronic stress."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in the module found that parents who practiced 'Radical Witnessing' for just 10 minutes a day reported what percentage decrease in 'parental burnout' scores?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "32%",
                "50%",
                "65%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that even small, consistent doses of non-judgmental observation (Radical Witnessing) significantly reduce the psychological load of parenting."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A parent is struggling with a 4-year-old's 'defiance.' Using Developmental Alignment (Lesson 4), the coach should remind the parent that 4-year-olds:",
            "options": [
                "Are intentionally trying to embarrass the parent in public",
                "Have the cognitive capacity to fully understand long-term consequences",
                "Are in a developmental stage of 'Individuation' where 'No' is a tool for self-discovery",
                "Should be able to sit still and be quiet for at least 60 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuation is a healthy developmental milestone. 'Defiance' at age 4 is often a sign of the child testing their own agency and boundaries, not a personal attack on the parent."
