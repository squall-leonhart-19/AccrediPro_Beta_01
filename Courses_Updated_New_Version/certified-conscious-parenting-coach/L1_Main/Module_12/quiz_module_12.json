            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "According to the Polyvagal Theory discussed in Lesson 1, which state must a parent's nervous system be in to effectively facilitate co-regulation with a child?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic activation (Fight/Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal shutdown (Freeze)",
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement System)",
                "Functional Freeze (High-functioning dissociation)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' state. Only when a parent is in this state can they transmit safety to the child's nervous system, allowing for co-regulation."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Subconscious Parental Scripts' are often referred to as 'Ghosts in the Nursery.' What is the primary indicator that a script is currently being activated?",
            "options": [
                "The parent feels a sense of calm curiosity about the child's behavior.",
                "The parent's emotional reaction is disproportionate to the actual event.",
                "The child follows instructions immediately without resistance.",
                "The parent uses logical reasoning to explain the house rules."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disproportionate emotional reactions (intensity that doesn't match the trigger) usually indicate that a subconscious script or past trauma is being projected onto the current situation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 explains that the 'remodeling' of the adolescent brain involves 'synaptic pruning.' What is the primary purpose of this neurological process?",
            "options": [
                "To decrease the speed of neural transmission to prevent overstimulation.",
                "To increase the size of the amygdala for better emotional processing.",
                "To eliminate unused neural pathways to make the brain more efficient.",
                "To stop the production of dopamine during the teenage years."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synaptic pruning is a 'use it or lose it' process where the brain removes weaker connections to strengthen and streamline the most used pathways, increasing efficiency."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "During a power struggle (Lesson 4), what is the primary goal of 'Alignment in Crisis'?",

                "Explaining the logic of the parent's position until the child agrees."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alignment in Crisis focuses on maintaining the relationship and nervous system stability rather than 'winning,' as logical reasoning is impossible when both parties are dysregulated."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "The 'Empathy-Boundary Paradox' (Lesson 5) suggests that a boundary without empathy usually results in:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Boundaries without empathy are perceived as cold or authoritarian, leading to disconnection. Conversely, empathy without boundaries leads to enabling."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 introduces the 'HERO' model for building Psychological Capital. What do the letters in HERO stand for?",

            "options": [
                "A calculated attempt to manipulate the parent.",
                "A lack of discipline and moral character.",
                "A biological stress response or a survival strategy.",
                "A developmental delay that requires clinical medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed parenting shifts the perspective from 'What is wrong with you?' to 'What happened to you?', seeing behavior as a survival-based response to perceived threat."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the AWAKEN Method (Lesson 8), 'Integration' refers to the ability to:",

                "Combine conscious parenting theory with consistent daily practice.",
                "Forget past mistakes and start over every morning.",
                "Use different parenting styles for different children."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is the final stage where the parent moves from 'learning' to 'being,' making conscious awareness a natural, sustained part of their identity and daily life."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A 15-year-old is experiencing high emotional volatility and risk-taking behavior. Based on Lesson 3, this is most likely due to the developmental gap between which two brain regions?",
            "options": [
                "The Occipital Lobe and the Temporal Lobe",
                "The Limbic System (Amygdala) and the Prefrontal Cortex",

                "The Left Hemisphere and the Right Hemisphere"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'developmental gap' occurs because the emotional Limbic System is fully developed, while the logical, impulse-controlling Prefrontal Cortex is not fully online until the mid-20s."

            "id": "q12_10",

                "Telling the child they shouldn't feel sad because the situation wasn't that bad.",
                "Ignoring the child's emotional outburst to show that it doesn't affect the parent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Holding space means validating the emotion (empathy) while allowing the natural consequence or requirement to remain (boundary), thereby avoiding enabling."
