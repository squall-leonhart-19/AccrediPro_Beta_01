            "question": "In Lesson 1, what is identified as the fundamental shift when moving from 'Compliance-Based' to 'Conscious' Conflict Resolution?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing on the immediate cessation of the behavior through consequences",
                "Shifting focus from controlling the child's behavior to understanding the underlying unmet need",
                "Using time-outs to allow the parent to regain emotional control",
                "Implementing a reward system for positive behavior during conflicts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious conflict resolution prioritizes the relational connection and the root cause of the behavior over external compliance or behavioral control."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of co-regulation (Lesson 2), what must occur for a parent to effectively 'anchor' a dysregulated child?",
            "options": [
                "The parent must use a firm, loud voice to command attention",
                "The parent must remain within their own 'Window of Tolerance' to activate mirror neurons for safety",
                "The parent must ignore the child's behavior until the child calms down independently",
                "The parent must immediately explain the logic of why the child's behavior is incorrect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation relies on the parent's regulated nervous system providing a 'blueprint' for the child's nervous system via mirror neurons and ventral vagal activation."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "When applying the A.W.A.K.E.N. lens to sibling dynamics (Lesson 3), what does the 'W' (Witnessing) specifically require of the parent?",
            "options": [
                "Acting as a judge to determine who started the conflict",
                "Writing down the sequence of events for a later discussion",
                "Observing the emotional experience of both children without immediate intervention or bias",
                "Warning the children of the consequences if the fighting continues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Witnessing involves holding space for both children's perspectives and emotions without rushing to 'fix' the problem or assign blame."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 distinguishes between 'Healthy Remorse' and 'Toxic Guilt.' Which of the following best describes Toxic Guilt?",
            "options": [
                "A behavior-focused feeling that motivates the parent to make a repair",
                "An identity-based shame that whispers 'I am a bad parent' and leads to paralysis",
                "A temporary feeling of regret after losing one's temper",
                "A cognitive realization that a parenting strategy was ineffective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Toxic guilt is internalized as a character flaw ('I am bad'), whereas healthy remorse focuses on the action ('I did something wrong') and facilitates growth."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "In the context of Conscious Boundaries (Lesson 5), how is a boundary differentiated from a 'punishment'?",
            "options": [
                "A boundary is designed to make the child feel the weight of their choice",
                "A boundary is a proactive tool for safety and relational integrity, not a reactive tool for retribution",
                "A boundary is only effective if it involves the removal of a privilege",
                "A boundary is a verbal warning given three times before an action is taken"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious boundaries are 'fences of safety' that protect the child and the relationship, whereas punishments are intended to cause distress to enforce compliance."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Relational Kinship' through play. What neurochemical shift occurs during child-led, 'floor-time' play?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in Cortisol to improve the child's focus",
                "A decrease in Oxytocin to allow for independent exploration",
                "An increase in Dopamine and Oxytocin, which lowers the stress response and builds 'felt safety'",
                "A spike in Adrenaline to help the child develop competitive skills"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Play serves as a biological 'reset,' flooding the system with bonding hormones (Oxytocin) and reward chemicals (Dopamine), which strengthens the attachment bond."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "What is the primary indicator that a parent is experiencing a 'Generational Trauma Trigger' (Lesson 7)?",
            "options": [
                "The parent feels a calm sense of authority",
                "The parent's emotional reaction is disproportionately intense compared to the child's actual behavior",
                "The parent is able to clearly articulate the child's developmental needs",
                "The child responds immediately to the parent's request"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generational triggers are marked by 'emotional flooding' where the parent's reaction is fueled by their own past wounds rather than the present moment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "When integrating the A.W.A.K.E.N. method into daily rituals (Lesson 8), why is the 'A' (Attunement) critical during transitions like bedtime?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the parent to enforce the schedule more strictly",
                "It helps the parent sense the child's internal state (anxiety, fatigue) and adjust the rhythm accordingly",
                "It ensures the child finishes their chores before sleep",
                "It provides a way to distract the child from their emotions so they sleep faster"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attunement allows the parent to 'read the room' and the child's nervous system, making transitions smoother by meeting the child where they are emotionally."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A parent in your coaching session expresses deep shame about 'failing' because they yelled at their child. Based on Lesson 4, what is the most 'Conscious' coaching response?",
            "options": [
                "Agree that yelling is harmful and they should try harder next time",
                "Encourage them to ignore the guilt and move on",
                "Reframe the moment as an opportunity for 'Repair,' explaining that the repair is more vital for development than perfection",
                "Suggest a stricter discipline plan for the child so the parent doesn't get frustrated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Perfect Parent' mythos is dismantled by focusing on 'Repair' (the 'R' in A.W.A.K.E.N.), which teaches the child about resilience and reconciliation."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which physiological system is a coach helping a parent access when they teach 'Somatic Awareness' during a trigger (Lesson 7)?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System (Fight or Flight)",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex of the Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "The HPA Axis (Stress Response)",
                "The Amygdala's 'Emotional Hijack' pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic awareness helps the parent move out of the 'survival brain' (Sympathetic) and back into the 'social engagement system' (Ventral Vagal) where conscious parenting is possible."
