            "question": "According to the Advanced Neurobiology lesson (L1), what does 'Neuroception' describe in the context of relational safety?",
            "options": [
                "The conscious cognitive appraisal of a child's behavior.",
                "The subconscious detection of safety, danger, or life-threat through the nervous system.",
                "The ability to memorize emotional triggers from childhood.",
                "The physical growth of the prefrontal cortex during adolescence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is a term coined by Dr. Stephen Porges to describe how the neural circuits distinguish whether situations or people are safe, dangerous, or life-threatening without the need for conscious thought."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Shadow Work' involves identifying the 'Disowned Child.' What is the primary indicator that a parent is projecting a shadow onto their child?",

                "The parent feels a sense of calm curiosity about the child's behavior.",
                "The parent experiences an intense, disproportionate emotional reaction to a specific behavior.",
                "The parent provides logical consequences for a broken rule.",
                "The child mimics the parent's positive traits."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An intense, visceral, or 'outsized' emotional reaction (trigger) is the hallmark of projection, indicating that the child's behavior is activating a repressed or disowned part of the parent's own psyche."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Containment is about being the 'sturdy leader' who provides a safe space for a child's emotional storm, holding the boundary with empathy rather than trying to suppress the emotion through control."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In conscious parenting, conflict is an opportunity for alchemy—transforming a struggle into kinship by prioritizing the relationship and understanding the 'why' behind the behavior."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent children often process the world through a sensitive nervous system; therefore, we must address sensory and physiological safety (bottom-up) before the child can access their logical brain (top-down)."

            "options": [
                "Offspring are born with fixed stress responses that cannot be changed by parenting.",
                "High-nurturing behaviors (licking/grooming) in mother rats actually changed the gene expression in the offspring, lowering their lifetime stress response.",
                "Only biological parents can influence the epigenetics of their children.",
                "Stress is only passed down through the father's lineage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study proved that the environment (nurturing care) could 'switch' gene expression, showing that conscious parenting can literally break generational chains at a cellular level."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious communication in crisis requires being honest and transparent enough to validate the child's reality while maintaining the 'Nurturing Container' so the child doesn't feel responsible for adult problems."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
