            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 1), what must occur biologically before a child can access their 'Social Engagement System' during a meltdown?",
            "options": [
                "The child must be given a clear consequence to trigger the prefrontal cortex.",
                "The parent must embody a Ventral Vagal state to provide a 'neuroceptive' cue of safety.",
                "The child must reach the 'Dorsal Vagal' state of total shutdown first.",
                "The parent must use firm vocal commands to interrupt the Sympathetic nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation requires the parent to be in a Ventral Vagal state (calm, connected) so the child's nervous system can 'borrow' that regulation through neuroception."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Martyr' archetype is described as a parent who sacrifices their own needs to the point of resentment. What is the primary psychological impact on the child?",
            "options": [
                "The child becomes highly independent and self-sufficient.",
                "The child feels a deep sense of gratitude and develops high empathy.",
                "The child feels burdened by the parent's emotional state and may develop 'enmeshment' or 'caretaker' tendencies.",
                "The child learns the importance of self-care through observation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Martyr archetype creates a 'debt' that the child can never pay, often leading the child to feel responsible for the parent's happiness and suppressing their own needs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 emphasizes a 'Bottom-Up' approach for neurodivergent children. Why are 'Top-Down' strategies (like logic or rewards) often ineffective during sensory overload?",
            "options": [
                "Neurodivergent children lack the cognitive capacity for logic.",
                "Sensory overload causes a 'functional disconnection' where the subcortical brain overrides the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex.",
                "Rewards are only effective for neurotypical children due to dopamine receptor variations.",
                "Logic requires a Dorsal Vagal state which neurodivergent children rarely reach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During sensory or emotional overload, the 'bottom' (survival) brain takes over, making 'top-down' (logical/cognitive) strategies inaccessible until the nervous system is regulated."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Rupture and Repair, what is the 'Mastery' level of repair after a parent has lost their temper?",
            "options": [
                "Waiting until the child apologizes for their part in the conflict first.",
                "Explaining to the child exactly why their behavior caused the parent to explode.",
                "Taking 100% responsibility for the reaction without adding a 'but' or mentioning the child's behavior.",
                "Buying the child a gift to restore the positive association of the relationship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "True repair involves the parent taking full ownership of their emotional regulation failure, which models accountability and removes the burden of shame from the child."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "When coaching a parent with a non-aligned, 'traditional' co-parent (Lesson 5), what is the most effective 'Bridge' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Sending the co-parent scientific articles to prove they are wrong.",
                "Focusing on 'Parallel Parenting' where the client models regulation without trying to change the other parent's methods.",
                "Insisting that the child only follows the conscious parenting rules at both houses.",
                "Asking the child to 'report back' on the other parent's behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In non-aligned situations, the coach helps the client focus on their own 'Circle of Control.' Modeling regulation creates a safe harbor for the child, which is more effective than high-conflict coercion of the co-parent."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses the neuroscience of generational healing. What role does the 'Medial Prefrontal Cortex' (mPFC) play in breaking toxic cycles?",
            "options": [
                "It stores the traumatic memories of the ancestors.",
                "It is responsible for the 'freeze' response during parenting triggers.",
                "It provides the 'inhibitory control' needed to pause between a trigger and a reactive generational habit.",
                "It is the part of the brain that produces cortisol during stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The mPFC is crucial for self-regulation and 'response flexibility,' allowing a parent to choose a conscious response rather than a reflexive, generational reaction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Conscious Discipline' is contrasted with 'Traditional Discipline.' What is the primary driver of behavior in a Conscious Discipline framework?",
            "options": [
                "Fear of consequences.",
                "The desire for external rewards (stickers, toys).",
                "Intrinsic motivation rooted in relational safety and values.",
                "Compliance with social norms and authority."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Conscious discipline moves away from fear-based control and toward helping the child understand the 'why' behind their actions, fostering internal values and intrinsic motivation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "During the 'Final Integration' phase of the 12-week transformation (Lesson 8), what is the coach's primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "To provide the client with a new set of scripts for every possible scenario.",
                "To move the client from 'conscious competence' to 'unconscious competence' and self-led correction.",
                "To ensure the client never has another 'rupture' with their child.",
                "To extend the coaching contract for another 12 weeks of support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of the final weeks is 'sustainable embodiment,' where the parent has the tools to recognize their own triggers and repair ruptures without needing constant coach intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that children of parents who practice 'Mindful Parenting' (a core of Conscious Parenting) show significantly lower levels of which hormone?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Cortisol",
                "Serotonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that mindful, regulated parenting correlates with lower baseline cortisol (the stress hormone) levels in children, indicating a more regulated nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client complains that their 6-year-old is 'manipulating' them by crying when they don't get their way. Based on Lesson 7, how should the coach reframe this?",
            "options": [
                "The child is using high-level tactical manipulation to gain power.",
                "The child is experiencing an 'unmet need' or 'under-developed skill' and is communicating through the only means available to their nervous system.",
                "The child has been 'spoiled' by too much conscious parenting and needs firmer boundaries.",
                "The child is likely in a 'Savior' archetype role."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious parenting reframes 'manipulation' as communication. A 6-year-old lacks the neurological complexity for malicious manipulation; they are simply expressing a need or a lack of regulation."
