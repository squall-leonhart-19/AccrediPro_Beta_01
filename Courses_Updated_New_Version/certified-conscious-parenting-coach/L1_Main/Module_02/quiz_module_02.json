            "question": "In the transition from 'Evaluator' to 'Witness,' what is the primary shift in the parent's internal orientation?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from fixing the behavior to ignoring the behavior",
                "Moving from judging a child's character to observing their experience without labels",
                "Moving from permissive parenting to strict boundary setting",
                "Moving from emotional detachment to over-identification with the child's pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The core of Witnessing is moving from an 'Evaluator' who labels behavior as good or bad, to a 'Witness' who observes the child's internal state and external actions with neutral curiosity."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Iceberg Metaphor' of behavior discussed in Lesson 2, what does the visible tip of the iceberg represent?",
            "options": [
                "The child's unmet physiological needs",
                "The parent's childhood triggers",
                "The observable behavior (the 'what')",
                "The underlying emotional driver (the 'why')"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The visible tip represents the observable behavior, such as hitting or screaming. The 'Witness' looks below the waterline to find the feelings, needs, and neurological states driving that behavior."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the 'Physiology of Presence' emphasizes co-regulation. What is required for a parent to effectively co-regulate with a child in distress?",
            "options": [
                "The parent must have a more dominant voice to command attention",
                "The parent must ignore the child until the child calms down",
                "The parent must maintain a regulated nervous system to act as an external 'anchor'",
                "The parent must mirror the child's high-energy emotional state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation occurs when a regulated nervous system (the parent) provides a sense of safety that helps calm a dysregulated nervous system (the child)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "H.A.L.T.S. stands for Hungry, Angry/Anxious, Lonely, Tired, and Stressed/Sick. These are the primary physiological and emotional 'filters' that often drive 'misbehavior'."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A parent says, 'My daughter is being manipulative by crying just to get her way.' According to Lesson 5, which part of this statement is the 'Narrative'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Reality' is that the daughter is crying. The 'Narrative' is the parent's interpretation that the crying is 'manipulative,' which adds a layer of judgment and intent that may not be true."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Based on the concept of 'The Space Between' (Lesson 6), what is the primary goal of the Witnessing Pause?",
            "options": [
                "To give the parent time to come up with a clever punishment",
                "To allow the child to 'cry it out' without intervention",
                "To create a gap between the stimulus and the response where choice resides",
                "To ensure the parent wins the power struggle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inspired by Viktor Frankl, the pause allows the parent to move out of an automatic, reactive state and into a conscious, chosen response."

                "The prefrontal cortex is fully developed by age 7",
                "Toddlers have the same impulse control as adults but choose not to use it",
                "The Limbic system (emotional center) is often online long before the Prefrontal Cortex (rational center)",
                "Children are incapable of feeling empathy until they reach puberty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Understanding that the 'downstairs brain' (limbic system) is functional while the 'upstairs brain' (prefrontal cortex) is still under construction helps parents align their expectations with reality."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When coaching a client who is stuck in 'Evaluator' mode, which question best facilitates the 'Witness' perspective?",
            "options": [
                "'Why do you think your child is trying to ruin your day?'",
                "'What are the objective facts of what happened, without using adjectives?'",
                "'How do you plan to punish this behavior next time?'",
                "'Do you think you are being too soft on your child?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asking for 'objective facts without adjectives' helps the client strip away the narrative and return to neutral witnessing."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the module suggests that what percentage of 'defiant' behavior in children under 10 is linked to physiological dysregulation rather than intentional malice?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Over 85%",
                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes that the vast majority of 'misbehavior' (upwards of 85%) is a physiological response to stress, unmet needs, or lack of skills, rather than a character flaw."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",

                "Use 'The 2-Minute Rule'—if you can't fix it in 2 minutes, walk away",
                "Focus on your own exhale to signal safety to your own nervous system",
                "Immediately explain to the child why their behavior is illogical",
                "Distract the child with a screen or sugar to stop the noise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on the exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system, allowing the parent to stay grounded and provide the 'anchor' needed for co-regulation."
