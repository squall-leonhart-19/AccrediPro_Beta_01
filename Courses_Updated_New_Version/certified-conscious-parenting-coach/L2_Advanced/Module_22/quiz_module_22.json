            "question": "A client begins sharing details of deep-seated childhood trauma that is causing current dissociative episodes. According to Lesson 1 on Scope of Practice, what is the most ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Attempt to use conscious parenting techniques to heal the inner child trauma immediately.",
                "Acknowledge the experience but explain that clinical dissociation falls outside the coaching scope and provide a referral to a licensed therapist.",
                "Ignore the dissociative episodes and keep the focus strictly on the child's current behavior.",
                "Suggest the client stop taking any prescribed medications to better 'feel' the trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious parenting coaches must recognize the boundary between coaching (future-oriented growth) and therapy (treating clinical pathologies like dissociation). Referring out is a requirement when a client's needs exceed the coach's professional scope."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mandatory reporters are not required to prove abuse; they are required to report when they have a 'reasonable suspicion.' The investigation is the responsibility of the state, not the coach."

                "Impose Western psychological standards as the only 'correct' way to parent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural competence and humility involve respecting the client's cultural context and avoiding 'cultural imperialism'—the imposition of the coach's own cultural values onto the client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the coach projects their own unresolved emotions, history, or 'ego' onto the client, often triggered by a resemblance to someone from the coach's past."

        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Ethical Marketing.' Which of the following claims would be considered an ethical violation for a Conscious Parenting Coach?",
            "options": [
                "'I help parents develop greater emotional regulation.'",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A coach is asked by a close personal friend to provide professional coaching services. Based on the module's guidelines on 'Dual Relationships,' the coach should:",
            "options": [
                "Accept the friend as a client but charge double the normal rate.",
                "Accept the friend but agree not to talk about personal things anymore.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships (being both a friend and a coach) are ethically risky because they can blur boundaries, impair the coach's objectivity, and potentially harm the existing friendship."
