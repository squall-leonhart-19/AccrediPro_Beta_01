            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Conscious parenting shifts the focus from managing outward behavior to understanding the underlying physiological state of the nervous system and the sensory environment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Unified Field focuses on the parent's ability to remain a 'regulated anchor' for the child, creating a field of safety that is independent of the co-parent's volatility."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing the child with the sensory input their body is craving (the 'Sensory Diet') helps regulate their nervous system and reduces the need for disruptive seeking behaviors."

            "question": "In the 'Adolescent Autonomy Shift' (L4), why is 'Connection before Correction' particularly critical?",
            "options": [
                "Because adolescents have no sense of logic and can only be reached through emotion.",
                "Because without a felt sense of connection, the adolescent will perceive correction as an attack on their autonomy.",
                "Because it allows the parent to manipulate the teen more effectively.",
                "Because adolescents are too fragile to handle direct feedback."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During individuation, the teen's primary drive is autonomy. If correction comes without connection, it triggers a defensive 'fight' response to protect their developing sense of self."
