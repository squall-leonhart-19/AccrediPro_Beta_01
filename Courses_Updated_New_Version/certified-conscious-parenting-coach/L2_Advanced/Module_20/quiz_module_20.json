            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "In the AWAKEN Assessment Framework, which stage focuses specifically on the parent's ability to observe a child's behavior without immediate judgment or projection?",
            "options": ["Awareness", "Witnessing", "Alignment", "Kinship"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Witnessing (the 'W' in AWAKEN) involves objective behavioral observation protocols designed to separate the child's actual behavior from the parent's internal narrative or emotional triggers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A coach is helping a client identify why they feel intense 'phantom' anger when their child refuses to eat. Which assessment tool is most appropriate for this specific exploration?",
            "options": ["Ritual Audit", "Boundary Benchmarking", "Generational Audit", "ABC Behavioral Protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Generational Audit helps parents identify inherited emotional patterns and 'phantom' triggers that stem from their own upbringing rather than the present moment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When utilizing the 'Trigger Mapping' tool in Lesson 2, what are the three primary categories of triggers coaches must help parents identify?",
            "options": ["Somatic, Environmental, and Relational", "Physical, Mental, and Spiritual", "Financial, Social, and Parental", "Historical, Current, and Future"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Trigger mapping focuses on Somatic (body sensations), Environmental (external noise/clutter), and Relational (specific interactions) cues that lead to dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "The ABC Protocol used in Behavioral Observation (Lesson 3) stands for which of the following sequences?",
            "options": ["Action, Belief, Consequence", "Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence", "Affect, Behavior, Connection", "Assessment, Blueprint, Correction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ABC Protocol tracks the Antecedent (what happened before), the Behavior (what the child did), and the Consequence (how the parent responded/what followed)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Authentic Essence Discovery' tools are used primarily to distinguish between which two factors?",
            "options": ["Good behavior and bad behavior", "The child's innate temperament and the parent's projections", "Academic success and emotional intelligence", "Biological needs and psychological wants"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alignment tools help parents strip away their 'idealized' version of the child to see and support the child's true, innate temperament and essence."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "According to the Kinship: Relational Safety & Co-Regulation Scales (Lesson 5), what is the 'Primary Indicator' of high relational safety?",
            "options": ["The child never displays tantrums", "The parent always maintains a soft voice", "The child seeks the parent for comfort during dysregulation", "The parent uses logical consequences for every mistake"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Relational safety is measured by the child's willingness to move toward the parent (proximity seeking) when they are in a state of vulnerability or distress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "In Boundary Benchmarking (Lesson 6), a 'Rigid' boundary is typically characterized by which of the following parent-child dynamics?",
            "options": ["Mutual respect and flexibility", "High control with low emotional warmth", "Lack of structure and high anxiety", "Collaborative problem solving"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rigid boundaries prioritize compliance and control over the emotional connection, often leading to a 'power-over' rather than 'power-with' dynamic."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "During a 'Ritual Audit' (Lesson 7), a coach discovers that a family's bedtime routine is efficient but high-stress. What is the likely 'Synthesis' recommendation?",
            "options": ["Increase the speed of the routine to get more sleep", "Introduce a 'connection-before-compliance' micro-ritual", "Implement a stricter punishment for stalling", "Eliminate the routine entirely for one week"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ritual Audits look for the 'Emotional ROI.' If a ritual is efficient but lacks connection, the recommendation is to infuse it with micro-rituals that foster safety and intimacy."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "When synthesizing data for a Custom Coaching Roadmap (Lesson 8), which area should almost always be addressed first if the assessment shows high dysregulation?",
            "options": ["Communication Skills", "Advanced Rituals", "Somatic Self-Regulation", "Academic Goal Setting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis principles dictate that physiological safety and somatic regulation are the foundation; you cannot coach communication or rituals effectively if the parent's nervous system is constantly in 'fight or flight.' "
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Permissive' boundary scores and low 'Co-Regulation' scores. What is the most likely outcome if this is not addressed in the Roadmap?",
            "options": ["The child will become overly independent", "The parent will experience burnout and the child will feel unsafe", "The family will achieve higher levels of creativity", "The child's academic performance will improve"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low boundaries combined with low co-regulation typically lead to parental burnout and a lack of 'containment' for the child, which the child perceives as a lack of safety."
