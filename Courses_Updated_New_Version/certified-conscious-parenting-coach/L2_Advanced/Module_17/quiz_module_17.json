            "question": "In high-conflict divorce scenarios (Lesson 1), when 'Co-parenting' leads to constant litigation and emotional distress, what alternative model does the Conscious Parenting Coach recommend to protect the child's equilibrium?",
            "options": [
                "Enmeshed Parenting",
                "Parallel Parenting",
                "Counter-Parenting",
                "Mediated Parenting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel parenting is a method where each parent has their own individual parenting style and rules when the child is with them, with minimal direct contact between parents to reduce conflict and shield the child from toxic interactions."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Neurodiversity, what is the fundamental shift a coach must facilitate for parents of children with ADHD or ASD?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from 'behavioral modification' to 'nervous system regulation'",
                "Moving from 'unstructured play' to 'strict compliance training'",
                "Moving from 'sensory integration' to 'exposure therapy'",
                "Moving from 'medical models' to 'purely spiritual explanations'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Conscious coaching emphasizes that neurodivergent 'behaviors' are often physiological responses to an overwhelmed nervous system; therefore, regulation must precede any behavioral expectations."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the 'ACE Study' (Adverse Childhood Experiences). Which of the following is a 'Trauma-Informed' coaching strategy when working with a parent who has a high ACE score?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on the child's behavior to avoid triggering the parent",
                "Using 'top-down' cognitive logic to explain why their past doesn't matter",
                "Prioritizing 'bottom-up' regulation to soothe the parent's overactive amygdala",
                "Encouraging the parent to suppress memories to stay present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed coaching uses 'bottom-up' approaches (somatic and sensory regulation) because a traumatized brain cannot access 'top-down' logic (prefrontal cortex) when it is in a state of survival."

            "id": "q17_4",

                "The healthy siblings of a child with special needs who feel 'looked through' by parents",
                "Children who have been shielded from all forms of adversity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Glass Child' phenomenon occurs when the needs of a sibling with a disability or illness consume so much parental energy that the 'healthy' child's needs become invisible."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 5 (Grief and Loss), how do children under the age of 5 typically process the death of a loved one?",
            "options": [
                "They experience a permanent, adult-like understanding of finality",
                "They view death as temporary or reversible and may ask when the person is coming back",
                "They rarely show any signs of grief due to lack of emotional development",
                "They only experience grief if they witness the death directly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developmentally, children under 5 often lack the concept of 'irreversibility' and 'non-functionality,' leading them to view death as a temporary absence or sleep-like state."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 regarding Adolescent Crisis, what is the coach's primary goal when a teen is engaging in substance use?",

                "To help the parent implement a 'Zero Tolerance' punishment system",

                "To force the teen into a confession through confrontation",
                "To ignore the behavior to maintain the parent-child connection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious parenting views high-risk behavior as a 'tragic expression of an unmet need.' The coach helps the parent look beneath the behavior to find the underlying emotional pain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Ghost in the Nursery' represents the unmourned and unintegrated traumas of the parent's past that 'haunt' their current relationship with their child, often leading to reactive parenting."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "According to the Ethics and Crisis Management guidelines in Lesson 8, when must a coach move from a coaching relationship to a mandatory report?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory seekers (hyposensitive) need high-intensity input to feel their bodies in space, often resulting in 'crashing,' 'bumping,' and high-energy movement."

            "id": "q17_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaching focuses on the present and future, relational skills, and regulation. If a client requires clinical treatment for mental health pathologies (PTSD, MDD, etc.), they must be referred to a licensed therapist."
