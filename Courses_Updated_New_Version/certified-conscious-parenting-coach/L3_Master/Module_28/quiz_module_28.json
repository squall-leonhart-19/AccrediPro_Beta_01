            "question": "During a family crisis, the parental 'upstairs brain' (prefrontal cortex) often goes offline. Which physiological system is primarily responsible for the 'fight-flight-freeze' response that drives reactive parenting in these moments?",
            "options": [
                "The HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) Axis",
                "The Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex",
                "The Prefrontal System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The HPA axis is the body's central stress response system. In a crisis, it triggers the release of cortisol and adrenaline, shifting control from the rational prefrontal cortex to the reactive survival brain."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A parent with Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) experiences an intense, disproportionate emotional reaction to their child's mild defiance, feeling suddenly small, helpless, and ashamed. This phenomenon is best described as:",

                "Parental burnout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional flashbacks are a hallmark of C-PTSD. They are intense, sudden regressions to the emotional state of the original trauma, often without a clear visual memory of the event."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel parenting allows high-conflict parents to remain involved in the child's life while minimizing direct contact and communication, effectively creating a 'firewall' between toxic dynamics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PDA is not about 'naughtiness'; it is a profile of autism where the brain perceives demands as threats to safety and autonomy, triggering an immediate survival response."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a loss is not recognized by society as 'legitimate,' making it harder for the individual to find support and move through the mourning process."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches have a 'Duty to Warn' and a legal/ethical obligation to report imminent danger to self or others, as this falls outside the scope of coaching and into crisis intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "No cognitive processing can happen when a client is hyper-aroused. The coach must first help the client regulate their nervous system through grounding and co-regulation."
