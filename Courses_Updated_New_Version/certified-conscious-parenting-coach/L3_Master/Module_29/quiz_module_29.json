            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-syncing, or somatic resonance, is a physiological state where the nervous systems of the parent and child align, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, facilitating deep emotional regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-conflict systems, alignment refers to centering the child's physiological and emotional safety, ensuring the conflict does not further dysregulate the child's nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability in family rituals comes from co-creation and flexibility; rituals that are too rigid often become sources of stress rather than regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In advanced co-regulation, we recognize that over 90% of the 'message' received by a child's nervous system is somatic (tone, posture, energy) rather than the actual words spoken."
