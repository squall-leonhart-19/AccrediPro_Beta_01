            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Limbic Revision' is described as a core mechanism of somatic resonance. What is the primary biological requirement for this process to occur between a coach and a client?",
            "options": [
                "The coach must maintain a state of 'limbic regulation' to provide a stable frequency for the client's nervous system to entrain with.",
                "The coach must use cognitive behavioral interventions to override the client's amygdala response.",
                "The client must be in a state of 'hyper-arousal' for the mirror neurons to fire effectively.",
                "The coach must remain emotionally detached to avoid 'counter-transference' during the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Limbic Revision requires the coach to be in a regulated state; through somatic resonance, the client's dysregulated nervous system can find a new 'set point' by entraining with the coach's stable limbic state."

            "options": [
                "Provide the client with immediate solutions to behavioral problems.",
                "Deconstruct surface-level complaints to uncover the 'core existential fear' or 'root belief' beneath them.",
                "Directly challenge the child's behavior through the parent's perspective.",
                "Avoid emotional discomfort by focusing strictly on logic and rational thought."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Downing the Arrow is a master-level inquiry technique that peels back layers of belief until the foundational 'core belief' (e.g., 'I am unworthy') is exposed for deconstruction."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Disenfranchised Grief' in parenting. Which scenario best exemplifies this concept?",
            "options": [
                "A parent mourning the physical death of a child in a tragic accident.",
                "A parent feeling sad because their child did not make the varsity sports team.",
                "A parent grieving the 'idealized version' of a child following a neurodiversity diagnosis, which society often fails to recognize as valid loss.",
                "A parent feeling guilty for losing their temper during a stressful morning routine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief refers to a loss that is not openly acknowledged, socially sanctioned, or publicly mourned, such as the 'lost expectations' of a parent whose child has different needs than anticipated."

            "id": "q24_4",

            "options": [
                "The child wants to reconcile but the parent refuses out of spite.",
                "The more a parent aggressively pursues a child to end estrangement, the more the child feels pressured and retreats further.",
                "High-conflict parents are actually more likely to stay together than low-conflict parents.",
                "Estrangement is always caused by the child's 'spoiled' upbringing rather than parental behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Reconciliation Paradox suggests that the 'pursuer-distancer' dynamic is amplified in estrangement; the parent's anxious pursuit often triggers the child's need for autonomy and safety, leading to further distance."

                "A parent identifies with their child's positive traits and feels proud.",
                "A parent unconsciously 'deposits' their disowned shame or anger into the child, and the child begins to act out those specific emotions.",
                "The coach projects their own childhood trauma onto the client.",
                "The child copies the parent's behavior through simple imitation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projective Identification is a complex defense mechanism where the parent disowns a part of their 'shadow' and induces the child to experience and manifest that disowned part."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 on Epigenetics highlights that transgenerational trauma can be 'encoded' through DNA methylation. How does the 'Healing Ritual' intervene in this biological process?",
            "options": [
                "It physically alters the DNA sequence of the parent and child.",
                "It provides a 'corrective emotional experience' that lowers cortisol and can trigger positive gene expression (epigenetic shifts) over time.",
                "It is purely symbolic and has no impact on biological markers.",
                "It requires the ancestors to be present to work effectively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While rituals don't change DNA sequences, the shift in environment and emotional safety can influence 'gene expression' (epigenetics), helping to 'turn off' stress-response genes activated by ancestral trauma."

            "id": "q24_7",

                "The coach and client working on the same goal simultaneously.",

                "The coach having two clients with the exact same parenting problem.",
                "The legal requirement to report child abuse in all fifty states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel Process is a supervisory concept where the coach unconsciously reenacts the client's struggles within the supervision relationship, providing a 'live' opportunity to resolve the issue."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "The AWAKEN Legacy framework (Lesson 8) defines the 'E' as 'Embodiment.' What does this look like in a Master Practitioner’s practice?",

                "Focusing exclusively on the child's physical health and nutrition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Embodiment is the hallmark of a Master Practitioner; it is the integration of wisdom into the body, allowing the coach to lead by 'being' rather than just 'doing' or 'teaching.'"

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client is stuck in a loop of 'I am a failure as a mother' because her child is struggling in school. Using Lesson 2's Advanced Socratic Inquiry, which question best targets the 'Evidence' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Why do you think you are such a bad mother?",
                "What specific, objective facts support the conclusion that your child's grades are a direct reflection of your total worth as a parent?",
                "Don't you think you're being a bit dramatic about this?",
                "Have you tried setting a stricter study schedule for your child?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level inquiry challenges the 'logic' of the core belief by asking for objective evidence, helping the client see the cognitive distortion in linking their worth to an external outcome."

            "id": "q24_10",

                "Punish the Scapegoat for their bad behavior.",
                "Help the parent recognize how they are splitting their own 'Good' and 'Bad' shadow parts and projecting them onto the children.",
                "Tell the children that the parent is wrong."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Golden Child/Scapegoat dynamic is a classic systemic projection of the parent's internal 'split' shadow. Healing the system requires the parent to re-integrate these parts within themselves."
