                "Modifying the child's behavior to meet societal norms",
                "Adjusting the environment and parental expectations to match the child's current nervous system capacity",

                "Teaching the child how to adjust their sensory needs to fit the classroom"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Adjust' phase focuses on the 'mismatch' between the child's neurobiology and their environment, requiring the parent to modify external demands rather than forcing the child to mask their neurodivergence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel Parenting allows high-conflict parents to remain involved in the child's life while minimizing contact with each other, effectively reducing the child's exposure to 'Loyalty Binds' and parental friction."

            "options": [
                "That children are resilient and forget early trauma by age three",
                "That the initial separation from the biological mother creates a foundational trauma that impacts attachment regardless of the age of adoption",
                "That physical injuries in early childhood lead to emotional outbursts",
                "That kinship care is always superior to foster care due to genetic ties"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Primal Wound theory (Verrier) posits that the severance of the biological bond is a significant trauma that requires conscious, trauma-informed parenting to heal through consistent attunement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychomotor Overexcitability involves a surplus of energy that manifests as rapid movement, talkativeness, or restlessness, which can be misidentified as ADHD if the 'giftedness' context is ignored."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To avoid the 'Insider/Outsider' trap, stepparents should focus on building a relationship first. Primary discipline should remain with the biological parent until a deep bond of trust is established."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "That individual autonomy is the only goal of parenting",
                "That the child's role is often defined by their contribution to the family and community harmony rather than just 'finding themselves'",
                "That collectivist cultures do not value emotional connection",
                "That Western parenting models should be applied without modification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In collectivist cultures, the 'Self' is intertwined with the family. Conscious parenting here must balance the child's authentic expression with their vital role in the family ecosystem and cultural heritage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity Foreclosure occurs when a child adopts an identity (like 'the star athlete') without exploration, leading to a crisis of worth if they fail or become injured, as they have no 'self' outside of the sport."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "Which 'A.W.A.K.E.N.' step involves the parent identifying their own 'triggers' or sensory 'yucks' when dealing with a neurodivergent child's meltdown?",
