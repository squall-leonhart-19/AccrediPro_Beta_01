            "question": "When applying 'Backward Design' (Wiggins & McTighe) to the Certified Conscious Parenting curriculum, what is the first step in the process?",
            "options": [
                "Selecting the most engaging activities and icebreakers",
                "Identifying the desired results and 'Big Ideas' the parents must understand",
                "Determining which digital platform will host the 12-week program",
                "Writing the weekly email sequences for the participants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Backward Design begins with the end in mind: identifying the specific transformations and understandings (Desired Results) before moving to assessments or learning activities."

            "question": "In the context of scaling the A.W.A.K.E.N. Method™ to group frameworks, what is the primary function of 'Collective Resonance'?",

                "Ensuring that all parents in the group have the exact same parenting style"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collective Resonance leverages the group dynamic to show parents they are not alone, which lowers defenses and accelerates the 'Awakening' process through shared vulnerability."

        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During the 12-week transformation sequence, why is the 'Deconstruction' phase (Weeks 5-8) considered the most volatile?",
            "options": [
                "Because parents are usually bored by the second month",
                "Because it involves dismantling long-held ego defenses and generational patterns",
                "Because this is when the coach introduces the most complex scientific terminology",
                "Because the technical support for digital platforms usually fails at this stage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The middle phase of the 12-week arc involves deep shadow work and deconstructing the 'False Self,' which naturally triggers higher levels of resistance and emotional volatility."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "A coach uses the Parental Self-Efficacy Scale (PSES) to measure mastery. If a client shows a high score in 'Knowledge' but a low score in 'Efficacy,' what does this suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The client is not paying attention to the lessons",
                "The program needs more academic content",
                "The client understands the theory but lacks the confidence or skills to apply it in real-time parenting",
                "The client has already achieved full transformation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A gap between knowledge and efficacy indicates that the 'Transformation Gap' has not been bridged; the client has the information but cannot yet embody the practice."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "To ensure 'Culturally Responsive Content Design,' a coach must move beyond 'Cultural Competence' toward 'Cultural Humility.' What does this look like in practice?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility is an ongoing process of self-reflection and recognizing the power imbalance, rather than just checking boxes of 'competence' or 'representation.'"

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "According to Tuckman's Stages of Group Development, in which stage is a Conscious Parenting Coach most likely to encounter 'The Expert' or 'The Deflector' archetypes challenging the curriculum?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Storming' phase is characterized by conflict and competition as group members test boundaries and the coach's authority; this is where resistance archetypes typically emerge."

            "question": "What is the primary benefit of the 'Flipped Classroom' model in a hybrid delivery system for parenting coaches?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to charge more for 'live' time",
                "It ensures that parents never have to read any materials",
                "It uses asynchronous content for knowledge transfer, leaving live sessions for high-impact coaching and integration",
                "It eliminates the need for a 12-week sequence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Flipped Classroom model optimizes the most valuable resource—live time—for deep work and personalized coaching, while the 'lecturing' happens via pre-recorded content."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "When iterating a program based on data, you find your Net Promoter Score (NPS) is 65. How should you interpret this result?",
            "options": [
                "The program is failing and needs a complete overhaul",
                "The program is performing strongly, as scores between 30-70 are considered 'excellent' in professional services",
                "The score is too low; you should aim for a minimum of 95 to be a certified coach",
                "The NPS is irrelevant to program development"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the coaching and professional development industry, an NPS above 50 is considered excellent, and 70+ is world-class. A score of 65 indicates very high client satisfaction."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A coach notices that group engagement drops significantly in Week 3. Applying the 'Cognitive Load Theory,' what is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "The parents are simply unmotivated",
                "The coach is not using enough 'Coach Tips'",
                "The 'Intrinsic Load' of the concepts is exceeding the parents' 'Germane Load' processing capacity",
                "The parents have already mastered the material"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If engagement drops when complexity increases, it's often because the cognitive load is too high—meaning the information is too dense or the presentation (Extrinsic Load) is too cluttered."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "In the 'Quality Assurance' phase, which 'Feedback Loop' provides the most objective data for program iteration?",
            "options": [
                "The coach's personal intuition about how the group felt",
                "Triangulating pre/post-assessment data, client satisfaction surveys, and session retention rates",
                "Asking one's spouse or partner for their opinion on the workbook",
                "Monitoring how many 'likes' the program gets on social media"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation—using multiple data sources—ensures that iteration is based on objective evidence of transformation and engagement rather than subjective feelings."
