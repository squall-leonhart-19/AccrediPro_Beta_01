            "id": "q34_1",
            "question": "In the S.O.L.A.C.E. Framework for group dynamics (Lesson 1), what does the 'O' stand for and what is its primary function?",
            "options": [
                "Objective Setting: Defining the clinical goals for the session.",
                "Organic Flow: Allowing the group’s collective energy to guide the depth of sharing.",
                "Observation: The facilitator's role in monitoring non-verbal cues.",
                "Openness: The requirement for members to share everything immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Organic Flow refers to the facilitator's ability to balance a structured curriculum with the spontaneous emotional needs of the group, ensuring the process doesn't feel clinical or forced."

        {
            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When designing a multi-session curriculum (Lesson 2), why is Session 4 often referred to as the 'Crucible' or 'Valley' session?",
            "options": [
                "Because attendance is statistically lowest during this week.",
                "Because the introductory 'honeymoon phase' ends and deeper, more painful processing begins.",
                "Because it is the session where the facilitator introduces somatic exercises.",
                "Because it is the midpoint where participants are required to pay their remaining balance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Session 4 is typically where the initial social masks drop and the group enters the 'Storming' or deep processing phase, requiring advanced facilitation to maintain safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "A participant in your group, 'Sarah,' consistently interrupts others to share her own story, a behavior known as 'The Monopolizer.' According to Lesson 3, what is the most effective L4 facilitation response?",
            "options": [
                "Asking Sarah to leave the session to maintain group harmony.",
                "Ignoring the behavior and hoping the group self-corrects.",
                "Using 'Bridge-Building' to validate Sarah’s experience while redirecting the theme to the group’s collective wisdom.",
                "Strictly enforcing a 2-minute timer for every participant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bridge-building allows the facilitator to acknowledge the individual's pain (preventing shame) while skillfully pulling the rest of the group back into the conversation."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Intensives.' What is the primary neurological benefit of a 2-day grief intensive compared to 8 weeks of hourly sessions?",
            "options": [
                "It is more cost-effective for the practitioner.",
                "It prevents the 're-entry' stress associated with weekly sessions.",
                "It leverages a 'compressed neuroplasticity window' by maintaining a state of focused emotional immersion.",
                "It requires less preparation time for the facilitator."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intensives create an immersive environment that can bypass standard cognitive defenses more quickly than intermittent weekly sessions, facilitating deeper shifts in a shorter time."

        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, why is 'Titration' critical when using somatic or expressive arts in a group setting?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure everyone has enough art supplies.",
                "To keep the session moving according to the timed schedule.",
                "To introduce emotional intensity in small, manageable 'doses' to prevent autonomic flooding.",
                "To measure the exact amount of progress a participant makes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is a trauma-informed somatic principle that prevents participants from becoming overwhelmed (flooded) by keeping them within their 'Window of Tolerance.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Virtual Facilitation, what is the 'Digital Third Space'?",

                "The technical support chat available during a webinar.",
                "A backup platform in case the primary video software fails."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Digital Third Space is the intentional 'vibe' or environment the facilitator creates through lighting, tone, and presence that makes a virtual room feel as sacred as a physical one."

            "id": "q34_7",

                "Long-term grief integration scores measured at a 1-year follow-up."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators (like early self-efficacy scores) predict future success, whereas lagging indicators (like graduation rates) confirm success after the fact."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "When scaling a grief support business (Lesson 8), the 'Ascension Model' suggests that a Specialist's 'Core Program' should lead into:",
            "options": [
                "A lower-priced introductory workshop.",
                "A free community support group.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ascension Model moves clients from low-barrier entry points to high-value, high-transformation 'Core' and 'Premium' offerings."

            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Exactly 50%",

                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the 'Universalization'—the realization that one is not alone in their suffering—is a primary driver of healing in group settings, often cited around the 35-40% mark."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In virtual grief work, a 'Safety Check' is mandatory to ensure the participant hasn't become dissociated or experienced a medical/emotional emergency while off-camera."
