            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Group supervision and reflecting teams allow for 'polyphonic' feedback, where multiple professional lenses help the specialist see blind spots they might miss in one-on-one supervision."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first step in S.O.L.A.C.E. is Support. For Secondary Traumatic Stress, the supervisor must first provide a safe, non-judgmental environment to address the specialist's well-being before moving to evaluation."
