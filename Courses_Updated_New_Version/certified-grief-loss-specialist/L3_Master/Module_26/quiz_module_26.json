            "options": [
                "To facilitate deep emotional catharsis through trauma processing",
                "To establish clear boundaries, predictability, and psychological containment",
                "To create legacy projects like memory boxes or letters",
                "To evaluate the program's return on investment for corporate stakeholders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Structure & Safety' phase is the foundation of the S.O.L.A.C.E. framework, focusing on creating a predictable environment that allows the nervous system to down-regulate before deeper work begins."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Industry data, specifically from the Grief Recovery Institute, suggests that the hidden costs of grief-related presenteeism exceed $75 billion annually in the United States due to lost productivity and errors."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

                "Closure focuses on the future; Legacy focuses on the past",
                "Closure seeks to end the relationship; Legacy seeks to transform the bond",
                "Closure is for traumatic loss; Legacy is for natural loss",
                "There is no distinction; they are clinical synonyms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Legacy integration is based on 'Continuing Bonds' theory, which encourages the bereaved to maintain a transformed, internal relationship with the deceased rather than seeking to 'close' or 'get over' the loss."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Peer leaders are at high risk for secondary trauma and boundary blurring because they share similar lived experiences with participants, making clinical supervision and clear role definitions vital."

            "options": [
                "Because clients are usually too bored to tell their story first",
                "To ensure the client has the neurological tools to stay within the 'Window of Tolerance'",
                "Because insurance companies require affect regulation as a primary code",
                "To prevent the Specialist from becoming bored with the narrative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traumatic loss can lead to hyper-arousal. Clients must learn to regulate their nervous systems (Affect Regulation) so they don't become re-traumatized when narrating the loss (Story Integration)."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Program fidelity ensures that the intervention is delivered as intended. This requires standardized manuals, specific facilitator training, and adherence to the core pillars of the evidence-based model."

                "A policy that prohibits the mention of the deceased to avoid 'triggering' others",

                "The expansion of a program into areas beyond the Specialist's training or the program's intent",
                "The slow process of building a community-led resilience model",
                "The time it takes for a client to move from the 'S' to the 'E' in S.O.L.A.C.E."
