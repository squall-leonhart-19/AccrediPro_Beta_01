            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While PTSD focuses on the 'threat' and the traumatic event, PGD is specifically characterized by an intense yearning for the person who died and a preoccupation with the loss itself."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a person's loss cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially supported, often due to the nature of the relationship or the cause of death."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dementia is a classic example of 'psychological absence with physical presence,' where the person is still physically there but their personality and memory are gone."

                "It speeds up the grieving process for the most vocal family member"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triangulation occurs when one family member tries to pull the specialist into a conflict against another member; maintaining neutrality is essential for effective intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Moral injury is based on fear, while PTSD is based on guilt",
                "Moral injury focuses on the betrayal of deeply held moral beliefs, while PTSD focuses on threats to safety",
                "PTSD requires a physical injury, whereas moral injury does not",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While PTSD is a startle/fear-based response to trauma, Moral Injury is a 'soul wound' resulting from actions (or inactions) that violate one's core ethical or moral code."

                "Encouraging the client to 'move on' and accept the death immediately",
                "Holding a 'mock funeral' without the body to provide closure",
                "Building 'Dialectical Thinking' to hold the possibility of both life and death simultaneously",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In ambiguous loss, 'closure' is often impossible. Specialists help clients build the capacity for dialectical thinking—accepting that the person is both 'gone' and 'not gone'."
