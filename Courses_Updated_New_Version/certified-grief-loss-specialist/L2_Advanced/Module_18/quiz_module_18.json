            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of integrated grief, which brain region is primarily responsible for the 'top-down' regulation of the amygdala, allowing the bereaved to recall the deceased without triggering a full fight-or-flight response?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)",
                "The Nucleus Accumbens",
                "The Periaqueductal Gray",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The vmPFC is critical for emotional regulation and 'extinction learning' in grief, helping to modulate the amygdala's acute stress response as grief becomes integrated."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Self-continuity is the psychological thread that connects who the person was before the loss to who they are now, preventing identity fragmentation."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PTG does not mean the end of sadness or grief; rather, it is the co-existence of growth and the reality of the loss. The five domains are: Personal Strength, New Possibilities, Improved Relationships, Spiritual Change, and Appreciation of Life."

            "question": "Clinical Mastery in the Holistic S.O.L.A.C.E. Synthesis requires the practitioner to move from 'Intervention' to 'Witnessing.' What does this mean?",
