            "question": "According to the DSM-5-TR and Lesson 3, what is the minimum duration of symptoms required to diagnose an adult with Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD)?",
            "options": [
                "3 months post-loss",
                "6 months post-loss",
                "12 months post-loss",
                "24 months post-loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the ICD-11 uses a 6-month threshold, the DSM-5-TR requires that the death occurred at least 12 months ago for adults (6 months for children/adolescents) to meet PGD criteria."

        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In the Observational Awareness Matrix, which physiological marker is most indicative of a client moving into a 'hypo-aroused' or 'dorsal vagal' state during assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, shallow thoracic breathing",
                "Increased muscle tension in the jaw and shoulders",
                "Fixed, glazed gaze and slumped posture",
                "Restless movement of the hands and feet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by a 'shut down' response, often manifesting as a glazed gaze, reduced muscle tone, and a feeling of numbness or disconnection."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "The PG-13-R (Prolonged Grief Disorder - 13 - Revised) is the gold standard for screening. Which score is generally used as the clinical 'cutoff' indicating a high risk for PGD?",
            "options": [
                "A score of 15 or higher",
                "A score of 20 or higher",

                "A score of 45 or higher"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a score of 30 or higher on the PG-13-R, combined with meeting the frequency criteria for core symptoms, suggests a high likelihood of PGD."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which assessment tool is specifically used in Lesson 5 to measure 'Meaning-Making' and the degree to which a loss has been integrated into the survivor's life narrative?",
            "options": [
                "The Integration of Stressful Life Experiences Scale (ISLES)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The ISLES is a validated metric used to assess how well an individual has integrated a stressful life event, such as a death, into their global meaning system."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "When assessing 'Affective Processing' (Lesson 4), a client expresses intense belief that they could have prevented the death despite evidence to the contrary. This is a metric for which specific construct?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hindsight bias involves the 'knew-it-all-along' effect, where the survivor overestimates their ability to have predicted or prevented the outcome, leading to pathological guilt."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) measures five specific domains. Which of the following is NOT one of the domains measured by this tool?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The five domains of the PTGI are: New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Personal Strength, Spiritual Change, and Appreciation of Life. Financial restoration is not a metric of PTG."

            "options": [
                "To track the genetic history of mental illness in the family",
                "To visualize the strength and quality of the client's external support systems",
                "To determine the financial cost of the funeral and legal proceedings",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Eco-Map helps the specialist and client visualize the flow of energy and support between the individual and their social environment, identifying areas of isolation or conflict."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client presents with high 'Personal Strength' scores on the PTGI but very low 'Integration' scores on the ISLES. What does this data synthesis suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The client is experiencing 'illusory growth' and is likely in deep denial",
                "The client has developed resilience but has not yet found a way to make sense of the loss",
                "The client is fully recovered and no longer needs intervention",
                "The client is at high risk for immediate self-harm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It is common for survivors to feel personally stronger (resilience) while still struggling to find meaning in the event itself (low integration). This indicates a need for narrative work."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Based on the statistics provided in Lesson 6, what percentage of individuals typically report experiencing at least some level of Post-Traumatic Growth following a significant loss?",

                "Less than 10%",
                "Approximately 25%",
