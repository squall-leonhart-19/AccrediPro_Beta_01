            "question": "In neurobiological studies of bereavement using fMRI, which brain region is most frequently associated with the 'social pain' of loss, showing activation patterns similar to physical pain?",
            "options": [
                "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)",
                "The Occipital Lobe",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research by Gundel et al. (2003) and others demonstrates that the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is activated during grief-related stimuli, processing the 'hurt' of social rejection or loss similarly to physical pain."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "According to attachment theory research, which attachment style is the strongest predictor for developing Chronic Grief (prolonged high distress)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal studies show that individuals with Anxious-Ambivalent attachment styles are most susceptible to Chronic Grief due to high levels of dependency and anxiety regarding separation."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Robert Neimeyer’s research on 'Meaning-Making' suggests that the inability to find sense in a loss is a significant predictor of Complicated Grief. What did his 2010 study identify as the primary mediator?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neimeyer's research found that 'sense-making' (finding meaning) was the most significant mediator between the loss and the severity of grief symptoms, outweighing demographic variables."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have consistently shown that the stress of acute grief suppresses Natural Killer (NK) cell activity, which reduces the body's ability to fight off viral infections and malignant cells."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Common Factors' model identifies that approximately 30% of the variance in therapeutic outcomes is due to the quality of the therapeutic alliance, regardless of the specific modality used."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "In the study of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG), Tedeschi and Calhoun identified five specific domains of growth. Which of the following is NOT one of those domains?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bonanno's research across multiple studies found that roughly 35% to 55% of bereaved individuals exhibit a 'Resilience' trajectory, characterized by relatively low and stable levels of disruption."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The research indicates that 'blanket' grief counseling for everyone has low efficacy, but targeted interventions for those with high levels of distress or Complicated Grief show significant positive effects."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A client presents with significant memory lapses and difficulty concentrating three months after a loss. Research into the neurobiology of grief suggests this is likely due to the impact of chronic cortisol on which brain structure?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Hippocampus is highly sensitive to glucocorticoids (cortisol). Chronic stress during bereavement can lead to hippocampal volume reduction or functional impairment, resulting in memory and concentration issues."
