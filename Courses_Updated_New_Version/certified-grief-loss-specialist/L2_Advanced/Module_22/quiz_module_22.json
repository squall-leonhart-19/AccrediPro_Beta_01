            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While grief specialists handle intense emotions, active suicidality and clinical disorders like PCBD or MDD fall outside the L2 scope and require clinical intervention."

                "Because practitioner burnout and 'compassion fatigue' lead to impaired judgment and potential harm to vulnerable clients.",
                "Because insurance companies require 10 hours of self-care per month.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-care is an ethical obligation because an 'impaired' practitioner cannot provide competent care, potentially violating the core principle of non-maleficence (do no harm)."
