            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "In the S.O.L.A.C.E. Method™ framework, what is the primary objective of the 'Safe Space' (S) phase before moving to 'Observational Awareness'?",
            "options": [
                "To achieve immediate closure for the client's trauma.",
                "To facilitate neurobiological downregulation and move the client out of a sympathetic 'fight-or-flight' state.",
                "To begin the process of legacy integration and meaning-making.",
                "To challenge the client's cognitive distortions regarding the loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' phase focuses on the neurobiology of trust, specifically activating the ventral vagal system to reduce cortisol and increase oxytocin, allowing the client to feel safe enough for deeper work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on 'Observational Awareness' (O), which of the following is a key somatic marker of 'Incongruent Grief'?",
            "options": [
                "The client uses a 'monotone' voice while describing highly emotional memories.",
                "The client exhibits a relaxed posture while crying.",
                "The client maintains consistent eye contact during the entire session.",
                "The client reports feeling 'light' and 'airy' after a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Incongruence often manifests as a 'flat affect' or monotone voice (prosody) that does not match the emotional weight of the content, signaling a potential dissociation or emotional constriction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "The 'Legacy Integration' (L) phase is heavily influenced by the 'Continuing Bonds' theory. What does this theory suggest is the goal of grief work?",
            "options": [
                "Severing all emotional ties with the deceased to move forward.",
                "Reaching a state of 'closure' where the deceased is rarely thought of.",
                "Transforming the relationship with the deceased from presence to a different, internalised form.",
                "Focusing exclusively on the future without looking back at the past."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Legacy Integration moves away from the outdated concept of 'letting go' and instead focuses on how the client can maintain a healthy, internalised connection with the deceased."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "During 'Affective Processing' (A), the specialist uses 'Titration.' What does this technique involve?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to experience all their grief at once to 'get it over with.'",
                "Introducing small, manageable 'doses' of the traumatic or painful material to prevent overwhelming the nervous system.",
                "A pharmacological approach to managing grief-related anxiety.",
                "Using logic to suppress the client's emotional responses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the emotional experience, allowing the client to process grief in small 'bites' so they remain within their 'Window of Tolerance.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "In the 'Compassionate Rebuilding' (C) phase, what is the primary focus for the client?",
            "options": [
                "Returning exactly to the life they had before the loss occurred.",
                "Forgiving the person or entity responsible for the loss.",
                "Constructing a 'new normal' that integrates the reality of the loss into a functional future.",
                "Focusing on physical fitness and dietary changes as a distraction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compassionate Rebuilding is about narrative reconstruction—helping the client build a life that acknowledges the loss but is not entirely consumed by it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which indicator best demonstrates that a client has achieved 'Empowered Resilience' (E)?",
            "options": [
                "The client no longer feels any sadness on the anniversary of the loss.",
                "The client has developed self-regulation tools to navigate 'grief bursts' independently.",
                "The client has stopped attending all forms of therapy or support groups.",
                "The client avoids talking about the loss to prevent emotional upset."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowered Resilience is defined by the client's ability to use the tools they've learned to manage their own emotional states and sustain long-term stability."

            "id": "q8_7",

            "options": [
                "Telling the client that 'everything happens for a reason.'",
                "Suggesting a 'Living Legacy' project, such as a scholarship or a community garden in the deceased's name.",
                "Moving back to the 'Safe Space' phase and staying there indefinitely.",
                "Advising the client to stop thinking about the deceased for two weeks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Living Legacy projects are a core part of the 'L' phase, helping clients externalise their internal meaning-making into tangible, positive actions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Safe Space), the 'Polyvagal Theory' is discussed. Which state must a client be in to engage in 'Social Engagement' and effective processing?",
            "options": [
                "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown/Collapse)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)",
                "Ventral Vagal (Safety/Connection)",
                "Hyper-arousal (Panic)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' system. Only when this system is active can a client truly engage in the cognitive and emotional work of the S.O.L.A.C.E. Method."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "When synthesizing the S.O.L.A.C.E. Method in Case Management (L8), what should a specialist do if a client experiences a significant 'relapse' into acute distress during the 'Rebuilding' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Terminate the sessions as the framework is clearly not working.",
                "Push through to the 'Resilience' phase to force progress.",
                "Loop back to the 'Safe Space' and 'Affective Processing' phases to stabilize the client.",
                "Ignore the distress and focus only on future goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The S.O.L.A.C.E. Method is iterative, not strictly linear. Case management requires the flexibility to return to earlier phases like 'Safe Space' if the client becomes destabilized."

        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that structured meaning-making frameworks like S.O.L.A.C.E. can reduce symptoms of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) by what percentage compared to non-structured support?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Approximately 40%",
                "Approximately 65%",
                "Approximately 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that structured, phase-based interventions (like S.O.L.A.C.E.) typically show a 40% greater efficacy in reducing PGD symptoms than unstructured 'talk therapy' or general support groups."
