            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for the 'emotional hijacking' often seen in acute grief, leading to a diminished capacity for rational thought?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala acts as the brain's alarm system. During acute grief, it can become hyper-activated, triggering a 'fight-flight-freeze' response that bypasses the rational Prefrontal Cortex."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the nervous system's way of scanning the environment for cues of safety or danger without involving conscious thought."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "During a session, a client begins to breathe shallowly and avoids eye contact while discussing their loss. Which somatic state does this most likely indicate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Shallow breathing and increased movement (restlessness) or avoidance are classic signs of sympathetic nervous system activation, indicating the client is moving into a state of hyper-arousal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guilt often acts as a defense mechanism; if a person feels guilty, it implies they had the power to change the outcome, which is often more comforting than accepting total powerlessness."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up tools address the nervous system directly. Extended exhalations stimulate the Vagus nerve, helping to shift the client from a stressed state to a calmer one."
