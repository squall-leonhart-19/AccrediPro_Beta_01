            "question": "In the SOLACE Method™, what is the primary objective of the 'O' (Observational Awareness) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To provide immediate solutions to the client's problems",
                "To identify somatic, cognitive, and emotional markers without premature interpretation",
                "To correct the client's irrational thoughts using cognitive behavioral techniques",
                "To document the client's history for insurance purposes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Observational Awareness is about 'witnessing' the client's state—identifying somatic, cognitive, and emotional markers—before moving into validation or intervention."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory as applied in Lesson 2, which state must the specialist's own nervous system be in to facilitate 'Safe Space' establishment?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic activation (High energy)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown/Stillness)",
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement System)",
                "Functional Freeze (Productive but detached)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' state. Through co-regulation, the specialist's calm nervous system helps anchor the client's dysregulated system."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the course indicates that approximately what percentage of grieving individuals report 'somatic heaviness' or 'extreme fatigue' as their primary physical symptom in the first 3 months?",
            "options": [
                "15-20%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Grief Body' study highlights that somatic markers like extreme fatigue and heaviness are reported by 65-70% of clients, making somatic observation a critical first step."

            "options": [
                "Validation is for emotions; Normalization is for physical symptoms",
                "Validation acknowledges the individual's unique truth; Normalization places that truth within the context of common human experience",
                "Validation is used for 'healthy' grief; Normalization is used for 'complicated' grief",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in the SOLACE Method™"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validation honors the 'I feel this' (personal), while Normalization honors the 'It is okay/common to feel this' (universal)."

            "question": "During a session, a client expresses: 'I feel like I'm losing my mind because I keep smelling my late wife's perfume in the hallway.' Which response best demonstrates 'Relational Anchoring'?",

                "'I hear you, and I want you to know that olfactory triggers are a very common way the brain processes loss. You are safe here.'",
                "'You should probably see a neurologist to rule out any brain abnormalities.'",
                "'Let's try to ignore that and focus on your goals for next week.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relational Anchoring combines validation with the assurance of safety, grounding the client's confusing experience in the specialist's expertise and presence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Counterfactual thinking involves mentally 'undoing' the past with 'if only' statements, which is a common cognitive map in acute grief."

                "A client crying uncontrollably for 20 minutes during a session",
                "A client expressing deep sadness and a lack of motivation to return to work",
                "A client exhibiting 'Active Suicidal Ideation' with a specific plan and intent",
                "A client who is angry at God or their spiritual community"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While grief specialists handle deep sadness and anger, 'Active Suicidal Ideation' is outside the coaching scope and requires immediate clinical intervention."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In Case Conceptualization (Lesson 8), why is 'S' (Safe Space) established before 'O' (Observational Awareness)?",
            "options": [
                "Because the specialist needs time to get their notes ready",
                "Because a dysregulated client (in Fight/Flight/Freeze) cannot accurately access or report their internal state",
                "Because Safe Space is the only billable part of the process",
                "It is a trick question; Observation should always happen before the client feels safe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is the biological prerequisite for reflection. If the client is not in a Ventral Vagal state, their 'observations' will be skewed by survival instincts."

                "The physical pain felt in the heart during grief"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is an involuntary, subconscious process where the nervous system scans for cues of safety (like a warm tone of voice) or danger."

            "explanation": "Physical manifestations like jaw tension and breathing patterns are Somatic Markers—the body's way of 'holding' the tension of loss."
