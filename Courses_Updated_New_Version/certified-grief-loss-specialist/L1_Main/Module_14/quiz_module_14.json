                "Immediate termination of the session to prevent re-traumatization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation involves the rhythmic shifting between a point of 'resource' (safety) and the 'activation' (trauma) to help the nervous system integrate the experience without becoming overwhelmed."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-chest breathing and throat constriction are hallmark somatic markers of sympathetic nervous system activation, indicating the client is moving into a 'hyper-aroused' state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
