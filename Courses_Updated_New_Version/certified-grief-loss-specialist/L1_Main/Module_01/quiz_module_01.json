            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory discussed in Lesson 1, which physiological state must the specialist embody to facilitate a client's transition out of 'fight-or-flight'?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal state (immobilization)",
                "The Ventral Vagal state (social engagement)",
                "The Sympathetic state (mobilization)",
                "The Amygdala Hijack state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'social engagement system' characterized by safety and connection. By co-regulating from this state, the specialist helps the client's nervous system shift away from defensive responses."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "When designing a virtual 'holding space,' which factor is most critical for maintaining the 'Digital Containment' required for deep emotional processing?",

                "Maintaining consistent eye contact by looking at the camera lens, not the screen",
                "Using a virtual background of a busy office to show professionalism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digital containment relies on perceived presence; looking directly at the camera lens simulates eye contact, which is a key neurobiological cue for safety and attunement."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A specialist is working with a client who asks, 'Have you ever lost someone close to you?' According to the ethics of 'The Contract of Compassion,' what is the most appropriate response?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Limited, purposeful self-disclosure can humanize the specialist, but it must be brief and always serve the client's therapeutic goals rather than the specialist's need for expression."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Third Chair represents the specialist's ability to maintain a 'meta-perspective,' observing the dynamics of the room without becoming reactive or judgmental."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility is a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and power-balancing, focusing on the specialist's willingness to learn from the client rather than claiming mastery over their culture."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioception involves the sense of self-movement and body position. Physical resistance or pressure (like pushing against a wall) provides strong feedback to the brain about where the body ends and the world begins."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Defining the Scope of Practice is an ethical necessity that ensures clients receive appropriate care and that the specialist does not attempt interventions (like clinical trauma therapy) for which they are not licensed."
