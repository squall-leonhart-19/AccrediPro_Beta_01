            "question": "In the context of 'Somatic Markers of Grief' (Lesson 1), which physiological observation is most indicative of a client entering a state of sympathetic nervous system hyper-arousal?",
            "options": [
                "Deep, rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing",
                "Shallow thoracic breathing and jaw clenching",
                "Slumped posture and slowed speech",
                "Increased lacrimation (tearing) and relaxed shoulders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shallow thoracic breathing and jaw clenching are classic somatic markers of the 'fight or flight' response (hyper-arousal) often triggered by acute grief processing."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "Narrative Reconstruction (Lesson 2) focuses on 're-authoring' the loss. What is the primary objective of this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client forget the traumatic details of the event",
                "To convince the client that the loss was a positive occurrence",
                "To integrate the loss into a coherent and meaningful life story",
                "To ensure the client stops talking about the deceased"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative reconstruction aims to help the bereaved make sense of the loss by incorporating it into their larger life narrative, moving from a fragmented story to a coherent one."

            "options": [
                "A loss that is clearly defined by a death certificate",
                "Loss that occurs without closure or clear understanding, such as a missing person or dementia",
                "The loss of a pet that the family didn't like",
                "A financial loss that can be recovered through insurance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ambiguous loss is characterized by a lack of clarity and closure, where the person is either physically absent but psychologically present (missing person) or physically present but psychologically absent (dementia)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stabilization is the first step in the S.O.L.A.C.E. method, focusing on ensuring the client's immediate safety and emotional regulation before proceeding to deeper processing."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Grief Storms' involving guilt and regret. What is the key distinction between 'Productive Regret' and 'Unproductive Guilt'?",
            "options": [
                "Productive regret leads to self-punishment; unproductive guilt leads to change",
                "Productive regret leads to learning and behavioral change; unproductive guilt leads to a cycle of self-loathing",
                "There is no difference; both are harmful to the grieving process",
                "Unproductive guilt is based on facts; productive regret is based on imagination"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Productive regret allows a client to acknowledge a mistake and use it for future growth, whereas unproductive guilt often involves 'should-have' thinking that traps the client in shame."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "When establishing 'Safe Spaces' (Lesson 5), why is 'Cultural Humility' preferred over 'Cultural Competence'?",
            "options": [
                "It requires less study and effort from the specialist",
                "It assumes the specialist already knows everything about the client's culture",
                "It emphasizes a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and acknowledging power imbalances",
                "It focuses only on the specialist's own cultural background"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility is a dynamic process of self-reflection and learning that acknowledges the specialist can never be a total 'expert' on another person's unique cultural experience."

                "Has a very complicated and difficult personality",
                "Maintains multiple, distinct roles and identities (e.g., friend, artist, professional) to buffer against the loss of one role",
                "Refuses to accept any new roles after a loss",
                "Experiences multiple personality fragments due to trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Higher self-complexity—having various roles and self-aspects—provides 'buffers' so that when one part of the identity is damaged by loss, other parts remain intact to support resilience."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Lesson 7 emphasizes 'Empowered Resilience.' Which strategy is most effective for the long-term maintenance of coping tools?",

                "Avoiding all places or people that remind the client of the loss",
                "Ending all support immediately once the client feels 'better'",
                "Proactive application of tools during low-stress times to build 'muscle memory'",
                "Relying on the specialist to tell the client what to do in every situation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Building resilience requires practicing coping tools during non-crisis times so they become accessible and automatic when a 'grief storm' or stressor occurs."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Within the S.O.L.A.C.E. method (Lesson 8), the 'E' stands for 'Empowerment.' How is this achieved in a crisis intervention setting?",
            "options": [
                "By giving the client a list of instructions to follow exactly",
                "By helping the client identify their own immediate resources and small, manageable next steps",
                "By taking over all decision-making for the client",
                "By promising the client that everything will return to exactly how it was"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowerment in crisis intervention involves restoring a sense of agency to the client by helping them recognize their strengths and take small, autonomous actions."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Moral Injury' (Lesson 4) after the death of a parent they were estranged from. They feel intense regret over things left unsaid. Which intervention is most appropriate?",

                "Telling the client it doesn't matter because the parent is gone",
                "Using the 'Empty Chair' technique or 'Unsent Letter' to facilitate affective processing",
                "Encouraging the client to ignore the feelings and move on",
                "Focusing only on the positive memories of the parent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Facilitated affective processing through techniques like the unsent letter allows the client to express 'unfinished business' and address the moral/ethical weight of the estrangement."
