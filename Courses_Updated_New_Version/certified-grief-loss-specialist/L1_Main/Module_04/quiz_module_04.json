            "question": "In the SOLACE Method™, what is the primary objective of the 'Affective Processing' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress negative emotions so the client can focus on logic",
                "To move from 'thinking about' grief to 'experiencing and integrating' the emotional weight of the loss",
                "To provide a clinical diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder",
                "To complete all administrative tasks related to the deceased's estate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Affective processing focuses on the 'A' in SOLACE, moving the client from cognitive avoidance or intellectualization into the safe, somatic, and emotional integration of the loss."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Neurobiologically, 'Grief Brain' is often characterized by an overactive amygdala and a 'downregulated' version of which brain region?",
            "options": [
                "Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)",
                "Occipital Lobe",
                "Cerebellum",
                "Basal Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Prefrontal Cortex, responsible for executive function and emotional regulation, often becomes 'offline' or downregulated during intense grief, leading to the 'brain fog' and impulsivity associated with the amygdala's fight-or-flight response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client states, 'I am a terrible person because I wasn't there when they died.' According to Lesson 3, this statement is an example of:",

                "Shame",

                "Restoration Orientation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While guilt focuses on a specific behavior ('I did something bad'), shame is an attack on the self ('I am bad'). The statement 'I am a terrible person' reflects the global self-condemnation characteristic of shame."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In the context of processing anger and 'Why' questions, what is the 'Counterfactual Thinking' often seen in grieving clients?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to calculate the financial cost of a funeral",
                "The mental habit of creating 'if only' scenarios to try and reverse the outcome",
                "A refusal to acknowledge that the death occurred",
                "A cognitive technique used to increase happiness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counterfactual thinking involves the 'if only' or 'what if' loops where the brain attempts to find a different outcome to a past event, which often fuels guilt and prevents the processing of the reality of the loss."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 5), which state is a client likely in if they appear 'numb,' disconnected, and have a low heart rate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the evolutionary 'freeze' response, characterized by numbness, dissociation, and a feeling of being 'paralyzed' by the weight of sorrow."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which cognitive distortion involves taking a single negative event and seeing it as a never-ending pattern of defeat (e.g., 'Nothing will ever go right again')?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Overgeneralization takes one specific instance of loss or pain and projects it onto all future events, creating a sense of hopelessness."

                "The mood swings associated with bipolar disorder",
                "The rapid movement between different stages of the Kübler-Ross model",
                "The healthy back-and-forth movement between loss-oriented and restoration-oriented stressors",
                "The physical shaking sometimes seen during somatic release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oscillation is the regulatory process of moving between facing the grief (loss-orientation) and taking a 'dosage' break to handle life's demands (restoration-orientation)."

                "Comparing the client's grief to other clients to provide perspective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration ensures the client is not overwhelmed by the 'flood' of emotion. It allows them to experience a small amount of the affect, process it, and return to a state of safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Restoration-oriented tasks involve the secondary stressors of loss, such as mastering new skills, adjusting to a new identity, or managing practical life changes resulting from the death."
