            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Niche mastery involves moving away from generalism toward a 'Blue Ocean' where you solve a specific, high-stakes problem for a defined demographic, reducing competition and increasing perceived value."

            "question": "In the context of 'Legal Frameworks and Scope of Practice' (Lesson 2), which statement is legally permissible for a non-licensed Holistic Nutrition Specialist to use in a client protocol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nutrition specialists must use educational and supportive language rather than diagnostic or prescriptive language. Terms like 'supporting healthy levels' are educational, whereas 'cure,' 'treat,' or 'prescribe' are restricted to licensed medical professionals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-ticket programs succeed by decoupling time from money. Clients pay for the transformation and the end result, not the number of hours or sessions the practitioner spends with them."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digital programs are highly scalable because once the content is created, the cost of adding one additional user is near zero, unlike 1-on-1 or group coaching which still requires practitioner time."
