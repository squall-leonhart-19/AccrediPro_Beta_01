            "question": "A practitioner chooses to move away from 'General Nutrition' to 'Nutrigenomic Optimization for Executive Burnout.' According to Lesson 1, what is the primary strategic advantage of this 'Category of One' positioning?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for lower pricing to attract a higher volume of clients",
                "It eliminates direct competition by solving a specific, high-stakes problem",
                "It reduces the need for any formal certification or licensing",
                "It focuses primarily on the practitioner's personal story rather than client results"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic brand positioning (Lesson 1) focuses on 'narrowing the niche' to solve a high-stakes problem, which effectively eliminates direct competition and allows for premium pricing."

            "question": "According to the Authority-Based Content Strategy (Lesson 2), what distinguishes 'Thought Leadership' content from standard 'Educational' content?",
            "options": [
                "Educational content is longer, while Thought Leadership is always short-form",
                "Thought Leadership provides a unique perspective or 'contrarian' view on industry norms",
                "Educational content is only shared on social media, never in emails",
                "Thought Leadership content avoids using scientific references to remain accessible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thought leadership involves providing a unique 'POV' (Point of View) or challenging the status quo, whereas educational content typically focuses on explaining established facts."

                "Application Funnel: VSL (Video Sales Letter) → Application → Discovery Call",
                "Low-ticket 'Tripwire' funnel leading to a $27 ebook"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket programs ($3k+) require a high-touch enrollment process. The Application Funnel filters out unqualified leads and sets the stage for a consultative enrollment call."

                "Asking for referrals at every single networking event",
                "Focusing exclusively on digital partnerships rather than local ones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Medical professionals value clinical outcomes and communication. Closing the feedback loop with progress reports builds trust and ensures the partnership is viewed as a collaborative care model."

            "question": "When scaling with Paid Acquisition (Lesson 5), why is a 1:1 ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) on the front-end often considered a 'win' for high-ticket practices?",
            "options": [
                "Because it means the practitioner is losing money and can claim a tax deduction",
                "Because it acquires a customer for free, allowing for 100% profit on backend upsells and LTV",
                "Because high-ticket programs do not require profit to be sustainable",
                "Because Facebook and Google algorithms require a 1:1 ratio to keep ad costs low"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Lesson 5, 'liquidating' ad spend on the front end (breaking even) allows a business to scale aggressively because the profit is generated through the Lifetime Value (LTV) and long-term retention."

                "To explain the technical gaps in the client's current supplement regimen",
                "To highlight the practitioner's educational background and credentials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Gap' is the emotional and logical distance between where the client is now (pain) and where they want to be (goal). The practitioner's program is presented as the bridge to cross that gap."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nutritionists must use 'Structure/Function' claims (e.g., 'supports,' 'maintains') rather than 'Disease' claims (e.g., 'cure,' 'treat,' 'reverse') to remain compliant with regulatory bodies."

        {
            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "When scaling to Group Programs (Lesson 8), what is the 'Hybrid Model' of delivery?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hybrid Model allows practitioners to scale by using digital assets (pre-recorded content) for education while maintaining high-value live group or individual touchpoints for implementation."

            "question": "A practitioner notices their 'Discovery Call' conversion rate is below 20%. Based on Lesson 6, what is the most likely tactical error being made?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner is spending too much time listening to the client's history",
                "The practitioner is 'coaching' the client on the call instead of 'enrolling' them",
                "The price of the program is mentioned within the first 5 minutes of the call",
                "The practitioner is using a Zoom link instead of a phone call"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A common mistake in enrollment calls is 'over-coaching.' If the client receives the 'how-to' during the call, they may feel they have the solution and see no need to invest in the full program."

            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "Which metric is most critical when determining the 'Scalability' of a paid advertising campaign for a holistic practice?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scalability is determined by the relationship between CAC and LTV. If the cost to acquire a customer is significantly lower than the profit generated by that customer, the campaign can be scaled."
