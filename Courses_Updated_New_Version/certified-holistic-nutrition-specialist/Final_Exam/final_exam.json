            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "Under the 'N' (Nutritional Assessment) phase of the NOURISH Method™, which combination of biomarkers is most indicative of early-stage metabolic syndrome requiring immediate dietary intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Fasting glucose >100 mg/dL, Triglycerides >150 mg/dL, and HDL <40 mg/dL (men) or <50 mg/dL (women)",
                "Total cholesterol >200 mg/dL, LDL >130 mg/dL, and Vitamin D <30 ng/mL",
                "HbA1c of 5.2%, CRP <1.0 mg/L, and Ferritin >100 ng/mL",
                "Blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, BMI of 22, and Fasting Insulin of 4 uIU/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic syndrome is clinically defined by a cluster of conditions including elevated fasting glucose, high triglycerides, and low HDL, which serve as primary baseline markers in the 'N' phase."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PPI use reduces stomach acid, which is necessary for protein breakdown (proteolysis) and triggers the MMC; impairment here often leads to SIBO and delayed clearing of the small intestine."
