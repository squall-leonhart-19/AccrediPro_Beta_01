            "question": "Which of the following best defines 'Metabolic Flexibility' as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "The capacity to switch efficiently between oxidizing glucose and oxidizing fatty acids based on availability and demand.",
                "The ability of the body to maintain a steady blood glucose level of 90 mg/dL regardless of carbohydrate intake.",
                "The process of converting excess dietary protein into glucose via gluconeogenesis during periods of fasting.",
                "The speed at which the thyroid gland adjusts the basal metabolic rate in response to environmental temperature changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is the physiological ability to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability, allowing the body to burn fat during rest or low-intensity activity and switch to glucose for high-intensity demands."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A client presents with an HbA1c of 6.1%. According to the blood sugar dynamics discussed in Lesson 2, how would this be categorized?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal metabolic health",
                "Pre-diabetes range",
                "Type 2 Diabetes",
                "Hypoglycemic risk"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An HbA1c range of 5.7% to 6.4% is clinically recognized as the pre-diabetes range, indicating a need for immediate intervention in glycemic control and insulin sensitivity."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Which nutrient is a critical cofactor for the 5'-deiodinase enzyme responsible for converting T4 (thyroxine) into the active T3 (triiodothyronine) in peripheral tissues?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Vitamin K2",
                "Selenium",
                "Manganese"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is essential for the function of deiodinase enzymes; a deficiency can impair the conversion of T4 to the metabolically active T3, even if the thyroid gland is producing enough T4."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Endocrine Disruptors' like phthalates were discussed. Where are these chemicals most commonly found in a client's daily environment?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are widely used as plasticizers and 'fragrance fixatives' in shampoos, lotions, and soft plastics, and are known to interfere with androgen and estrogen signaling."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "According to Chronobiology (Lesson 5), what is the primary 'zeitgeber' (time-giver) that resets the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) every morning?",
            "options": [
                "The consumption of a high-protein breakfast",
                "Exposure of the retina to high-intensity blue light (sunlight)",

                "The drop in core body temperature that occurs during REM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Light is the primary zeitgeber; morning sunlight exposure inhibits melatonin production and signals the SCN to synchronize the body's peripheral clocks for the day."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Chronic activation of the HPA axis leads to the depletion of which specific 'anti-stress' mineral, often resulting in muscle tension and poor sleep?",
            "options": [
                "Iron",
                "Copper",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Stress triggers the excretion of magnesium through the kidneys. Because magnesium is required to regulate the stress response, this creates a 'vicious cycle' of depletion and increased stress sensitivity."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Which hormone, produced by adipose tissue, is responsible for signaling long-term energy sufficiency to the hypothalamus to suppress appetite?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin is the 'satiety hormone' that informs the brain of energy stores; leptin resistance is a common hallmark of metabolic dysfunction where the brain no longer 'hears' the signal to stop eating."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that even a single night of partial sleep deprivation (4 hours) can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by up to 25%, significantly impacting glucose metabolism the following day."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in NOURISH stands for Restorative Sleep and Resilience, emphasizing that metabolic health cannot be achieved through diet alone without addressing the nervous system and recovery."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which practical strategy is most effective for improving postprandial (after-meal) glucose clearance without increasing insulin secretion?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Light physical activity after a meal stimulates GLUT4 translocation in muscle cells, allowing glucose to be cleared from the bloodstream independently of insulin."
