            "question": "In the TAO (Thyroid-Adrenal-Ovarian) Axis, how does chronic elevated cortisol specifically impact thyroid hormone metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) from the pituitary.",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, decreasing the conversion of T4 to active T3.",
                "It stimulates the thyroid gland to produce excessive amounts of T4.",
                "It decreases the production of Reverse T3 (rT3), leading to hyperthyroidism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting the pro-hormone T4 into the metabolically active T3, often leading to increased Reverse T3 (rT3) instead."

            "question": "During Phase II Liver Biotransformation, which conjugation pathway is primarily responsible for the detoxification of acetaminophen and steroid hormones?",
            "options": [
                "Acetylation",
                "Methylation",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Sulfation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation is the most common Phase II pathway, responsible for conjugating a wide range of compounds including acetaminophen, bilirubin, and various steroid hormones to make them water-soluble."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.72 during a fasted state. What does this value indicate regarding their metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily utilizing carbohydrates for fuel.",
                "The client is in a state of anaerobic glycolysis.",
                "The client is efficiently utilizing fatty acids for fuel.",
                "The client has poor metabolic flexibility and cannot switch to fat burning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.72 in a fasted state suggests excellent metabolic flexibility and efficient fat utilization."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which mechanism best describes how xenoestrogens like Bisphenol A (BPA) disrupt the endocrine system?",
            "options": [
                "They destroy the receptor sites on the cell membrane.",
                "They bind to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and mimic or block natural estrogen.",
                "They inhibit the liver's ability to produce cholesterol, the precursor to all hormones.",
                "They increase the half-life of insulin in the bloodstream."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA and other xenoestrogens act as endocrine disruptors by binding to estrogen receptors, where they can either trigger an inappropriate hormonal response or block natural estrogens from binding."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "In pediatric nutrition, why is 'Microbiome Seeding' considered critical during the first 1,000 days of life?",
            "options": [
                "Because the gut is sterile until age five.",
                "It determines the adult height and bone density of the child.",
                "It trains the innate and adaptive immune system, reducing the risk of atopy and autoimmune conditions.",
                "It prevents the child from developing any food allergies regardless of later diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first 1,000 days are a critical window where the developing microbiome 'educates' the immune system; disruptions during this time are linked to higher rates of asthma, allergies, and autoimmunity."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "To combat 'Anabolic Resistance' in geriatric clients, what is the recommended protein intake per meal to effectively stimulate muscle protein synthesis (mTOR)?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams",
                "20-25 grams",
                "35-40 grams",
                "60-70 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Older adults require a higher 'leucine threshold' to trigger muscle synthesis due to anabolic resistance. Research suggests 0.4-0.6g/kg per meal, or roughly 35-40g of high-quality protein, is needed for maximal stimulation."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Triad of Autoimmunity' model proposed by Dr. Alessio Fasano, which three factors must be present for an autoimmune disease to manifest?",
            "options": [
                "High sugar diet, sedentary lifestyle, and poor sleep.",
                "Genetic predisposition, an environmental trigger, and increased intestinal permeability.",
                "Vitamin D deficiency, viral load, and heavy metal toxicity.",
                "Antibiotic use, C-section birth, and lack of breastfeeding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Triad of Autoimmunity consists of: 1) Genetic susceptibility, 2) An environmental trigger (e.g., gluten or a virus), and 3) Intestinal permeability (leaky gut) allowing triggers to enter systemic circulation."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A client has a homozygous MTHFR C677T polymorphism. Which nutritional intervention is most appropriate based on this genetic insight?",
            "options": [
                "Supplementing with high doses of synthetic Folic Acid.",
                "Increasing intake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) and riboflavin.",
                "Restricting all B-vitamins to prevent over-methylation.",
                "Switching to a high-protein, zero-carbohydrate diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The C677T variant reduces the enzyme's ability to produce active folate. Using 5-MTHF (the active form) bypasses the enzyme defect, and Riboflavin (B2) is a necessary cofactor for the MTHFR enzyme."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "In 'Phase 2.5' detoxification (transport), which protein is responsible for pumping conjugated toxins out of the cell and into the bile or urine?",
            "options": [
                "Cytochrome P450",
                "Superoxide Dismutase",

                "Glutathione Peroxidase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III (sometimes called Phase 2.5) involves transport proteins like P-glycoprotein that move the water-soluble conjugates out of the cells for final excretion."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "What is the primary consequence of 'Pathological Detoxification,' where Phase I activity significantly outpaces Phase II activity?",
            "options": [
                "The body excretes toxins too quickly, leading to nutrient depletion.",
                "The liver stops producing bile, leading to fat malabsorption.",
                "Highly reactive intermediate metabolites accumulate, causing significant oxidative stress and tissue damage.",
                "The person becomes hyper-metabolic and loses weight too rapidly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase I creates reactive intermediates that are often more toxic than the original substance. If Phase II (conjugation) cannot keep up, these intermediates accumulate and cause cellular damage."
