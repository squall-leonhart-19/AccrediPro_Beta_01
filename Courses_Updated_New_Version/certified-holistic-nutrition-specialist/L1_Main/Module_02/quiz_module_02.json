            "question": "Which phase of digestion accounts for approximately 20-30% of total gastric acid secretion and is triggered solely by the sight, smell, or thought of food?",
            "options": [
                "The Cephalic Phase",
                "The Gastric Phase",

                "The Esophageal Phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Cephalic phase is the 'North' of the North-to-South process, where the vagus nerve stimulates gastric secretions before food reaches the stomach."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client presents with vertical ridges on their fingernails, low iron levels despite supplementation, and bloating 30 minutes after eating. Which condition should you first investigate?",

                "Fructose malabsorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria) impairs the ionization of minerals like iron and the breakdown of proteins, often manifesting as vertical nail ridges and early-onset post-prandial bloating."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological trigger for the release of Cholecystokinin (CCK), which then signals the gallbladder to contract?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of carbohydrates in the mouth",
                "The alkaline pH of the esophagus",

                "The stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CCK is secreted by the cells of the upper small intestine in response to fat and protein entering the duodenum, triggering bile release and pancreatic enzyme secretion."

                "Calprotectin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; high levels are a clinical marker for increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), specifically Butyrate, provide what percentage of the energy requirements for the epithelial cells (colonocytes) of the large intestine?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel source for colonocytes, providing about 60-70% of their total energy needs and supporting the integrity of the gut barrier."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "The 'Migrating Motor Complex' (MMC) is a wave of electromechanical activity that cleans the small intestine of undigested food and bacteria. During which state does the MMC primarily function?",
            "options": [
                "During the height of a meal",
                "The post-prandial (digestive) state",
                "The inter-digestive (fasting) state",
                "During intense physical exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MMC acts as the 'intestinal housekeeper' and only functions in the fasting state (between meals); frequent snacking can inhibit its ability to clear the small intestine."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A client's breath test shows a significant rise in Methane gas (CH4) early in the testing window. According to current clinical guidelines, this is most accurately classified as:",

                "Typical Dysbiosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because methanogens (Archaea) can overgrow in both the small and large intestines, the term Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO) is now preferred over 'Methane SIBO'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Replace' phase focuses on restoring digestive secretions (acid, enzymes, bile) that may be deficient, ensuring proper breakdown of nutrients."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vast majority of the body's serotonin (90-95%) is produced in the gut, where it regulates peristalsis and sensory signaling."
