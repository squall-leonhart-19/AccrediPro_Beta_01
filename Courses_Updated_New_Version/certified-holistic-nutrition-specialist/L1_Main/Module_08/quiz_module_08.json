            "question": "In the context of 'Holistic Vitality' as taught in Lesson 1, what is the primary distinction between symptom suppression and the vitalistic model?",
            "options": [
                "Symptom suppression focuses on immediate relief, while the vitalistic model views symptoms as valuable signals of underlying physiological imbalances.",
                "Symptom suppression uses only pharmaceutical drugs, while the vitalistic model uses only herbal remedies.",
                "The vitalistic model ignores symptoms entirely to focus on spiritual energy.",
                "Symptom suppression is only used for acute injuries, while the vitalistic model is for chronic illness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The vitalistic model treats symptoms as messengers or 'dashboard lights' that indicate a deeper root cause, whereas suppression focuses on silencing the symptom without addressing the origin."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that roughly 90-95% of the body's serotonin is found in the gut, highlighting the critical role of the gut-brain axis in mood regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt) occurs when the body diverts the precursor hormone pregnenolone toward cortisol production to manage stress, often at the expense of downstream hormones like progesterone and DHEA."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification involves conjugation, where the liver adds a substance (like glutathione or a methyl group) to a toxin to make it water-soluble so it can be safely excreted via bile or urine."

            "question": "A client presents with 'leaky gut,' high perceived stress, and brain fog. Using the concepts from Lessons 2 and 5, which sequence of events most likely explains their symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic stress → Elevated cortisol → Increased intestinal permeability → Systemic inflammation → Neuroinflammation",
                "High sugar intake → Insulin resistance → Liver failure → Brain fog",
                "Lack of exercise → Muscle atrophy → Decreased serotonin → Leaky gut",
                "Environmental toxins → Phase II detox failure → Low cortisol → Leaky gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "This represents the 'Gut-Brain-Immune' axis: stress triggers cortisol, which weakens the gut lining; a leaky gut allows endotoxins (LPS) into the blood, causing systemic inflammation that eventually crosses the blood-brain barrier."
