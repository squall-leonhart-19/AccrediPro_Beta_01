            "question": "In Advanced Biomarker Analysis, what is considered the 'optimal' functional range for High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) to indicate low systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "< 1.0 mg/L",
                "< 3.0 mg/L",
                "5.0 - 10.0 mg/L",
                "0.5 - 5.0 mg/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While standard labs may list < 3.0 mg/L as 'normal,' functional medicine and the CHS curriculum define optimal health and low cardiovascular risk as hs-CRP levels below 1.0 mg/L."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic bloating and brain fog. Laboratory testing shows elevated serum Zonulin levels. What does this biomarker specifically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria)",
                "Increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut)",

                "Pancreatic enzyme insufficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the digestive tract wall; elevated levels are a primary marker for 'leaky gut' or intestinal permeability."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Regarding Nutrigenomics, an individual with the MTHFR C677T homozygous polymorphism typically experiences what physiological impact?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR C677T homozygous variant leads to a significant reduction (approx. 70%) in the enzyme's efficiency, necessitating specialized folate support (methylfolate) rather than synthetic folic acid."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NF-kB is a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA; when activated by stress or toxins, it switches on the production of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha."

                "To increase caloric intake after a period of restriction",
                "To satisfy the client's cravings to ensure long-term compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The reintroduction phase is the 'scientific experiment' part of the protocol, where foods are systematically tested to identify bio-individual sensitivities and tolerances."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
