            "question": "Dr. Roger Williams, the pioneer of biochemical individuality, demonstrated that internal organs can vary in size and shape among healthy individuals by as much as:",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "25-30%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In his 1956 landmark work, Dr. Williams showed that anatomical variations in healthy humans are vast, with some organs and chemical requirements varying by 2 to 10 times between individuals."

            "question": "A client presents with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism. Based on nutrigenomic principles, which nutritional intervention is most scientifically indicated?",
            "options": [
                "Supplementing with high-dose synthetic Folic Acid",
                "Increasing intake of bioactive 5-MTHF (methylfolate) and B12",
                "Avoiding all green leafy vegetables",
                "Reducing protein intake to under 10% of total calories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR C677T SNP reduces the body's ability to convert synthetic folic acid into its active form (5-MTHF). Providing methylfolate bypasses this genetic bottleneck."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to the Metabolic Typing model, a 'Fast Oxidizer' typically requires which macronutrient ratio to maintain stable energy and blood sugar?",
            "options": [
                "High Carbohydrate (70%), Low Protein (15%), Low Fat (15%)",

                "Zero Carbohydrate, High Saturated Fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fast oxidizers burn glucose rapidly; they require higher levels of protein and fat (which burn more slowly) and fewer carbohydrates to prevent rapid blood sugar spikes and crashes."

                "IgE involves the immune system; IgG does not.",
                "IgE reactions are immediate and potentially life-threatening; IgG reactions are delayed and often cumulative.",
                "IgG reactions only occur in the respiratory tract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IgE antibodies trigger immediate mast cell degranulation (anaphylaxis risk), while IgG antibodies create immune complexes that cause delayed inflammatory symptoms 12-72 hours after ingestion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The rise in progesterone following ovulation increases thermogenesis, raising the BMR by 5-10%, which often correlates with increased caloric demand and appetite."

            "id": "q3_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melanopsin receptors in the eyes are highly sensitive to blue light; exposure at night signals the SCN to suppress melatonin, leading to sleep fragmentation and metabolic disruption."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs are xenoestrogens or other hormone mimics that interfere with the endocrine system, often leading to 'estrogen dominance' and altered gene expression."

            "options": [
                "It is the most expensive and therefore the most accurate.",
                "It bypasses the limitations of blood tests by observing the direct physiological response to reintroduction.",
                "It allows the client to eat whatever they want during the challenge phase.",
                "It is the only way to test for IgE allergies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While blood tests (IgG) can have false positives/negatives, the elimination and reintroduction process provides direct evidence of how a specific body reacts to a specific food in real-time."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sympathetic dominant types are already in a 'fight or flight' state; they benefit most from interventions that stimulate the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic (rest and digest) system."
