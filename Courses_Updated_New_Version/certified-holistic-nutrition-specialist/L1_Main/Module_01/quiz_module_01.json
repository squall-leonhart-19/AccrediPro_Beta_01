            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Foundations of Holistic Intake' beyond simply collecting physiological data?",
            "options": [
                "To establish a therapeutic alliance and identify the client's 'Internalized Motivation'",
                "To provide an immediate diagnosis of nutritional deficiencies",
                "To sell a standardized 30-day supplement protocol",
                "To replace the need for clinical blood chemistry"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In holistic nutrition, the intake is as much about building rapport and understanding the client's 'why' (motivation) as it is about data, as this predicts long-term compliance."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "When analyzing a 3-Day Food Record, why is it critical to include at least one weekend day?",
            "options": [
                "Metabolism slows down significantly on weekends",
                "To capture the 'Hawthorne Effect' more accurately",
                "Social, environmental, and dietary patterns often shift significantly from weekday routines",
                "Weekend data is required for insurance reimbursement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dietary patterns are rarely consistent throughout the week; weekend days typically reflect different social stressors, alcohol consumption, and meal timings that impact metabolic health."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client completes a Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) and receives a total score of 115. How is this score interpreted in a functional assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Low symptom burden; lifestyle maintenance required",
                "Moderate symptom burden; focus on one specific organ",
                "High/Severe symptom burden; indicates significant systemic imbalance",
                "Invalid result; the MSQ only goes up to 100"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In most functional MSQ scaling, a score over 100 represents a high/severe symptom burden, suggesting that multiple body systems are under stress and require comprehensive support."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "From a functional perspective, what is the 'Optimal' range for Fasting Blood Glucose, as opposed to the broader 'Pathological' clinical range?",
            "options": [
                "60 - 70 mg/dL",
                "75 - 86 mg/dL",
                "95 - 110 mg/dL",
                "120 - 140 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While clinical labs may not flag 'high' until 100 mg/dL, functional nutritionists look for an optimal range of 75-86 mg/dL to identify early insulin resistance or dysglycemia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which physiological state is most likely to result in an artificially 'high' body fat percentage reading during Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperhydration",
                "Dehydration",
                "High muscle mass",
                "Recent consumption of a high-carbohydrate meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BIA measures the resistance of electrical flow. Since water conducts electricity and fat resists it, a dehydrated state increases resistance, which the device interprets as higher body fat."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "During a physical assessment, you observe 'Koilonychia' (spoon-shaped nails) in a client. Which nutrient deficiency does this clinical sign most likely suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Zinc",
                "Iron",
                "Vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Koilonychia is a classic physical sign of chronic iron deficiency (hypochromic anemia) and warrants further investigation via a full iron panel (Ferritin, TIBC, Serum Iron)."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "What does the term 'Allostatic Load' represent in the context of a lifestyle assessment?",
            "options": [
                "The total amount of calories burned during exercise",
                "The cumulative 'wear and tear' on the body resulting from chronic exposure to stress",
                "The maximum amount of protein the liver can process in 24 hours",
                "The percentage of heavy metals found in a hair tissue mineral analysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the physiological consequences of chronic exposure to fluctuating or elevated neural or neuroendocrine responses which result from repeated or chronic stress."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "When synthesizing the Baseline Report, why is 'Digestion and Absorption' usually addressed before 'Advanced Supplementation'?",
            "options": [
                "Supplements are too expensive for most clients",
                "Digestion is the only system that can be measured accurately",
                "If the GI tract is not functioning, the client cannot effectively absorb or utilize nutrients/supplements",
                "It is a legal requirement for holistic practitioners"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Northward' flow of health dictates that we must ensure the body can actually break down and assimilate nutrients before adding concentrated supplemental doses."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client presents with 'Frank's Sign' (a diagonal crease in the earlobe). Based on clinical correlations, which system should be prioritized for further screening?",
            "options": [
                "Digestive system",
                "Cardiovascular system",
                "Endocrine system",
                "Lymphatic system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frank's Sign has been correlated in numerous studies with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "According to nutritional research on dietary recall bias, by what percentage do individuals (particularly those with higher BMIs) typically underreport their actual caloric intake?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-20%",
                "30-40%",
                "60-70%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as those using doubly labeled water) consistently show that self-reported intake is often 30-40% lower than actual consumption due to social desirability bias and memory gaps."
