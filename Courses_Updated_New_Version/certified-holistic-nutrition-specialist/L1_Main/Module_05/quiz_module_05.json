            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions create a pre-determined response to a specific cue (If X happens, then I will do Y), which reduces the cognitive load and reliance on willpower during stressful moments."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Crowding Out' strategy is prioritized over restrictive dieting. What is the primary physiological benefit of this approach?",

                "It increases nutrient density and fiber, naturally reducing the intake of ultra-processed foods",
                "It forces the body into a state of ketosis within 48 hours",
                "It prevents the absorption of dietary cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By focusing on adding nutrient-dense, high-fiber whole foods, the client feels more satiated, which naturally reduces the desire and physical space for less healthy, calorie-dense options."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The Cephalic Phase Digestive Response (CPDR), discussed in Lesson 3, can account for what percentage of total gastric secretion during a meal?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the Cephalic Phase (the taste, smell, and thought of food) accounts for approximately 30-40% of total gastric secretions, highlighting the importance of mindful eating for optimal digestion."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choice architecture suggests that we are more likely to consume what is most visible and easiest to reach. Placing water in the immediate visual field reduces the friction of the habit."

            "id": "q5_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modular meal prep focuses on 'building blocks' rather than fixed recipes, which prevents 'palate fatigue' and allows for flexibility based on the client's daily cravings or schedule."
