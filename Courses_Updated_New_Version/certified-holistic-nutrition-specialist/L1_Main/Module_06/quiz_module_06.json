            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of habit formation, which brain structure is responsible for 'chunking' behaviors into automatic routines, allowing the prefrontal cortex to remain offline?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The basal ganglia (specifically the striatum) is the primary site for habit automation, storing 'chunked' routines that can be executed with minimal conscious effort from the prefrontal cortex."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Which principle of Choice Architecture involves increasing the 'interaction cost' or physical effort required to engage in an undesirable behavior?",

                "Adding Friction",
                "Nudging"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adding friction involves making a habit harder to perform (e.g., placing snacks in a high, opaque cabinet), which utilizes the brain's natural tendency to choose the path of least resistance."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A client uses 'Component Batching' (preparing separate proteins, starches, and fats) rather than full recipes. What is the primary systemic benefit of this approach?",
            "options": [
                "It guarantees a lower caloric intake per meal",
                "It reduces decision fatigue by providing a 'Plug and Play' framework",
                "It eliminates the need for any grocery shopping during the week",
                "It increases the thermic effect of food (TEF)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Component batching is a scalable system that reduces the cognitive load of 'what to eat' by providing pre-prepped building blocks that can be combined in various ways, preventing decision fatigue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An effective anchor must be a specific, consistent, and automatic behavior already present in the daily routine, such as brushing teeth or pouring a cup of coffee."

            "options": [
                "The ability to go 4-6 hours between meals without significant cognitive or energy crashes",
                "Losing at least 2 pounds of scale weight every week consistently",
                "The ability to eat processed sugars without any rise in blood glucose",
                "Maintaining a resting heart rate below 50 BPM at all times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic resilience (or flexibility) is characterized by the body's ability to switch between fuel sources efficiently, resulting in stable energy and mood even when meals are delayed."

            "options": [
                "To calculate the exact number of grams of fiber needed",
                "To replace the need for any nutritional knowledge",
                "To rebuild interoceptive awareness and sensitivity to leptin/ghrelin signals",
                "To ensure the client never reaches a level 4 on the scale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hunger-Satiety Scale is a tool used to move from external tracking (apps) to internal cues, helping clients reconnect with physiological signals of hunger and fullness."

                "A client eats more because they believe a food is 'healthy'",
                "A minor dietary slip-up leads to a complete abandonment of goals for the day",
                "Metabolism slows down significantly during a calorie deficit",
                "Social pressure forces a client to eat foods they don't like"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'What-the-Hell Effect' occurs when a perceived violation of a rigid dietary rule leads to a 'total loss' mindset, causing the individual to overeat significantly since the day is already 'ruined.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "System-based red flags focus on the breakdown of habits (the system) rather than minor caloric deviations. Skipping anchor habits for several days suggests the underlying structure is failing."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "According to the 2009 study by Lally et al., how long does it take on average for a new health behavior to reach 'peak automaticity'?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the '21-day myth' persists, Lally et al. found that it takes an average of 66 days for a behavior to become a habit, with a range of 18 to 254 days depending on complexity."
