            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is the essential cofactor for the 5'-deiodinase enzymes responsible for converting the pro-hormone T4 into the biologically active T3?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine",
                "Selenium",
                "Manganese",
                "Copper"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While iodine is required for the production of T4, selenium is the critical cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes that remove an iodine atom to create active T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In clinical assessment, a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score above which value is generally considered indicative of early-stage insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "0.5",
                "1.0",
                "1.9",
                "4.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score > 1.9 indicates the beginning of insulin resistance, while scores > 2.9 indicate significant insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Which enzyme, often upregulated by high insulin levels and excess adipose tissue, is responsible for the 'aromatization' of testosterone into estradiol?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase",
                "5-alpha reductase",
                "COMT",
                "Beta-glucuronidase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Aromatase is the enzyme that converts androgens (like testosterone) into estrogens. High insulin and obesity significantly increase its activity."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "A client exhibits a 'blunted' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) characterized by a less than 50% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. This is most often associated with which clinical state?",
            "options": [
                "Acute 'Fight or Flight' response",
                "Hyperthyroidism",
                "Chronic HPA axis exhaustion (Burnout)",
                "Cushing's Syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A blunted CAR is a hallmark of HPA axis dysfunction where the body can no longer mount an appropriate morning cortisol surge, often due to chronic long-term stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to the principles of 'Circadian Nutrition,' why should large carbohydrate-rich meals be avoided late at night?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin secretion inhibits insulin production from the pancreas.",
                "Cortisol levels are at their peak at night, causing fat storage.",
                "The liver stops processing glucose after 8:00 PM.",
                "Digestive enzymes are only produced during daylight hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin and insulin have an inverse relationship; as melatonin rises to prepare the body for sleep, it binds to receptors on the pancreas that reduce insulin secretion, leading to impaired glucose tolerance at night."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Which specific enzyme, produced by certain gut bacteria (the estrobolome), can deconjugate estrogens in the GI tract, leading to their reabsorption into the bloodstream?",
            "options": [
                "Sulphotransferase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Cytochrome P450",
                "Glutathione S-transferase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the 'de-toxified' estrogen to be reabsorbed, contributing to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "When addressing hormonal imbalances in a clinical setting, which 'foundational' system should be stabilized first according to the module's hierarchy of intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid hormone replacement",
                "Adrenal adaptogen therapy",
                "Blood sugar and insulin sensitivity",
                "Estrogen detoxification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blood sugar stability is the 'master lever.' Dysglycemia creates systemic stress that disrupts the HPA axis, thyroid function, and sex hormone metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A client has a high 16α-hydroxyestrone (16-OH) level relative to 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH) on a functional hormone test. Which intervention is most specifically targeted at shifting metabolism toward the 2-OH pathway?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium glycinate",
                "Vitex (Chasteberry)",

                "Licorice root"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DIM and Indole-3-Carbinol (found in cruciferous vegetables) specifically promote the Phase 1 cytochrome P450 pathway that favors 2-OH (the 'protective' estrogen) over 16-OH."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Which amino acid is the direct precursor for the synthesis of both Thyroid hormones (T4) and the adrenal catecholamines (Dopamine, Norepinephrine)?",
            "options": [
                "L-Tryptophan",
                "L-Tyrosine",

                "L-Glutamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tyrosine is the structural backbone for thyroid hormones (when combined with iodine) and the starting point for catecholamine synthesis in the adrenals."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which chronic systemic inflammation (elevated IL-6 and TNF-alpha) leads to 'euthyroid sick syndrome' or poor T4-to-T3 conversion?",
            "options": [
                "It destroys the thyroid gland directly.",
                "It increases the production of Reverse T3 (rT3), an inactive 'brake' on metabolism.",
                "It causes the kidneys to excrete iodine too rapidly.",
                "It prevents the pituitary from producing TSH."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammatory cytokines inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme while stimulating the 5-deiodinase enzyme, which converts T4 into Reverse T3 instead of active T3."
