            "options": [
                "RCA focuses on suppressing symptoms with high-dose supplements instead of pharmaceutical drugs.",
                "RCA seeks to identify the 'upstream' physiological imbalances that drive 'downstream' symptoms.",
                "RCA relies exclusively on genetic testing to determine a client's health outcomes.",
                "RCA ignores the client's current symptoms to focus solely on their childhood health history."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Root Cause Analysis shifts the focus from 'what' the symptom is to 'why' it is occurring by identifying upstream drivers like inflammation, gut dysbiosis, or metabolic dysfunction."
