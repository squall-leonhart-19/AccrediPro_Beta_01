            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RCTs are designed to minimize bias through randomization and control groups, making them the gold standard for establishing causality, whereas observational studies only show correlation."

            "question": "A study reports that a new supplement 'reduces the risk of heart disease by 50%.' If the actual risk dropped from 4% to 2%, what is the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Absolute Risk Reduction is the simple arithmetic difference between the control group risk and the experimental group risk (4% - 2% = 2%). The '50%' figure is the Relative Risk Reduction, which can often be misleading."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of < 0.05 is the standard threshold for 'statistical significance,' meaning the results are unlikely to have occurred due to chance alone, though it does not guarantee 'clinical significance.'"
