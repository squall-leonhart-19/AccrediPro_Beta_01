            "question": "A client presents with a fasting insulin of 18 µIU/mL and fasting glucose of 105 mg/dL. Using the HOMA-IR calculation (Glucose x Insulin / 405), what is their score and clinical status?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 - Optimal insulin sensitivity",
                "2.6 - Early stage insulin resistance",
                "4.6 - Significant insulin resistance",
                "8.2 - Severe Type 2 Diabetes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The calculation (105 * 18) / 405 equals approximately 4.66. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early resistance, while a score above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the context of autoimmunity and the 'Gut-Immune Connection,' which protein is the primary modulator of intestinal permeability by regulating tight junctions?",
            "options": [
                "Albumin",
                "Zonulin",
                "Calprotectin",
                "Secretory IgA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. High levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability ('leaky gut') and autoimmune triggers."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia exacerbates PCOS symptoms in high-stress female clients?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)",
                "It suppresses the production of Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "It stimulates the ovarian theca cells to produce excess androgens and suppresses SHBG",
                "It directly converts estrogen into DHT in the peripheral tissues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH to stimulate androgen production in the ovaries and simultaneously inhibits the liver's production of SHBG, leading to higher levels of free, active testosterone."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A client with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) shows evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Which 'shuttle' nutrient is required to transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation?",
            "options": [
                "L-Carnitine",
                "Coenzyme Q10",
                "Riboflavin (B2)",
                "Alpha-Lipoic Acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L-Carnitine is essential for the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system, which shuttles fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix to be used for ATP production."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In cases of Histamine Intolerance, which enzyme is primarily responsible for the breakdown of extracellular histamine in the digestive tract?",
            "options": [
                "Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT)",
                "Diamine Oxidase (DAO)",
                "Amylase",
                "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DAO is the primary enzyme for breaking down histamine consumed in food (extracellular). HNMT handles intracellular histamine breakdown, primarily in the liver and central nervous system."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "When assessing an elite athlete for 'Overtraining Syndrome' (OTS), which biomarker ratio is most indicative of an anabolic/catabolic imbalance?",
            "options": [
                "The LDL to HDL ratio",
                "The Testosterone to Cortisol ratio",
                "The Sodium to Potassium ratio",
                "The Glucose to Insulin ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The free testosterone to cortisol ratio is a widely used marker in sports science to determine if an athlete is recovering or in a state of chronic catabolic stress (OTS)."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "The 'Tryptophan Steal' pathway, often seen in clients with chronic neuroinflammation, results in the production of which neurotoxic metabolite?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin",
                "Melatonin",
                "Quinolinic Acid",
                "5-HTP"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under inflammatory conditions, tryptophan is diverted away from the serotonin pathway and toward the kynurenine pathway, producing Quinolinic Acid, which is neuroexcitatory and potentially neurotoxic."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In a 'Multi-Systemic' case where a client has mold illness, heavy metals, and gut dysbiosis, what is the 'Drainage First' principle?",
            "options": [
                "Starting high-dose binders immediately",
                "Aggressive anti-parasitic herbal protocols",
                "Ensuring pathways of elimination (liver, bile, colon, lymph) are open before mobilizing toxins",
                "A 3-day water fast to reset the immune system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Drainage First' principle ensures that the body can actually export toxins once they are mobilized. If elimination pathways are blocked, the client often experiences severe 'Herxheimer' or flare-up reactions."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client with Perimenopause presents with heavy periods, anxiety, and insomnia. This 'Estrogen Dominance' pattern is frequently caused by which underlying factor in advanced cases?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive intake of cruciferous vegetables",
                "Anovulatory cycles leading to low progesterone production",
                "High levels of SHBG",
                "Excessive conversion of testosterone to DHT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In perimenopause, cycles often become anovulatory (no egg released). Without ovulation, the corpus luteum does not form, leading to a deficiency in progesterone to oppose estrogen."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "Research on the Gut-Brain axis suggests that what percentage of the body's serotonin is produced by the enterochromaffin cells in the gut?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "50%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90-95% of the body's total serotonin is produced in the gut, where it regulates intestinal motility and communicates with the CNS via the vagus nerve."
