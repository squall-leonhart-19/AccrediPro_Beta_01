            "question": "In the context of elite performance, what is the primary indicator of high 'metabolic flexibility'?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to maintain a high heart rate for extended durations without fatigue.",
                "The efficient transition between utilizing fatty acids and glucose as fuel sources based on intensity.",
                "Consistently maintaining a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 1.0 during low-intensity exercise.",
                "The capacity to store over 2,000 calories of glycogen in the liver alone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility refers to the body's ability to switch fuel sources efficiently. High flexibility allows an athlete to burn fat at lower intensities (sparing glycogen) and switch to glucose for high-intensity bursts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 3-4 month preconception window is vital because it covers the full cycle of egg maturation (oogenesis) and sperm production (spermatogenesis), during which nutritional status directly influences epigenetic markers."

                "Supplements can mimic the effect of pharmaceutical immunosuppressants.",
                "Autoimmune conditions are caused exclusively by environmental toxins mimicking hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses a foreign protein (like gluten or a pathogen) with the body's own tissues due to structural similarities, leading to cross-reactive autoimmunity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF, often called 'brain fertilizer,' is most effectively boosted through the synergistic effect of DHA (which provides the structural building blocks) and aerobic exercise (which triggers the expression of the BDNF gene)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zinc is a critical cofactor for gustin, a protein involved in the production of taste buds. Zinc deficiency can lead to a reduced or distorted sense of taste, contributing to sensory food aversions in children."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Warburg Effect describes how cancer cells upregulate glucose uptake and fermentation to lactate, even when oxygen is available, providing a rationale for managing glycemic load in oncology nutrition."

                "Selenium prevents Iodine from being absorbed in the gut.",
                "Selenium is required for the glutathione peroxidase enzymes that protect the thyroid from oxidative damage during iodine metabolism.",
                "Iodine and Selenium compete for the same transport receptors in the thyroid.",
                "Selenium is only necessary if the client is also deficient in Vitamin C."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iodine stimulates the production of H2O2 in the thyroid. Without adequate Selenium (as glutathione peroxidase), this H2O2 can cause oxidative damage to the thyroid gland, potentially exacerbating autoimmune flares."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system (the brain's waste clearance system) is most active during deep sleep. Avoiding food 3 hours before bed lowers insulin and allows for better glymphatic activation and metabolic cleanup."
