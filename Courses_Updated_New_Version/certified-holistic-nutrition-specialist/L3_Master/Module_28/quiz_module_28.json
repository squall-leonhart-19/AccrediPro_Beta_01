            "question": "When performing an L3 triage for a client in acute nutritional decline, which 'Red Flag' requires immediate cessation of the holistic consultation and referral to emergency services?",
            "options": [
                "A 10% weight loss over the last 6 months",
                "New-onset confusion, jaundice, and asterixis (hand flapping)",
                "A reported decrease in appetite due to emotional stress",
                "Chronic fatigue that has worsened over several weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Confusion, jaundice, and asterixis are signs of hepatic encephalopathy, a medical emergency indicating acute-on-chronic liver failure that is outside the scope of holistic management until stabilized."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the context of Multi-System Failure, specifically Cardiorenal Syndrome, why is aggressive fluid restriction potentially dangerous for renal function?",
            "options": [
                "It causes excessive potassium retention in the distal tubules",
                "It may lead to pre-renal azotemia by reducing renal perfusion pressure",
                "It increases the risk of metabolic alkalosis",
                "It stimulates the overproduction of Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While fluid restriction is often used for cardiac congestion, over-restriction can drop blood pressure and reduce blood flow to the kidneys (renal perfusion), leading to pre-renal azotemia and worsening kidney failure."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Nutritional Psychiatry interventions for acute mental health crises focus heavily on the 'Inflammatory Model of Depression.' Which nutrient dosage is supported by a 2019 meta-analysis for reducing neuro-inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "100mg of Vitamin C daily",
                "At least 1,000mg to 2,000mg of pure EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid)",
                "500mcg of Biotin",
                "Low-dose Calcium Carbonate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-dose EPA (specifically ratios higher in EPA than DHA) has been shown in meta-analyses to have significant antidepressant effects by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "During an 'Autoimmune Storm' or acute flare, what is the primary goal of the 'Acute Anti-Inflammatory Phase' of the L3 protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive weight loss to reduce adipose tissue inflammation",
                "Introduction of high-fiber raw vegetables to scrub the gut",
                "Stabilizing the Th17 response and quenching the cytokine cascade",
                "Eliminating all fats from the diet to prevent lipid peroxidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Th17 pathway is a major driver of tissue destruction in autoimmune flares; nutritional interventions aim to modulate this response and reduce the 'storm' of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "How does Cancer Cachexia (Metabolic Oncology) differ fundamentally from simple starvation?",
            "options": [
                "Cachexia can be fully reversed by increasing caloric intake",
                "Starvation involves a loss of fat, while Cachexia involves an inflammatory loss of lean muscle mass that is resistant to conventional feeding",
                "Cachexia only occurs in the final 24 hours of life",
                "Starvation increases the basal metabolic rate, while Cachexia decreases it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike starvation, where the body conserves protein, cachexia is an inflammatory state where the body actively breaks down muscle (proteolysis) due to tumor-host interactions, making it resistant to simple caloric increases."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In Reactive Sensitivity Syndromes like CIRS (Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), what does the concept of 'Total Body Burden' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The total weight of the patient in kilograms",
                "The cumulative effect of environmental toxins, pathogens, and emotional stress on the immune system's threshold",
                "The amount of protein required to maintain nitrogen balance",
                "The total number of supplements a client is currently taking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total Body Burden is the sum of all stressors (biotoxins, chemicals, heavy metals, etc.) that eventually overwhelm the body's homeostatic mechanisms, leading to multi-systemic sensitivity."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In Palliative Nutrition, if a terminally ill patient expresses a desire to stop eating despite family pressure to 'keep up their strength,' what is the L3 practitioner's ethical obligation?",
            "options": [
                "To insist the patient drinks high-calorie meal replacements",
                "To explain that they will die faster if they don't eat",
                "To support the patient's autonomy and focus on comfort-based feeding (pleasure over calories)",
                "To refer the case to a psychiatrist for 'refusal of treatment'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical palliative care prioritizes the patient's autonomy and comfort. Forcing food in the end-of-life stage can cause distress, aspiration, and fluid overload (edema)."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "What is the hallmark electrolyte abnormality associated with Refeeding Syndrome in a severely malnourished oncology patient?",
            "options": [
                "Hypernatremia (High Sodium)",
                "Hypophosphatemia (Low Phosphorus)",
                "Hypercalcemia (High Calcium)",
                "Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypophosphatemia is the classic hallmark of Refeeding Syndrome, as the shift from catabolism to anabolism causes cells to rapidly pull phosphorus from the blood to create ATP."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a critical component of an L3 Practitioner's 'Collaborative Care Agreement' when working with complex cases?",
            "options": [
                "A guarantee that the client will be cured within 90 days",
                "A statement that the nutritionist's advice supersedes the oncologist's advice",
                "Clear definitions of roles, communication channels with the medical team, and emergency protocols",
                "A list of all the medical doctor's faults and previous errors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L3 cases require high-level collaboration. A formal agreement ensures all providers are on the same page regarding the client's safety, goals, and emergency procedures."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), why is a 'Low Histamine Diet' often insufficient as a standalone long-term strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Because histamine is the only trigger for mast cells",
                "Because it does not address the underlying 'root' triggers like mold, occult infections, or chemical sensitivities",
                "Because histamine is an essential vitamin",
                "Because mast cells do not actually release histamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While a low-histamine diet helps manage symptoms, mast cells can be triggered by many other factors (vibration, heat, stress, chemicals). Addressing the 'root' triggers is necessary for long-term stabilization."
