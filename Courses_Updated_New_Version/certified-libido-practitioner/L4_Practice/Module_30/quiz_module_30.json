            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to charge lower rates to attract more clients.",
                "It reduces the need for clinical documentation and legal oversight.",
                "It positions the practitioner as a specialist for a specific population, increasing perceived value and referral trust.",
                "It eliminates the need for a referral network since the practitioner handles everything."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Niche specialization allows a practitioner to master a specific area (e.g., postpartum libido), which increases their value, makes marketing more targeted, and builds trust within referral networks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must stay within their scope. Diagnosing or treating clinical depression is outside the scope of a Libido Practitioner, requiring a referral to a licensed therapist or psychiatrist."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the outcome and the significance of the problem being solved (the transformation) rather than just the time spent (dollars-for-hours)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' stands for Somatic/Stress. Libido is heavily influenced by the nervous system; if a client is in a chronic state of stress (sympathetic dominance), the body deprioritizes sexual desire."
