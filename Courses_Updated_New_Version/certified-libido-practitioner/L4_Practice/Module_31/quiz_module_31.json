            "question": "In Lesson 1: Niche Mastery, why is 'Generalist' positioning considered a liability for a Libido Practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for a wider range of clients, which increases total revenue.",
                "It dilutes perceived authority and makes it difficult to justify high-ticket pricing.",
                "It is the only way to avoid platform shadowbanning.",
                "Most medical doctors prefer referring to generalists rather than specialists."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialization creates 'Expert Bias' in the mind of the consumer. A specialist can charge a premium because they solve a specific, high-stakes problem (libido) rather than general wellness."

            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "The D.E.S.I.R.E. Narrative framework (Lesson 2) emphasizes starting with 'Discovery' and 'Empathy.' What is the primary goal of the 'Empathy' phase?",

                "To provide a clinical diagnosis of the client's hormonal profile.",
                "To normalize the client's experience and lower the 'shame barrier' associated with sexual dysfunction.",
                "To explain the practitioner's credentials and educational background.",
                "To hard-sell the client on a 6-month commitment immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because libido issues are often shrouded in shame, the Empathy phase is critical for building the psychological safety necessary for a client to invest in a solution."

        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Platform Restrictions, what is 'Algospeak' and why is it used?",

                "A technical coding language used to build practitioner websites.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social media algorithms often flag words related to sexual health as 'sensitive' or 'adult' content; Algospeak helps practitioners reach their audience without being shadowbanned."

            "options": [
                "To sell a $27 ebook as a tripwire.",
                "To automate the entire coaching process so the practitioner never speaks to the client.",
                "To pre-qualify the lead and shift the power dynamic from 'seller' to 'authority' before the discovery call.",
                "To provide a list of all supplements the client should take."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Value Injection ensures that when a lead books a call, they are already 'sold' on the methodology, making the discovery call a confirmation of fit rather than a high-pressure sales pitch."

                "Paying for fake reviews to build initial momentum."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blinded case studies (e.g., 'Client X, 45-year-old female') allow you to demonstrate results and expertise without violating the sensitive privacy requirements of sexual health coaching."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This response validates the client while uncovering hidden objections that the client might be projecting onto the spouse, allowing you to coach them through the decision."
