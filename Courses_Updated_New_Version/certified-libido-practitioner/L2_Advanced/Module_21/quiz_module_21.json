            "question": "During the Clinical Synthesis phase (L1), what is the primary objective of 'Thematic Grouping' of client data?",
            "options": [
                "To determine which pharmaceutical intervention is required immediately",
                "To identify intersecting patterns between biological, psychological, and relational drivers",
                "To provide the client with a definitive diagnosis from the DSM-5",
                "To eliminate any data points that do not relate to sexual frequency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical synthesis is about moving beyond isolated symptoms to see how various factors—such as hormonal shifts (biological) and performance anxiety (psychological)—intersect to create the current clinical picture."

            "question": "In the Multimodal Intervention Mapping model (L2), why is 'Stabilization' prioritized before 'Activation'?",
            "options": [
                "Because clients need to increase sexual frequency before they can feel safe",
                "Because activation protocols are ineffective if the nervous system is in a state of high threat or dysregulation",
                "Because insurance providers require a stabilization period for billing purposes",
                "Because stabilization focuses on pharmaceutical interventions while activation focuses on coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attempting to 'ignite' desire (Activation) while a client is in a state of burnout or high sympathetic arousal (dysregulation) typically leads to further withdrawal or 'shutdown' of the libido."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a core component of 'Somatic Awareness' in early-stage planning (L3)?",
            "options": [
                "Interoceptive accuracy—the ability to perceive internal bodily sensations",
                "High-intensity interval training to boost testosterone",
                "Cognitive reframing of negative childhood memories",
                "Using vibrators to increase genital blood flow"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Somatic awareness focuses on interoception. Before a client can feel 'desire,' they must first be able to feel and interpret the subtle sensations of their own body without judgment or fear."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When designing Ignition Protocols for Responsive Desire (L4), the 'Brakes vs. Accelerator' model suggests that the first step should usually be:",
            "options": [
                "Adding more erotic stimuli to the environment",
                "Increasing the frequency of sexual encounters",
                "Identifying and removing 'inhibitors' (the Brakes)",
                "Prescribing testosterone-boosting supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In responsive desire, libido is often suppressed not by a lack of 'accelerants' (arousal), but by the presence of 'inhibitors' (stress, body image issues, lack of privacy). Removing the brakes is more effective than pressing the accelerator harder."

                "A child or family member interfering with the couple's intimacy",
                "The relationship itself, treated as a separate 'client' with its own needs and dynamics",
                "A therapist or coach who joins the couple's sessions",
                "An outside romantic interest or affair"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Treating the relationship as 'The Third Entity' removes blame from individuals and focuses on the health and communication patterns of the partnership as a whole."

            "options": [
                "A client experiences a second wave of desire after the initial treatment",
                "The partner experiences improvements in their own libido as a result of the client's work",
                "The client subconsciously maintains their low libido because it protects them from a perceived greater threat",
                "The practitioner receives a referral from a satisfied client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain occurs when the 'symptom' (low libido) serves a protective function, such as avoiding intimacy that feels emotionally unsafe or maintaining distance in an unhappy marriage."

                "The number of orgasms achieved per month",
                "The reduction in 'Sexual Distress' scores (e.g., using the FSDS-R scale)",
                "The amount of money spent on libido supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High frequency with high distress is not a successful outcome. The primary goal of a Libido Practitioner is to reduce the distress and burden associated with low desire, regardless of the final frequency."

                "Increasing the intensity of ignition protocols to achieve peak performance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Evolution Phase is about sustainability. It moves the client from just 'fixing a problem' to integrating vitality into their lifestyle and having a plan for when life stressors inevitably return."

            "options": [
                "Ignition Protocol -> Relational Alignment -> Somatic Awareness",
                "Somatic Awareness (Stabilization) -> Contextual Adjustment (Brakes) -> Ignition Protocol",
                "Testosterone Supplementation -> Increased Frequency -> Relationship Therapy",
                "Advanced Troubleshooting -> Evolution Phase -> Stabilization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The phased approach requires stabilizing the nervous system (Somatic/Cortisol) and removing inhibitors (Brakes/Context) before attempting to trigger desire (Ignition)."

            "options": [
                "The client reports being 'too tired' for sex on weekdays",
                "The client experiences 'dissociation' or 'flashbacks' during physical touch",
                "The client prefers morning sex over evening sex",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation and flashbacks are clinical indicators of unresolved trauma that fall outside the scope of standard libido coaching and require specialized therapeutic intervention."
