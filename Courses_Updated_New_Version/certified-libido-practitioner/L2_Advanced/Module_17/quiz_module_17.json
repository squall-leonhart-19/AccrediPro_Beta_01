            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy Accounting involves assessing a client's 'energy budget' (often using Spoon Theory) to prioritize intimacy when they are not physically depleted."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves slowing down the process and working in small increments to keep the client within their 'Window of Tolerance' without triggering a trauma response."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 notes that Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) affects over 50% of women. Why is this a 'complex' libido issue?",

                "It is purely psychological and requires no medical intervention.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels from chronic stress signal the body to prioritize survival over reproduction, effectively shutting down the HPG axis and lowering sex hormones."
