            "question": "In Advanced Somatic Mapping (L1), what does the term 'Interoceptive Granularity' specifically refer to in a clinical context?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to distinguish between subtle internal sensations rather than just 'good' or 'bad' feelings",
                "The physical density of nerve endings in the pelvic floor",
                "The speed at which a client can reach peak arousal during a mapping session",
                "The number of distinct erogenous zones identified on a physical map"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive Granularity is the ability to identify and name specific, nuanced physiological sensations, which is a prerequisite for resolving complex somatic blocks."

            "question": "According to the Neuro-Cognitive Reframing lesson (L2), how do 'Sexual Schemas' influence libido?",
            "options": [
                "They act as physical barriers to blood flow in the prefrontal cortex",
                "They are purely biological blueprints determined by DNA at birth",
                "They are cognitive frameworks that filter sexual information and determine the 'meaning' of arousal",
                "They are 24-hour cycles that regulate the release of oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sexual schemas are cognitive structures that organize and guide how an individual perceives, processes, and responds to sexual stimuli and their own desire."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In Chrono-Sexual Optimization (L3), at what time of day do male testosterone levels typically peak, necessitating specific timing for libido interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Between 10:00 PM and Midnight",
                "Between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM",
                "Immediately following the mid-day meal (approx. 1:00 PM)",
                "During the late afternoon 'cortisol dip' (approx. 4:00 PM)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Testosterone levels in men follow a circadian rhythm, peaking in the early morning hours (6-9 AM), which significantly influences sexual motivation and erectile function."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Advanced Relational Alignment (L4) discusses 'Erotic Polarity.' What is the primary goal of creating polarity in a long-term relationship?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure both partners have identical sexual desires at all times",
                "To eliminate all conflict and disagreement within the relationship",
                "To establish a rigid hierarchy where one partner is always dominant",
                "To create 'erotic tension' by emphasizing the differences and 'space' between partners"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Erotic polarity involves maintaining a degree of 'otherness' and tension between partners to prevent the 'habituation' that often kills desire in long-term relationships."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "In Bio-Evolutionary Interventions (L5), what role does 'Hormesis' play in libido optimization?",
            "options": [
                "Using brief, controlled stressors (like cold exposure) to trigger adaptive vitality responses",
                "The complete avoidance of all stress to preserve adrenal function",
                "A surgical procedure used to reset the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hormesis is the biological phenomenon where a beneficial effect results from exposure to low doses of an agent that is otherwise toxic or stressful, such as cold thermogenesis increasing androgen receptor sensitivity."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In Clinical Discovery (L6), a high level of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) is clinically significant because it:",
            "options": [
                "Increases the amount of 'Free' Testosterone available to the tissues",
                "Binds to testosterone, making it biologically inactive and potentially lowering libido",
                "Directly stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain",
                "Is a primary indicator of healthy thyroid function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SHBG acts as a 'sponge' for sex hormones; if SHBG is too high, 'Free' (bioavailable) testosterone will be low, even if 'Total' testosterone appears normal on a lab report."

            "id": "q23_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state provides the physiological sense of safety required for the body to transition into 'Play' or 'Erotic' states without triggering a defensive 'Freeze' response."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'I' in the D.E.S.I.R.E. Framework™ stands for Interoceptive Integration, focusing on bridging the gap between cognitive understanding and felt-sense experience."

            "options": [
                "Hyper-sexuality and increased dopamine sensitivity",
                "No effect, as prolactin only affects lactation",
                "Increased aggression and competitive drive",
                "Suppressed desire and a longer refractory period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Prolactin is a 'desire-dampener' that antagonizes dopamine; elevated levels (hyperprolactinemia) are strongly associated with low libido and sexual dysfunction in both men and women."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Intimacy-Desire Paradox suggests that high levels of 'closeness' can sometimes stifle the 'distance' needed for erotic desire, requiring interventions focused on autonomy and mystery."
