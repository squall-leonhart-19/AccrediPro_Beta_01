            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) and mentions significant unresolved childhood trauma. What is the ethical boundary for a Certified Libido Practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnose the HSDD and begin trauma-informed exposure therapy",
                "Prescribe low-dose testosterone or herbal equivalents to bypass the trauma",
                "Focus on present-day libido education and lifestyle strategies while referring the client to a licensed mental health professional for trauma work",
                "Tell the client that libido coaching cannot proceed until the trauma is fully resolved by a third party"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must operate within their scope of practice. While coaches can address libido through education and lifestyle, clinical trauma and psychiatric diagnoses require referral to licensed therapists or medical professionals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because sexual health coaching involves explicit language and sensitive topics, ethical consent must include a 'no-surprises' agreement regarding the nature of the language and topics discussed to ensure the client feels safe."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Erotic Transference occurs when a client redirects sexual or romantic feelings onto the practitioner. It requires careful boundary management and often supervision to ensure the coaching relationship remains professional."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility acknowledges that a practitioner can never truly 'master' another person's culture and instead prioritizes an open, self-reflective, and client-centered approach."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Amatonormativity is the bias that assumes everyone desires or should prioritize a traditional romantic relationship. Ethically, the practitioner must follow the client's lead on whether their libido level is actually a 'problem' for them."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality is absolute. Without a signed Release of Information (ROI), a practitioner cannot disclose any information to third parties, including spouses or family members."
