            "question": "A client presents with low libido but 'normal' range Total Testosterone (550 ng/dL). Which secondary marker is most likely responsible for the 'Normal Labs Paradox' if their SHBG is high?",
            "options": [
                "Free Testosterone",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)",
                "Blood Glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) binds to testosterone, reducing the 'Free' or bioavailable fraction. A client can have high total levels but insufficient free levels to support libido."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the context of Post-Traumatic Growth (Lesson 2), what is the primary goal of 'Pendulation' in somatic reintegration?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to relive the trauma until they are desensitized",
                "To alternate between a 'resource' (safe sensation) and a 'titrated' traumatic sensation to build nervous system capacity",
                "To use rapid eye movements to erase the traumatic memory entirely",
                "To ensure the client remains in a state of high sympathetic arousal during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation allows the client to move between safety and the edges of trauma, preventing flooding while gradually expanding the 'Window of Tolerance' for physical sensation."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "Which neurodivergent trait is most likely to lead to a 'touched out' feeling, where a client has zero desire for physical intimacy despite loving their partner?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperfocus",
                "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)",
                "Sensory Overload / Overstimulation",
                "Executive Dysfunction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory overload occurs when the brain cannot process further tactile or auditory input. For neurodivergent individuals, a day of 'masking' or sensory input can make any further touch feel painful or intrusive."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In 'Roommate Syndrome,' what is the 'Differentiation' strategy suggested to reignite erotic friction?",
            "options": [
                "Spending 24/7 together to build more emotional closeness",
                "Sharing all passwords and merging all hobbies",
                "Cultivating 'I-ness'—pursuing individual interests and maintaining personal boundaries to create 'space' for desire",
                "Scheduling sex at the same time every day to create a routine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Erotic desire requires a degree of 'otherness' or distance. Over-fusion (becoming 'one person') kills the tension necessary for libido. Differentiation restores that tension."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) can lead to 'secondary' low libido. What is the primary mechanism for this decrease in desire?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden drop in Intelligence Quotient (IQ)",
                "Anticipatory anxiety and fear of pain (dyspareunia) due to vaginal atrophy",
                "An increase in oxytocin levels",
                "Excessive sebum production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GSM causes physical changes that make intercourse painful. The brain learns to associate sex with pain, leading to a protective 'shutting down' of desire (anticipatory avoidance)."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A male client experiences erectile dysfunction and low libido specifically when he is 'spectatoring.' What does this term describe?",
            "options": [
                "A preference for watching adult films over having sex",
                "A dissociative state where he monitors his own performance from a third-person perspective",
                "Watching his partner's reactions to ensure they are satisfied",
                "Comparing his physical attributes to athletes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spectatoring is an internal monitoring process that shifts the brain from the 'experiencing' (parasympathetic) mode to the 'evaluating' (sympathetic/anxiety) mode, which kills arousal."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "For clients with chronic illness or physical disability, the 'Spoon Theory' is used as a metaphor for:",

                "A method for measuring hormone levels at home"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spoon Theory helps clients with chronic illness 'budget' their energy. If all 'spoons' are used for work and survival, there is no energy left for libido, requiring adaptive pacing."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In 'High-Performance Burnout,' the 'Pregnenolone Steal' hypothesis suggests that chronic stress causes the body to:",
            "options": [
                "Convert all Testosterone into Estrogen",
                "Prioritize the production of Cortisol over sex hormones like Progesterone and DHEA",
                "Stop absorbing Vitamin D from the sun",
                "Increase the storage of fat in the midsection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes survival (Cortisol) over reproduction (sex hormones). Pregnenolone, the precursor to both, is diverted toward the cortisol pathway."

                "Removing all sensory toys and distractions",
                "Using 'Body Doubling' during sexual acts",
                "Reducing 'Transition Friction' by creating sensory cues (lighting, music) that signal the brain it is time to switch to 'erotic mode'",
                "Taking a high-dose sedative before intimacy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD brains struggle with transitions. Sensory cues help 'prime' the brain for a change in activity, making it easier to shift from 'task mode' to 'intimacy mode'."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "According to the Module 16 case studies, a client with high cortisol (n=8,234 meta-analysis data) is likely to see what effect on their HPG axis?",
            "options": [
                "Increased sensitivity of the pituitary gland",
                "Suppression of GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) at the hypothalamic level",

                "A 50% increase in oxytocin production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol acts as an inhibitory signal to the hypothalamus, suppressing the release of GnRH, which is the 'master switch' for the entire hormonal cascade of desire."
