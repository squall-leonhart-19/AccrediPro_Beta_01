            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Biopsychosocial Clinical Intake' within the Certified Libido Practitioner™ framework?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a definitive medical diagnosis and prescribe pharmacological interventions",
                "To identify the 'Point of Origin' by mapping the intersection of biological, psychological, and social factors",
                "To focus exclusively on the client's childhood trauma as the source of sexual dysfunction",
                "To replace the need for laboratory testing through verbal interview alone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Biopsychosocial Clinical Intake is designed to look at the client holistically, identifying how biological (hormones/health), psychological (beliefs/mood), and social (relationship/culture) factors intersect to create the current libido state."

        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "When utilizing the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), which total score is the widely accepted clinical cutoff for identifying sexual dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "30.0 or below",
                "15.5 or below",
                "26.55 or below",
                "42.0 or below"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (Wiegel et al., 2005) established 26.55 as the optimal cutoff score to differentiate between women with and without clinically significant sexual dysfunction."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client's lab results show high Total Testosterone but very low Libido. Which biomarker is most likely elevated, causing a decrease in 'Free' or bioavailable testosterone?",
            "options": [
                "Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)",
                "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone, making it unavailable for use by the body's tissues. High SHBG can result in low libido symptoms even if total testosterone appears 'normal' on a lab report."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Sexual Scripts' are described as cognitive blueprints. How do these scripts typically impact libido?",
            "options": [
                "They are biological reflexes that cannot be changed",
                "They dictate the 'who, what, when, and where' of sexual behavior, often creating 'brakes' if the reality doesn't match the script",
                "They are only relevant for individuals with high libido",
                "They refer exclusively to the physical techniques used during intercourse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sexual scripts are internalized social and personal 'rules' for sex. If a client's current experience deviates from their script, it can trigger the inhibitory system (brakes) and lower desire."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "During Somatic Awareness mapping, a client describes feeling 'heavy, cold, and completely disconnected from their pelvic floor.' This most likely indicates which nervous system state?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Shutdown)",
                "Hyper-arousal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is characterized by immobilization, numbness, and dissociation, which often manifests physically as feeling 'heavy' or 'numb' in the body."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Based on the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen) discussed in Lesson 6, what is the most effective intervention for a client with high 'Sexual Inhibition' (SIS)?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the intensity of sexual stimuli (more accelerators)",
                "Identifying and removing the specific stressors or 'brakes' currently active",
                "Taking testosterone supplements regardless of lab levels",
                "Focusing exclusively on physical stamina exercises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model suggests that for many, low libido is not a lack of 'gas' (accelerators) but too much 'brake' (inhibition). Removing the brakes is often more effective than simply adding more stimulation."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "When assessing Relational Alignment (L7), 'Sexual Desire Discrepancy' (SDD) is primarily characterized as:",
            "options": [
                "A medical condition where one partner is asexual",
                "A mismatch in the preferred frequency, timing, or type of sexual activity between partners",
                "A lack of love or emotional intimacy in the relationship",
                "The result of one partner having a personality disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SDD is a relational dynamic, not an individual pathology. It occurs when two partners have different levels of desire or different preferences for sexual expression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Ignition Metrics' (L6), what is 'Spontaneous Desire' compared to 'Responsive Desire'?",
            "options": [
                "Spontaneous desire is only found in men; responsive desire is only found in women",
                "Spontaneous desire arises 'out of the blue,' while responsive desire emerges after physical or emotional stimulation",
                "Spontaneous desire is healthy, while responsive desire is a sign of dysfunction",
                "There is no difference between the two in a clinical setting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spontaneous desire is the 'urge' that appears without external stimuli, whereas responsive desire (common in long-term relationships) requires an 'ignition' or stimulus to begin the arousal process."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A practitioner notices a client has chronically high Prolactin levels. What is the likely impact on the client's libido?",
            "options": [
                "Increased libido due to higher sensitivity",
                "Suppressed libido, as prolactin inhibits dopamine and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)",
                "No impact, as prolactin only affects breastfeeding",
                "Enhanced sexual stamina and faster recovery times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolactin is a 'satiety' hormone. When chronically elevated (hyperprolactinemia), it suppresses the hormones and neurotransmitters (like dopamine) that drive sexual desire."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Why is 'Data Synthesis' (L8) critical for long-term libido coaching success?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to prove the client is wrong about their progress",
                "It helps identify 'lagging indicators' and 'leading indicators' to adjust the protocol before the client loses motivation",
                "It is only used for academic research and has no clinical value",
                "It automates the coaching process so the practitioner doesn't have to talk to the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data synthesis allows the practitioner to see patterns over time, distinguishing between temporary fluctuations and genuine progress, which helps maintain client adherence and refine the intervention."
