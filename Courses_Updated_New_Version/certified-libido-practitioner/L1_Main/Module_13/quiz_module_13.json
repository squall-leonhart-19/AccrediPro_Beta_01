            "options": [
                "Sexual Stimulation; focusing on physical techniques and positions",
                "Social Status; focusing on how the client is perceived by their peer group",

                "Systemic Screening; focusing on laboratory blood work and hormonal panels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "S stands for Somatic Awareness. This phase focuses on the 'Window of Tolerance' and regulating the nervous system to move from a state of stress (Sympathetic) or shutdown (Dorsal Vagal) into a state of safety (Ventral Vagal) where desire can emerge."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by numbness and disconnection, which is the 'freeze' or 'shutdown' response associated with the Dorsal Vagal state of the nervous system."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Based on the Dual Control Model discussed in Lesson 5 (Ignition), if a client has high 'Sexual Inhibition' (Brakes), what is the most effective initial strategy for a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the intensity of the 'Accelerators' (more stimulation)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to the Dual Control Model, it is often more effective to remove the 'Brakes' (inhibitors) than to simply add more 'Accelerators' (stimulants) when libido is suppressed."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "It causes a 'Pregnenolone Steal' and suppresses the HPG (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal) axis",
                "It increases blood flow to the pelvic region too quickly",
                "It makes the brain more sensitive to dopamine",
                "It reduces the body's need for sleep, leading to exhaustion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol (stress) can lead to the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (prioritizing stress hormones over sex hormones) and suppresses the HPG axis, which is the control center for reproductive hormones."

            "question": "Case Study: 'Elena' (42) has normal labs and a loving partner but feels 'too busy' for sex and experiences shame about her body. Using the D.E.S.I.R.E. Framework, where should the practitioner start?",

                "Ignition (I) - Introduce new toys and behavioral triggers",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because Elena's primary issues are cognitive (shame and the 'busy' mindset), the Exploration phase is the most appropriate starting point to deconstruct these barriers."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that what percentage of 'low libido' cases in women are primarily driven by cognitive-emotional factors rather than hormonal deficiencies?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that for many women, desire is 'responsive' and heavily influenced by cognitive, emotional, and relational factors (roughly 70-80%) rather than purely biological ones."
