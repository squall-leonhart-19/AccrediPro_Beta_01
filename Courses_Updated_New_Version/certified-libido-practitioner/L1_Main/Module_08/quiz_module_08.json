                "To provide a temporary fix for erectile dysfunction or vaginal dryness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Evolution Pillar is the final stage of the framework, focusing on moving the client beyond the 'fix' and into a state of sustainable sexual vitality and endocrine longevity."

            "question": "Which biomarker is most critical for monitoring 'Endocrine Longevity' because it dictates the actual amount of 'free' or bioavailable testosterone as a client ages?",

                "Total Estrogen",
                "DHEA-S",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SHBG levels often increase with age, binding to testosterone and making it unavailable to tissues; monitoring and managing SHBG is vital for maintaining libido during the 'Evolution' phase."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, 'Environmental Engineering' refers to the systematic removal of endocrine disruptors. Which specific class of chemicals is known to act as 'Obesogens' that disrupt the HPG axis by mimicking estrogen?",
            "options": [

                "Inert Carbonates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and Bisphenols are potent xenoestrogens that can disrupt the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis, leading to suppressed testosterone and diminished libido."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term desire requires a balance of oxytocin (bonding) and dopamine (novelty). Introducing novel experiences and cognitive reappraisal helps rewire the brain's reward system for the same partner."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Aggressive dieting and fasted cardio can spike SHBG and lower T3, both of which negatively impact the HPG axis and reduce bioavailable testosterone, leading to a desire dip."
