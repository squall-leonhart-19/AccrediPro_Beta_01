            "question": "According to the evolutionary biology concepts in Lesson 1, what is the primary reason the 'Coolidge Effect' poses a challenge for long-term libido in committed relationships?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a permanent down-regulation of oxytocin receptors in the brain",
                "The brain's dopaminergic response to a familiar partner habituates over time, reducing the 'novelty' spark",
                "Long-term partners naturally produce more prolactin, which inhibits all sexual desire",
                "Evolutionarily, humans were never intended to remain in pair-bonds for more than two years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Coolidge Effect refers to the phenomenon where males (and to a lesser extent females) exhibit renewed sexual interest whenever a new female is introduced. In long-term relationships, the lack of novelty leads to dopaminergic habituation."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Lesson 2 highlights a study on sleep restriction. What was the observed percentage decrease in testosterone levels for men who slept only 5 hours per night for one week?",
            "options": [
                "2-5%",
                "5-8%",
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that just one week of sleep restriction (5 hours per night) can drop testosterone levels by 10-15%, which is equivalent to nearly 10-15 years of aging."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, which micronutrient is identified as a critical co-factor for the conversion of cholesterol into testosterone and is frequently depleted by chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium",
                "Zinc",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zinc is essential for the function of the enzymes that convert cholesterol into sex hormones; it is also lost through sweat and during high-stress periods, making it a foundation for libido nutrition."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (Lesson 4) explains that under chronic stress, the body shunts hormone precursors away from DHEA and Progesterone to produce which hormone?",
            "options": [
                "Adrenaline",
                "Insulin",
                "Cortisol",
                "Aldosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Pregnenolone Steal occurs when the HPA axis demands more cortisol to handle stress, consuming the pregnenolone that would otherwise be used to create libido-supporting sex hormones."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Habit Stacking' for sexual wellness. Which of the following is the best example of this psychological principle?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking involves anchoring a new behavior (pelvic floor exercises) to an existing, established habit (brushing teeth), increasing the likelihood of long-term adherence."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Which class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in fragrances and soft plastics is specifically noted in Lesson 6 for its 'anti-androgenic' effects?",

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, how does a 'hypertonic' (overly tight) pelvic floor negatively impact sexual arousal?",
            "options": [
                "It increases blood flow too rapidly, causing oversensitivity",
                "It causes the pelvic bones to shift out of alignment",
                "It restricts vasocongestion by compressing local blood vessels and can lead to pelvic pain",
                "It has no impact on libido, only on the ability to reach orgasm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypertonicity in the pelvic floor can restrict the necessary blood flow (vasocongestion) required for arousal and can make intercourse painful, which psychologically lowers future desire."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Digital Sunset' reduces blue light and psychological stimulation, which helps lower evening cortisol, allowing for better sleep quality and the natural morning testosterone spike."

                "To increase the heart rate to over 150 BPM",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vagal toning stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the state required for sexual arousal and 'feed and breed' functions to occur."
