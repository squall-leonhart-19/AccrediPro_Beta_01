            "question": "According to the Basson Circular Model of Sexual Response discussed in Lesson 1, what is the most common starting point for individuals with 'Responsive Desire'?",
            "options": [
                "Spontaneous sexual hunger or craving",
                "A state of sexual neutrality",
                "Peak physiological arousal",
                "Genital vasocongestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike the linear Master's and Johnson model, the Basson model notes that many individuals (especially women) start at sexual neutrality and move toward arousal through a 'willingness' to be receptive to stimuli."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the Dual Control Model (Lesson 2), a client who struggles to get 'in the mood' despite loving their partner and finding them attractive most likely needs an intervention focused on:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the Sexual Excitation System (SES/Accelerators)",
                "Increasing testosterone levels",
                "Decreasing the Sexual Inhibition System (SIS/Brakes)",
                "Switching partners to trigger the Coolidge Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that for most people with desire struggles, 'hitting the brakes' (SIS) is a more common issue than 'not enough gas' (SES). Removing inhibitors like stress or body shame is often more effective than adding more stimulation."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights the role of Dopamine in ignition. Which of the following best describes the 'Coolidge Effect' in a clinical context?",
            "options": [
                "The decrease in libido due to cold environmental temperatures",
                "The restoration of sexual interest when a new stimulus (novelty) is introduced",
                "The plateau of arousal reached after 20 minutes of foreplay",
                "The inhibitory effect of Prolactin after orgasm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Coolidge Effect is a biological phenomenon where males (and to a lesser extent females) exhibit renewed sexual interest when introduced to new receptive partners or novel stimuli, driven by the dopaminergic seeking system."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "When designing an 'Erotic Atmosphere' (Lesson 5), why is the removal of 'Domestic Reminders' (like laundry or laptops) considered critical for ignition?",
            "options": [
                "They lower oxytocin levels immediately",
                "They act as 'Brakes' by triggering the brain's executive function and 'to-do' list vigilance",
                "They cause a physical allergic reaction that inhibits blood flow",
                "They reduce the partner's physical attractiveness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Domestic cues trigger the 'task-oriented' brain. For ignition to occur, the brain must shift from a state of vigilance/productivity to a state of play and safety."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Behavioral Priming, what is the 'Refractory Period of the Mind'?",
            "options": [
                "The time it takes for dopamine to reset after a high-novelty event",
                "The 20-minute window after an argument where sex is impossible",
                "The gap between a sexual thought and the physical response",
                "The physiological recovery time after orgasm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Behavioral priming helps overcome the 'mental refractory period'—the time it takes for the brain to reset its dopaminergic sensitivity so it can be 'ignited' by desire again."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, Sensory Anchoring is described as a form of Pavlovian Conditioning. For an anchor to be effective, it must be:",
            "options": [
                "Applied only during times of low desire",
                "Unique, consistent, and applied at the peak of the desired state",
                "A visual cue only, as the eyes are the primary erotic organ",
                "Shared with the partner immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To create a strong neurological association (anchor), the stimulus must be unique (not used in daily life), consistent, and timed precisely at the peak of the emotional or physical state."

            "id": "q4_7",

            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Nearly 85%",
                "Less than 2%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates only about 15% of women experience spontaneous desire (desire that appears out of nowhere). The vast majority experience responsive desire, making 'Ignition' protocols essential."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'Contextual Trigger' as defined in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "A specific type of physical touch on the neck",
                "A specific visual fantasy",
                "A weekend getaway at a hotel without children",
                "The scent of a specific pheromone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Contextual triggers refer to the broader environment or situation (the 'where' and 'how') that facilitates safety and receptivity, whereas core triggers are specific stimuli."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client feels 'numb' and has low SES scores. According to Lesson 4, which 'Dopaminergic Ignition' strategy would be most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing on routine and predictability to reduce anxiety",
                "Introducing 'Micro-Novelty' like changing the location or time of intimacy",
                "Increasing the use of 'Brakes' to create tension",
                "Avoiding all sexual thoughts until spontaneous desire returns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For low SES (low gas), the introduction of novelty is the primary way to stimulate the dopaminergic 'seeking' system and re-ignite the drive."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "When creating a 'Personalized Ignition Protocol' (Lesson 8), the 'Transition Phase' refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The time between work/parenting and the erotic encounter",
                "The switch from estrogen to progesterone in the cycle",
                "The moment of penetration",
                "The resolution phase after orgasm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Transition Phase is the intentional bridge used to move a client from their 'daily life' persona (stressed, busy) into their 'erotic' persona. Without this bridge, ignition usually fails."
