        {
            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of desire, which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for the 'wanting' (incentive salience) phase of the mesolimbic pathway rather than the 'liking' (consummatory) phase?",
            "options": ["Serotonin", "Dopamine", "Oxytocin", "Endorphins"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the primary driver of the 'seeking' and 'wanting' phase, fueling the motivation to pursue sexual rewards, whereas opioids/endorphins are more associated with the 'liking' or pleasure of the act itself."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client describes constantly 'watching themselves' during intimacy, evaluating their body shape and performance instead of feeling the sensations. This psychogenic inhibitor is known as:",
            "options": ["Cognitive Reframing", "Somatic Anchoring", "Spectatoring", "Interoceptive Flooding"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spectatoring is a cognitive barrier where an individual adopts a third-person perspective during sex, which increases performance anxiety and activates the 'brakes' (sexual inhibition system)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen), which of the following scenarios describes a high 'Sexual Inhibition System' (SIS) or 'Sensitive Brakes'?",
            "options": ["Feeling aroused easily by visual stimuli despite being in a public place", "Losing all sexual desire immediately upon hearing a minor noise outside the bedroom", "Requiring high-intensity stimulation to achieve orgasm", "Seeking out multiple partners to maintain interest"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High SIS (Sensitive Brakes) means the brain is highly efficient at detecting potential threats or distractions and shutting down arousal to ensure safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "During Somatic Profiling, a practitioner notes the client has low interoceptive awareness. What is the most likely impact on their sexual experience?",
            "options": ["They experience 'over-arousal' and premature climax", "They have difficulty recognizing and 'owning' physiological signs of arousal", "They have an overactive imagination that compensates for physical numbness", "They are highly sensitive to the touch of their partner"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low interoceptive awareness makes it difficult for a client to perceive the subtle internal shifts in heart rate, blood flow, and muscle tension that signal arousal, leading to a sense of 'disconnection'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Which attachment style is statistically most likely to experience 'Sexual Compliance' (consenting to sex when not actually desiring it) to avoid abandonment or gain reassurance?",
            "options": ["Secure", "Anxious-Preoccupied", "Dismissive-Avoidant", "Fearful-Avoidant"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anxious-Preoccupied individuals often use sexuality as a tool for proximity-seeking and emotional reassurance, which can lead to a disconnect from their own authentic desire."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In the context of hormonal interplay, why might a client with 'normal' Total Testosterone levels still experience symptoms of low libido?",
            "options": ["High levels of SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) are limiting Free Testosterone", "Their Cortisol levels are too low", "They have an excess of Vitamin D", "Oxytocin is neutralizing the Testosterone"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone, making it biologically inactive. If SHBG is high, the 'Free Testosterone' (the portion that actually affects libido) may be insufficient even if 'Total' levels look normal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Within the D.E.S.I.R.E. Framework, the 'S' stands for 'Somatic Integration.' What is a key goal of this phase?",
            "options": ["Prescribing specific herbal supplements for blood flow", "Bridging the gap between cognitive 'wanting' and physical 'feeling'", "Analyzing childhood attachment traumas", "Setting long-term relationship goals"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Integration focuses on reconnecting the mind with bodily sensations to ensure the 'arousal' and 'desire' phases are synchronized."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Which brain region is considered the 'integrative center' for sexual behavior, receiving input from the amygdala and regulating the release of dopamine in the MPOA?",
            "options": ["Occipital Lobe", "Medial Preoptic Area (MPOA)", "Cerebellum", "Prefrontal Cortex"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MPOA is a critical node in the 'Sexual Incentive System' that integrates hormonal and sensory information to trigger sexual motivation."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A Libido Practitioner's scope of practice includes which of the following activities?",
            "options": ["Diagnosing Clinical Depression as the cause of low libido", "Adjusting a client's HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) dosage", "Providing education on the Dual Control Model and lifestyle interventions", "Treating acute PTSD through EMDR therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners provide education, coaching, and framework-based interventions. Diagnosing medical/mental health conditions or altering prescriptions is outside the scope and requires referral."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Research on the HPG (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal) axis indicates that chronic stress inhibits libido primarily by:",
            "options": ["Increasing blood flow to the pelvic region", "Increasing GnRH pulsatility", "Suppressing the release of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)", "Lowering Prolactin levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress elevates Cortisol, which inhibits the hypothalamus from releasing GnRH, subsequently lowering LH and FSH, and ultimately decreasing sex hormone production."
