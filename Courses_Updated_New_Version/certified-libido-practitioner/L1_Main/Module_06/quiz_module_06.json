            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Evolution Mindset' is contrasted with the 'Resolution Mindset.' What is the primary characteristic of the Evolution Mindset?",
            "options": [
                "Viewing libido as a problem to be solved within a specific timeframe",
                "Integrating sexual vitality as a permanent, evolving part of one's identity",
                "Focusing exclusively on physiological markers like testosterone levels",
                "Returning to the exact sexual baseline experienced in early adulthood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Evolution Mindset moves away from 'fixing' a temporary issue (Resolution) and toward integrating sexual health as an ongoing, adaptive part of a person's life journey."

            "question": "According to the principles of Biological Sustainability (Lesson 2), what is the primary risk of relying on high-stimulant 'quick fixes' for libido?",
            "options": [
                "They permanently increase the HPA-axis set point",
                "They lead to 'neuro-exhaustion' and desensitization of dopamine receptors",
                "They improve cardiovascular health at the expense of hormones",
                "They cause an immediate and irreversible drop in DHEA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological sustainability focuses on long-term health; quick fixes often overstimulate the system, leading to dopamine receptor downregulation and eventual habituation."

            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Hedonic Adaptation' in the context of long-term relationships. Which mechanism is recommended to combat this neural habituation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Strategic Novelty introduces new stimuli to the brain to bypass hedonic adaptation, which is the tendency for the brain to become less responsive to familiar rewards."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental Architecture involves removing external cues (like work laptops in the bedroom or clutter) that signal stress and inhibit the sexual response system."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "When coaching a client through 'Life’s Seasons' (Lesson 5), specifically perimenopause or andropause, what shift in the desire model is often necessary?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As biological baselines shift during aging, many individuals find that 'Responsive Desire' (desire that emerges after physical stimulation) becomes more prominent than 'Spontaneous Desire.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Desire Drift often starts with the erosion of 'micro-connections'—small, non-sexual touches or emotional bids—long before the actual sexual frequency drops."

                "The client must check in with the practitioner every week for life",
                "The protocol must be regularly assessed and adjusted based on current life stressors and biofeedback",
                "Feedback should only be given when the client experiences a failure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An evolution-based blueprint is dynamic; it requires regular assessment to ensure the interventions still match the client's current physiological and environmental reality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable change occurs when the client's self-identity aligns with their goals. Moving from a 'deficit-based' identity to a 'vitality-based' identity is key to long-term success."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Minimum Viable Connection' (MVC) ensures that even during high-stress seasons, the neural pathways for intimacy are kept active through small, manageable habits."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 20-second rule (derived from habit science) suggests that making a desired habit (like lighting a candle or putting away a phone) 20 seconds easier to do significantly increases the likelihood of follow-through."
