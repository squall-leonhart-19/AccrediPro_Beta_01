            "question": "According to the Practitioner’s Role (L1), what is the primary distinction between a Libido Practitioner and a clinical sex therapist?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner focuses on holistic restoration and lifestyle integration rather than diagnosing clinical pathologies.",
                "The practitioner is legally allowed to prescribe hormonal supplements while a therapist is not.",
                "The practitioner only works with individuals, whereas therapists only work with couples.",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are legally interchangeable in all jurisdictions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Libido practitioners operate within a restoration and wellness framework, focusing on the intersection of biology, psychology, and lifestyle, whereas therapists typically focus on diagnosing and treating DSM-5 defined clinical pathologies."

            "question": "In 'Discovery: Mapping the Biological Landscape' (L2), which biomarker is identified as a critical 'libido killer' when chronically elevated due to the 'Pregnenolone Steal'?",
            "options": [
                "Oxytocin",
                "Progesterone",
                "Cortisol",
                "Dopamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress triggers the 'Pregnenolone Steal,' where the body prioritizes the production of cortisol over sex hormones like progesterone and testosterone, leading to a significant drop in desire."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Applying the Dual Control Model from Lesson 3, which intervention is statistically most effective for a client with a 'sensitive brake system'?",

                "Prescribing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to boost testosterone.",
                "Focusing exclusively on spontaneous desire triggers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that for most individuals, especially women, removing 'brakes' (inhibitors) is more effective for restoring libido than simply adding more 'accelerators' (stimuli)."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In 'Somatic Awareness' (L4), the term 'Interoception' refers to:",

                "The ability to read a partner's non-verbal sexual cues.",
                "The cognitive process of fantasizing to trigger arousal.",
                "The sense of the internal state of the body, which is foundational for feeling desire.",
                "The physical act of skin-to-skin contact during the plateau phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the brain's process of sensing internal bodily signals (heart rate, tension, warmth). Low interoceptive awareness is highly correlated with sexual dysfunction and low desire."

            "id": "q9_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Basson’s model highlights that desire doesn't always come first (spontaneous); it often emerges after physical arousal has begun (responsive), which is common in established relationships."

            "options": [
                "Relationships require total transparency to maintain high levels of lust.",
                "Too much emotional safety can lead to a 'sibling bond' where the mystery required for eroticism is lost.",
                "Couples must experience conflict to maintain sexual tension.",
                "Safety is the only requirement for a healthy libido; eroticism is secondary."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Based on Esther Perel’s work, the paradox suggests that while love seeks closeness and safety, desire requires a degree of distance, mystery, and 'otherness' to thrive."

            "options": [
                "It has no measurable effect on testosterone.",
                "It can result in a 10-15% reduction in testosterone, equivalent to aging 10-15 years.",
                "It causes a temporary spike in testosterone due to adrenaline.",
                "It only affects libido if the sleep restriction continues for over a month."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Leproult & Van Cauter, 2011) show that just one week of sleep restriction significantly drops testosterone levels, which is a primary driver of libido."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physical pain (dyspareunia) can indicate underlying medical conditions like endometriosis, infections, or pelvic floor dysfunction and must be evaluated by a physician."

            "question": "A 42-year-old female client reports 'zero desire' despite loving her partner. She has high stress, poor sleep, and feels 'numb' in her body. Using the Module 9 framework, what is the best first step?",

                "Encouraging her to schedule 'maintenance sex' twice a week."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a client is in a chronic stress/freeze state with low interoception ('numbness'), adding sexual pressure or hormones won't work until the nervous system feels safe and grounded."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Evolution' (L7), what role does the neurotransmitter Dopamine play in the libido cycle?",

                "It is the 'cuddle hormone' responsible for post-coital bonding.",

                "It acts as a sedative to help the body relax after orgasm.",
                "It is primarily responsible for vaginal lubrication and blood flow."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the neurochemical of desire and pursuit (the 'seeking' system). Without sufficient dopamine signaling, the motivation to initiate or engage in sexual activity is significantly diminished."
