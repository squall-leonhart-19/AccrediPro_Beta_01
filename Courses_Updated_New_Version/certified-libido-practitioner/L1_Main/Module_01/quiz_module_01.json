            "question": "When applying the Bio-Psycho-Social lens to libido discovery, which factor would be categorized under the 'Social' pillar?",
            "options": [
                "Neurotransmitter imbalances such as low dopamine",
                "Internalized cultural scripts regarding gender and pleasure",
                "The physiological impact of chronic cortisol elevation",
                "Individual attachment styles formed in childhood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social factors include external influences such as cultural expectations, relationship dynamics, religious upbringing, and societal scripts about how one 'should' experience desire."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the context of biological benchmarks, why is an assessment of Prolactin levels crucial during the discovery phase?",
            "options": [
                "Prolactin is the primary hormone responsible for vaginal lubrication",
                "Prolactin increases the sensitivity of the 'accelerator' system",
                "Hyperprolactinemia can suppress GnRH, leading to significantly lowered testosterone and desire",
                "Prolactin levels are a direct marker of thyroid health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) acts as a biological 'brake' by inhibiting Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH), which in turn lowers the production of sex hormones and suppresses dopamine."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client describes 'Mental Load' as a primary barrier. According to the psychological profiling lesson, how does the 'Pregnenolone Steal' impact libido?",
            "options": [
                "It causes an overproduction of estrogen",
                "It redirects hormonal precursors to favor cortisol production over sex hormones",
                "It increases the body's sensitivity to oxytocin",
                "It prevents the absorption of dietary fats needed for cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' occurs under chronic stress when the body prioritizes the production of cortisol (survival) over the production of libido-supporting hormones like progesterone and testosterone."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Lesson 5), which of the following is an example of 'activating the brakes'?",

                "Increasing the frequency of non-sexual touch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'brakes' (Sexual Inhibition System) are activated by perceived threats, distractions, or stressors—such as the sound of a child—which signal to the brain that it is not a safe or appropriate time for sex."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which specific side effect of SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) is often the most difficult to identify without targeted discovery questions?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "During a Trauma-Informed inquiry, what is the primary purpose of 'titration' in the conversation?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner gets every detail of the traumatic event",
                "To slow down the intake process so the client does not become overwhelmed or dysregulated",
                "To determine the exact dosage of supplements required",
                "To compare the client's experience against a standardized scale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves slowing the pace of discovery and processing information in small, manageable 'doses' to prevent the client's nervous system from entering a state of hyper-arousal or dissociation."

            "id": "q1_7",

                "They have a hormonal deficiency that requires immediate medical intervention",
                "Their desire emerges in response to physical stimulation or erotic context rather than starting spontaneously",
                "They lack an 'accelerator' system in their Dual Control Model",
                "They are experiencing a permanent side effect of past medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Responsive desire is a normal variation where desire is triggered by arousal and physical/emotional stimulation, rather than appearing as a spontaneous 'itch' or drive."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter of the 'reward and pursuit' system; it drives the motivation and 'wanting' aspect of libido."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course suggests that what percentage of sexual dysfunction cases have a significant 'Contextual' (Social/Environmental) component?",
