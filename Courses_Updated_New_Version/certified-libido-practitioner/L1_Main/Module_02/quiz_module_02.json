            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model discussed in Lesson 1, what occurs when a client's 'Sexual Inhibition System' (SIS) is chronically overactive?",
            "options": [
                "The Sexual Excitation System (SES) increases to compensate for the imbalance.",
                "The 'brakes' override the 'accelerator,' making it difficult to reach arousal even with high-quality stimulation.",
                "Spontaneous desire increases while responsive desire decreases.",
                "The client experience a 'rebound effect' leading to hypersexuality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SIS acts as the 'brakes' of the sexual response. When chronically overactive due to stress or trauma, it inhibits the SES (the accelerator), preventing arousal regardless of the presence of excitatory stimuli."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client states, 'If I don't get an erection within the first five minutes, the whole night is a failure.' This is an example of which sexual cognitive distortion?",

                "Mind Reading",
                "Emotional Reasoning",
                "All-or-Nothing Thinking",
                "Catastrophizing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "All-or-Nothing (or Dichotomous) thinking views sexual encounters in binary terms (success or failure), ignoring the spectrum of intimacy and pleasure that exists regardless of physiological markers."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 3, how do 'Sexual Scripts' influenced by purity culture typically impact female libido?",
            "options": [
                "They encourage 'responsive desire' as a primary mode of connection.",
                "They create a 'Gatekeeper' narrative that associates female desire with shame or lack of virtue.",
                "They promote sexual agency by defining clear boundaries.",
                "They have no measurable effect on physiological arousal, only on behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural scripts from purity culture often frame women as 'gatekeepers' of morality, which internalizes the belief that experiencing or expressing desire is inherently 'bad' or 'un-virtuous,' leading to deep-seated shame."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "What is the primary neurobiological difference between 'Guilt' and 'Shame' as they relate to the inhibitory response?",
            "options": [
                "Guilt is related to behavior (I did something bad), while Shame is related to identity (I am bad).",
                "Shame activates the parasympathetic nervous system, while Guilt activates the sympathetic system.",
                "Guilt increases testosterone, while Shame increases estrogen.",
                "There is no neurobiological difference; they are used interchangeably in clinical settings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clinically, guilt is focused on a specific action and can be adaptive, whereas shame is a global evaluation of the self that triggers a more profound inhibitory response in the Sexual Inhibition System."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Masters and Johnson (1970) identified 'Spectatoring' as a major contributor to sexual dysfunction. Which of the following best describes this effect?",

                "Watching adult films to increase arousal levels.",
                "A partner 'watching' for signs of dissatisfaction in the other.",
                "A cognitive shift where an individual steps outside themselves to monitor their performance or appearance during sex.",
                "The use of mirrors in the bedroom to enhance visual stimulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spectatoring is the act of mentally 'stepping out' of the experience to judge one's body or performance, which shifts the brain from the sensory-focused parasympathetic state to an evaluative, anxious state."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which attachment style is most likely to use 'deactivating strategies,' such as pulling away or losing libido, when a partner seeks deeper emotional intimacy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with a Dismissive-Avoidant attachment style often perceive intimacy as a threat to their autonomy and use sexual withdrawal as a 'deactivating strategy' to maintain emotional distance."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Research on 'Sexual Perfectionism' indicates that socially prescribed perfectionism (the belief that others require you to be perfect) is most strongly correlated with:",
            "options": [
                "Increased frequency of sexual encounters.",
                "Higher levels of sexual self-esteem.",

                "Stronger communication between partners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Socially prescribed perfectionism creates an immense pressure to perform for the partner's approval, which triggers the SIS and significantly reduces satisfaction and arousal."

            "question": "In Narrative Reframing (Lesson 8), what is the purpose of 'Externalizing the Problem'?",
            "options": [
                "To blame the partner for the current libido issues.",
                "To view the 'Low Libido' as an outside entity rather than an inherent character flaw.",
                "To focus only on external stimuli rather than internal sensations.",
                "To identify external environmental factors like lighting and temperature."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalizing the problem helps the client separate their identity from the struggle (e.g., 'The Cloud of Low Desire' vs. 'I am broken'), which reduces shame and allows for a collaborative approach to solution-finding."

            "question": "Case Study: Mark experiences performance anxiety. He 'Mind Reads,' assuming his wife is disappointed if sex doesn't last 20 minutes. According to Lesson 7, what is the 'Spectatoring' loop Mark is likely trapped in?",
            "options": [
                "Arousal -> Focus on Pleasure -> Increased Arousal.",
                "Anxiety -> Self-Observation -> Physiological Inhibition -> Increased Anxiety.",
                "Boredom -> Distraction -> Loss of Erection -> Sleep.",
                "Excitement -> Performance -> Validation -> Secure Attachment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The anxiety leads to self-observation (spectatoring), which triggers the SIS (physiological inhibition), resulting in a loss of arousal, which then reinforces the initial anxiety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensate Focus is a gold-standard intervention that re-trains the brain to prioritize tactile sensations over visual self-evaluation, effectively breaking the spectatoring habit."
