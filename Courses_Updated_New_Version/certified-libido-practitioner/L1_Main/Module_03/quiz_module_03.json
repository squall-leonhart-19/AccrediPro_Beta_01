            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for processing internal bodily sensations (interoception) and is critical for the somatic connection to libido?",
            "options": [
                "The Insular Cortex",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex (or insula) is the primary hub for interoception, mapping internal states like heart rate and pelvic sensation into conscious awareness."

                "Sympathetic Activation (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown (Freeze)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state provides the sense of safety necessary for the body to transition into a state of arousal without triggering a threat response."

            "question": "In the initial phase of Sensate Focus (Masters & Johnson), what is the primary rule regarding genital touch and intercourse?",
            "options": [
                "Genital touch is encouraged but intercourse is banned",
                "Intercourse is allowed as long as it is brief",
                "Both genital touch and intercourse are strictly prohibited",
                "Only the partner with the lower libido is allowed to touch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To eliminate performance anxiety and 'spectatoring,' early Sensate Focus prohibits genital touch and intercourse, focusing entirely on non-genital sensory awareness."

            "options": [
                "By increasing cortisol levels to stimulate the heart",
                "The downward movement of the diaphragm creates a 'pumping' action that encourages pelvic vasocongestion",
                "It restricts blood flow to the extremities to prioritize the core",
                "It has no physical effect on blood flow, only a psychological effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing creates a pressure differential that acts as a pump, facilitating venous return and increasing blood flow to the pelvic region."

                "Hyper-arousal of the sympathetic nervous system",
                "Poor interoceptive awareness or somatic dissociation",
                "Excessive pelvic floor strength"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Numbness or disconnection indicates poor interoceptive awareness, where the brain suppresses sensory input from the body, often due to past stress or trauma."

                "Hypotonic (low tone/weak) pelvic floor",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A hypertonic pelvic floor remains in a state of chronic tension, which can lead to pain, reduced blood flow, and difficulty achieving the relaxation needed for orgasm."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5-4-3-2-1 technique is a grounding exercise that pulls a client out of 'spectatoring' (watching themselves) and back into their sensory experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic micro-dosing involves short (30-60 second) intervals of body awareness throughout the day to increase the brain's ability to process bodily signals."

            "explanation": "Interoceptive sensitivity (measured by heartbeat detection tasks) is positively correlated with higher subjective arousal and sexual satisfaction."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves introducing small, manageable amounts of stimulus to keep the client within their 'Window of Tolerance' without triggering a freeze response."
