            "question": "When performing an Advanced Clinical Assessment, which finding most strongly suggests a potential organic (medical) etiology for low libido rather than a purely psychogenic one?",
            "options": [
                "Desire fluctuates based on the level of conflict in the relationship",
                "Libido is low with a partner but remains high during solo masturbation",
                "A global loss of desire across all contexts, including a total absence of sexual dreams or solo urges",
                "The client reports 'feeling' desire but being unable to act on it due to stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A global loss of desire (including solo activity and nocturnal/dream-state arousal) is a clinical red flag for organic issues such as hormonal imbalances or neurological factors, whereas situational desire often points to psychogenic or relational causes."

            "question": "In the context of Narrative Therapy, what is the primary goal of 'Cognitive Deconstruction' regarding a client's libido?",
            "options": [
                "To identify and dismantle 'The Script'—the socially inherited and often unrealistic expectations of how desire should function",
                "To use repetitive affirmations to force the brain to feel more desire",
                "To erase all past memories of sexual trauma through hypnotic suggestion",
                "To teach the client to ignore their internal monologue during intimacy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Deconstruction involves identifying 'The Script'—the narrow, often shame-inducing social narratives about 'normal' desire—allowing the client to build a more authentic, personalized narrative."

            "question": "How does a Master Practitioner utilize 'Somatic Resonance' during a session?",
            "options": [
                "By performing manual muscle testing to check for testosterone levels",
                "By attuning to their own physiological sensations to gain non-verbal insight into the client's nervous system state",
                "By leading the client through high-intensity interval training to boost dopamine",
                "By using biofeedback machines to measure the client's heart rate variability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Resonance is the practitioner's ability to use their own body as a 'tuning fork' to sense the client's state of regulation or dysregulation, facilitating deeper empathy and diagnostic accuracy."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model applied in Precision Arousal Mapping, which of the following is often more predictive of sexual dysfunction than the strength of 'accelerators'?",
            "options": [
                "The client's age and BMI",
                "The frequency of sexual encounters per week",
                "The sensitivity and over-activation of the sexual 'brakes' (inhibition system)",
                "The partner's level of physical attractiveness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the sensitivity of the 'brakes' (the Sexual Inhibition System) is frequently a more significant factor in libido issues than the strength of the 'accelerators' (the Sexual Excitation System)."

            "id": "q24_5",

            "options": [
                "Encouraging the pursuer to pursue more aggressively to 'break' the distancer",
                "Focusing on the distancer's hormone levels exclusively",
                "Deconstructing the underlying asymmetry in needs for autonomy and intimacy within the 'Evolution' framework",
                "Advising the couple to take a complete break from all physical touch for six months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing the Pursuer-Distancer cycle requires looking at the relational system's balance of autonomy and intimacy, rather than just the individual's libido levels."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "The 'Evolution' Protocol suggests that shifting from 'Spontaneous' to 'Responsive' desire frameworks is:",
            "options": [
                "A sign of permanent clinical dysfunction that requires medication",
                "A natural and valid adaptation often seen in long-term relationships and certain neurobiological profiles",
                "Only applicable to female clients",
                "Something that can be 'cured' with enough cardiovascular exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Evolution Protocol normalizes Responsive Desire (arousal preceding desire) as a valid and functional biological adaptation, rather than a pathology to be fixed."

            "options": [
                "Immediately terminate the client relationship to avoid ethical breaches",
                "Disclose the feelings to the client to model 'Radical Honesty'",
                "Ignore the feelings entirely and push through the session",
                "Use the experience as diagnostic data to understand the client's relational field while maintaining strict professional boundaries"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners view countertransference as valuable 'field data' that provides insight into the client's interpersonal dynamics, provided it is managed through supervision and internal boundaries."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "In Integrated Case Formulation, which step must occur before implementing deep psychological deconstruction?",
            "options": [
                "The client must reach a specific hormonal blood level",
                "The practitioner must ensure 'Safety and Stabilization' of the client's nervous system",
                "The client must sign a contract promising to have sex twice a week",
                "The practitioner must complete a full 10-generation family tree"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multi-modal strategy dictates that a dysregulated nervous system cannot integrate deep psychological work; therefore, stabilization and safety are the clinical priorities."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "According to data discussed in the 'Evolution' Protocol (L6), approximately what percentage of women primarily experience 'Responsive' rather than 'Spontaneous' desire?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Exactly 25%",
                "Approximately 50-60%",
                "Nearly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical research (notably by Basson and others) suggests that roughly 50-60% of women (and many men) experience desire responsively, meaning it emerges after physical or emotional stimulation has begun."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Arousal Non-Concordance' (physical signs of arousal without subjective desire). What is the practitioner's first priority in Narrative Therapy?",
            "options": [
                "To explain that the body is 'lying' and the mind is always correct",
                "To normalize the phenomenon to reduce shame and the 'broken' narrative",
                "To prescribe stimulants to force the mind to catch up with the body",
                "To focus exclusively on genital stimulation until the mind agrees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Arousal Non-Concordance is a common biological reality. Normalizing it is the first step in deconstructing the shame-based narratives that often exacerbate libido issues."
