            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary shift in supervision is moving from a client-centered focus to a practitioner-centered focus, where the goal is to enhance the mentee's professional development and self-reflection."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vicarious Fragility involves a practitioner becoming overly protective of the client due to the practitioner's own discomfort or fear of re-traumatization, often resulting in the avoidance of effective but challenging interventions."
