            "question": "In the context of Neurodivergence (L1), a client with 'Sensory Avoidant' profiles may experience a libido 'shutdown' due to which specific phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine seeking behavior",
                "Tactile defensiveness or sensory overwhelm",
                "Hyperfocus on erotic stimuli",
                "Executive dysfunction in scheduling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory avoidant individuals often experience tactile defensiveness, where certain textures or types of touch become overstimulating or painful, leading to an immediate sympathetic nervous system 'fight or flight' response that inhibits libido."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Chronic Illness, what is the primary goal of the 'Pacing for Pleasure' protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the frequency of sexual encounters to 3 times per week",
                "To eliminate the use of all medications that affect libido",
                "To prevent Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) while maintaining intimacy",
                "To focus exclusively on penetrative intercourse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pacing for Pleasure is designed for clients with chronic fatigue or autoimmune conditions to ensure that intimate activity does not trigger a 'crash' or Post-Exertional Malaise by managing energy expenditure."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In Postpartum transitions (L3), which hormonal state is most responsible for the 'biological dampening' of libido and vaginal dryness in breastfeeding individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated Prolactin and suppressed Estrogen",
                "Low Progesterone and high Testosterone",
                "High Cortisol and high Oxytocin",
                "Suppressed Prolactin and high Estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High levels of Prolactin (necessary for milk production) actively suppress the HPG axis, leading to low Estrogen levels, which results in reduced libido and decreased vaginal lubrication."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "A Trauma-Informed Libido Coach (L4) notices a client 'spacing out' or becoming numb during a session. Which state of the Polyvagal hierarchy is the client likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Safety)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Collapse)",
                "Hyper-arousal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Numbness, dissociation, and 'spacing out' are classic signs of a Dorsal Vagal response, where the body shuts down to protect itself from perceived threat or overwhelm."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In High-Performance Athletes (L5), RED-S (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport) affects libido primarily by disrupting which mechanism?",

                "Over-hydration leading to electrolyte imbalance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S occurs when energy intake is insufficient for energy expenditure, causing the hypothalamus to stop the pulsatile release of GnRH, which shuts down reproductive hormone production and libido."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Research on Late-Life Intimacy (L6) suggests that 'Sexual Wisdom'—the ability to prioritize quality and emotional resonance over physical performance—tends to peak in which age range?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that while physical frequency may decrease, sexual satisfaction often remains stable or increases in the 60s-80s due to 'sexual wisdom' and better communication."

            "options": [
                "Decreased desire but increased lubrication",
                "Increased desire but localized vaginal/pelvic atrophy",
                "Total loss of libido within 3 months",
                "No change in desire but increased fertility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Testosterone therapy typically increases libido significantly, but the lack of estrogen can cause 'atrophic vaginitis' or tissue thinning, making the increased desire physically uncomfortable to act upon without intervention."

            "options": [
                "It is impossible to learn every fact about every culture",
                "Competency suggests an endpoint, while humility is an ongoing process of self-critique",
                "Humility is easier to bill for in a coaching practice",
                "Both A and B"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility acknowledges that a practitioner cannot know everything about a client's culture and requires an ongoing commitment to self-reflection and learning from the client as the expert of their own experience."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A client with ADHD reports they 'forget' they have a libido until they are in the middle of a sexual encounter. This is an example of which neurodivergent trait?",
            "options": [
                "Object Permanence issues applied to internal sensations",
                "Sensory seeking behavior",

                "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In neurodivergence, 'out of sight, out of mind' (object permanence) can apply to internal states. If the client isn't actively stimulated, they may lose 'access' to their libido until an external trigger occurs."

            "question": "Which intervention is most appropriate for a Perimenopausal client (L3) experiencing 'Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause' (GSM) affecting their libido?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Strict low-carb dieting",
                "Localized (topical) estrogen and high-quality lubricants",
                "Increasing caffeine intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GSM involves physical changes to the vulvovaginal tissues due to low estrogen. Localized estrogen and lubricants address the physiological pain/dryness, which is often the primary barrier to libido in this life stage."
