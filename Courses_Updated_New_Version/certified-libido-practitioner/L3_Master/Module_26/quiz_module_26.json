            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stabilization Phase focuses on down-regulating the sympathetic nervous system and reducing the 'inhibitory' signals that prevent desire from emerging."

                "Mild performance anxiety related to a new partner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sudden physical pain (dyspareunia) requires a medical evaluation to rule out physiological causes like infection, endometriosis, or hormonal shifts before coaching can proceed."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive training improves 'concordance,' the alignment between physical arousal signals and the brain's perception of that arousal, which is critical for desire."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Responsive desire requires the 'brakes' to be off and 'accelerants' to be applied through context and sensory engagement, rather than waiting for a spontaneous 'spark'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Planned novelty introduces neurochemical stimulation (dopamine) that mimics the early 'limerence' phase of a relationship, helping to re-ignite desire."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-connections and non-sexual touch are leading indicators because they build the foundation of safety and intimacy required for desire to emerge later."

            "question": "A client presents with 'Sexual Boredom' despite high relational satisfaction. Based on the Module 26 protocols, which intervention is most appropriate?",

            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule in maintenance suggests that focusing on a few critical 'levers'—usually sleep, stress, and relational context—maintains the majority of the libido gains."
