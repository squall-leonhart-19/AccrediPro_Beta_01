            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary distinction of a faith-based recovery assessment compared to a purely clinical assessment?",
            "options": [
                "It solely focuses on identifying spiritual deficits and sin.",
                "It integrates spiritual beliefs, practices, and resources as central and foundational to the client's recovery process.",
                "It replaces all medical and psychological evaluations with spiritual guidance and prayer.",
                "It is exclusively applicable to clients who identify with a specific religious denomination."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A faith-based assessment holistically integrates a client's spiritual beliefs, practices, and resources, recognizing their profound impact on the recovery journey, rather than focusing solely on deficits or replacing other forms of assessment."

                "Insist on immediate disclosure, explaining it's crucial for developing an effective recovery plan.",
                "Focus on building rapport and trust, validating the client's feelings, and creating a safe, non-judgmental space for future disclosure, while respecting their pace.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a trauma therapist and cease further intake until that therapy is complete.",
                "Document the refusal to share and move on to less sensitive topics, avoiding the issue entirely for the remainder of the coaching relationship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Building rapport and trust is paramount during initial intake, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like trauma. A coach should create a safe environment and allow the client to share at their own pace, rather than pressuring them or avoiding the issue."

            "question": "A client reports consistent daily prayer, active participation in their church community, and a strong belief in divine guidance. In a strengths-based assessment and resource mapping, how should a faith-based recovery coach categorize these elements?",

            "question": "A client expresses, 'I know my substance use is causing problems, and I sometimes think about quitting, but I'm not sure I'm ready to commit yet. I pray for strength, but it feels overwhelming.' According to the Stages of Change model, which stage does this most closely represent, and how might faith be leveraged?",
            "options": [
                "Precontemplation; the coach should focus on confronting the client with the severe consequences of their substance use.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client is aware of the problem and thinking about change but hasn't committed, which aligns with the Contemplation stage. In faith-based coaching, leveraging their spiritual desire for strength and hope can be a powerful motivational tool at this stage."

Which category of trigger does this specifically fall under, and what faith-based strategy might be most relevant for the recovery plan?",
            "options": [
                "External trigger; recommend avoiding specific places or people associated with these feelings.",
                "Social trigger; suggest changing friend groups to find more spiritually aligned individuals.",

            "explanation": "Ethical practice dictates that recovery coaches operate within their scope. Suicidal ideation and severe depression require professional mental health intervention. The coach's role is to ensure safety, facilitate appropriate referrals, and continue coaching within their defined boundaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spiritual abuse is a significant trauma that can impact recovery. A coach should acknowledge its impact, validate the client's experience, and refer to qualified professionals for trauma processing, while continuing to support the client within the coaching scope."
