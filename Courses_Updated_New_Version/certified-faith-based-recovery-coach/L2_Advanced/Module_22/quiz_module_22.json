            "question": "Which of the following best describes the unique ethical challenge in applying the principle of <span class=\"highlight\">beneficence</span> within a faith-based recovery coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the coach's spiritual beliefs align perfectly with the client's.",
                "Balancing the desire to promote spiritual growth with respecting client autonomy and their chosen path to well-being.",
                "Prioritizing spiritual interventions over evidence-based therapeutic methods, regardless of client preference.",
                "Avoiding any discussion of faith to maintain complete neutrality and prevent bias."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beneficence aims to do good, but in faith-based coaching, this must be balanced with respecting the client's autonomy and their self-determined path, even if it differs from the coach's preferred spiritual approach. Imposing beliefs or methods, even with good intentions, can violate autonomy."

            "question": "A faith-based recovery coach learns during a session that their client, a member of the same church, has expressed intent to harm a specific individual within the congregation. According to AccrediPro standards and common ethical guidelines, what is the coach's primary ethical obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain strict confidentiality, as the client is a church member and the confession was made in trust.",
                "Inform the church elders immediately to intervene spiritually and provide pastoral care to the client.",
                "Break confidentiality to warn the identified individual and/or contact appropriate authorities, as the duty to protect supersedes the duty to maintain confidentiality.",
                "Encourage the client to confess their intent to the church pastor during a private meeting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The duty to warn and protect an identifiable third party from imminent harm is a critical exception to confidentiality. Ethical guidelines consistently prioritize the safety of others over maintaining strict confidentiality in such severe circumstances."

            "question": "Coach Sarah is a worship leader at her church and also coaches a fellow congregant for recovery. This represents a <span class=\"highlight\">dual relationship</span>. Which ethical strategy is most appropriate for Sarah to manage this situation effectively, as discussed in Module 22 L3?",
            "options": [
                "Terminate the coaching relationship immediately to avoid any potential conflict of interest.",
                "Create clear boundaries, discuss the dual relationship during informed consent, maintain professional distance outside of coaching sessions, and seek regular supervision.",

                "Only discuss church-related matters during coaching sessions to strengthen their shared faith and avoid other personal topics."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While avoiding dual relationships is generally preferred, in faith-based communities, they can be unavoidable. The most ethical approach is to proactively manage them through clear boundaries, explicit discussion in informed consent, maintaining professional distance, and seeking supervision to ensure client welfare remains paramount."

            "options": [
                "A guarantee of spiritual transformation and complete recovery from addiction.",
                "A clear explanation of the spiritual framework, specific faith-based interventions, and the client's explicit agreement to their inclusion or exclusion.",
                "An assurance that the coach's spiritual beliefs and practices are identical to the client's.",
                "A waiver releasing the coach from all liability for any spiritual or recovery outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires transparency about the coaching process, including the integration of faith. Clients must understand what spiritual practices may be involved and have the autonomy to consent to or decline them. Guarantees are unethical, and waivers do not replace ethical responsibility."

            "question": "A client presents with severe, unmanaged symptoms of clinical depression alongside their substance use disorder, expressing suicidal ideation.

                "Intensify spiritual coaching and prayer to address the root spiritual issues causing the depression and suicidal thoughts.",
                "Provide crisis counseling and suggest specific medication recommendations based on the coach's personal experience.",

                "Advise the client to pray more, attend church services frequently, and trust in divine intervention for healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Severe mental health symptoms, especially suicidal ideation, are outside the scope of practice for a recovery coach.

            "options": [
                "Insist on using the standard materials, explaining their universal benefits and encouraging the client to be open-minded.",
                "Gently challenge the client's discomfort, suggesting it might be a form of resistance to the recovery process.",

                "Refer the client to a coach from their specific spiritual tradition, as David cannot effectively serve them."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural competence requires coaches to understand and respect diverse spiritual and cultural backgrounds. Adapting materials, exploring the client's specific needs, and seeking resources or supervision demonstrates a commitment to ethical and effective practice rather than imposing one's own framework or prematurely referring."

            "options": [
                "\"Providing faith-integrated support for lasting recovery from addiction.\"",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "When faced with an ethical dilemma, Module 22 L8 emphasizes a structured decision-making process. If a coach identifies a potential conflict between a client's desire for autonomy and the coach's perception of beneficence, which step in the ethical decision-making model should they prioritize next after identifying the dilemma and relevant ethical principles?",
            "options": [
                "Implement the first solution that comes to mind, as quick action is often best.",
                "Consult with peers, supervisors, or review relevant ethical guidelines and legal requirements.",
                "Inform the client that the coach's professional judgment is superior and will guide the decision.",
                "Document the dilemma and the chosen course of action only after the decision has been fully implemented."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "After identifying the core dilemma and relevant principles, the next critical step in ethical decision-making is to gather information, explore options, and seek consultation. This helps ensure a well-reasoned, ethically sound, and defensible decision."

            "options": [
                "Teach the client the coach's preferred prayer method, as it's proven effective in the coach's own experience.",
                "Dismiss the client's prayer preferences and focus solely on secular recovery strategies to avoid conflict.",
                "Explore the client's spiritual practices and preferences, respect their unique approach, and facilitate prayer in a way that aligns with the client's faith tradition and comfort level.",
                "Advise the client that prayer is not a recognized or evidence-based recovery tool and should not be relied upon."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical faith-based coaching respects client autonomy and their individual spiritual journey. The coach should adapt to the client's spiritual language and practices rather than imposing their own, facilitating an integrated approach that is meaningful and authentic for the client."

This statistic underscores the critical importance of which ethical principle?",
