            "question": "Which of the following best describes a primary distinction between traditional clinical supervision and faith-based mentoring in the context of recovery coaching, as discussed in L1?",
            "options": [
                "Faith-based mentoring explicitly integrates spiritual formation and theological reflection alongside professional development, while clinical supervision primarily focuses on clinical competence.",
                "Clinical supervision is always mandatory, whereas faith-based mentoring is optional and less structured.",
                "Faith-based mentoring does not require ethical guidelines, unlike clinical supervision.",
                "Traditional clinical supervision always involves a financial exchange, while faith-based mentoring is typically pro bono."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes that faith-based mentoring uniquely integrates spiritual formation, theological reflection, and the supervisee's personal faith journey into the supervisory process, alongside developing professional coaching competencies, which differentiates it from purely clinical models."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "A faith-based supervisor observes a supervisee consistently promoting a specific theological doctrine that is outside the agreed-upon ethical framework and scope of practice for the coaching organization, potentially alienating clients of other faiths. According to L3, what is the supervisor's immediate ethical responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately report the supervisee to the organizational ethics committee.",
                "To engage the supervisee in a confidential discussion about boundaries, ethical guidelines, and the potential impact on clients, offering corrective guidance.",
                "To advise the supervisee to only work with clients who share their specific theological views.",
                "To passively observe, assuming the supervisee will self-correct over time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 highlights the supervisor's responsibility to provide corrective guidance and uphold ethical boundaries. An immediate, confidential discussion is crucial to address the behavior, educate the supervisee, and prevent harm to clients, aligning with the principles of supportive and corrective supervision."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "During a case consultation (L4), a supervisee presents a client struggling with profound spiritual doubt and anger at God after a significant relapse. What reflective inquiry question would best facilitate the supervisee's understanding and response from a faith-based perspective?",
            "options": [
                "'How might the client's current spiritual struggle be an opportunity for deeper faith exploration, and what spiritual resources could you help them access?'",
                "'What are the immediate practical steps the client needs to take to prevent another relapse?'",
                "'Have you considered referring this client to a pastoral counselor instead?'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 emphasizes facilitating reflective practice that integrates spiritual dimensions. This question encourages the supervisee to consider the spiritual aspect of the client's experience not as a problem to be fixed, but as a path for growth, and to identify faith-based resources, aligning with a recovery coaching approach."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "A supervisee confides in their supervisor about developing strong romantic feelings for a client, expressing guilt and confusion. Based on L5's discussion of ethical and spiritual dilemmas, what is the supervisor's most critical initial step?",

                "Help the supervisee process their feelings and immediately guide them to terminate the coaching relationship with the client, referring the client appropriately.",
                "Suggest the supervisee pray about their feelings and continue the coaching relationship while maintaining strict boundaries.",
                "Advise the supervisee to explore their feelings in personal therapy before making any decisions.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 stresses that dual relationships, especially romantic ones, are strictly unethical and harmful.

                "Increasing their workload to distract from personal feelings.",
                "Engaging in regular personal spiritual disciplines (e.g., prayer, meditation, scripture study) and seeking peer supervision or a spiritual director.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 strongly emphasizes the critical role of personal spiritual disciplines, self-reflection, and seeking support (like peer supervision or a spiritual director) for supervisors to maintain their own spiritual growth, resilience, and prevent burnout, enabling them to serve effectively."

            "explanation": "Lesson 5 highlights that practicing outside one's area of competence or blurring professional roles (e.g., coach as spiritual director without proper training) is a significant ethical concern related to competence and acting within one's defined scope of practice."
