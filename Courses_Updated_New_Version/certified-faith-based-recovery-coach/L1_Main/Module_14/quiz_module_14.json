            "question": "Which of the following best describes a primary distinguishing characteristic of Faith-Based Recovery Coaching, as introduced in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "It exclusively uses medical interventions and pharmacological treatments.",
                "It integrates spiritual principles, practices, and a client's faith journey as core components of the recovery process.",
                "It focuses solely on behavioral modifications without addressing underlying spiritual or emotional beliefs.",
                "It requires coaches to be licensed therapists or ordained clergy members."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Faith-Based Recovery Coaching uniquely integrates spiritual principles and a client's faith journey into the recovery process, distinguishing it from secular approaches that may not address the spiritual dimension as a primary component."

            "question": "A client confides in their Faith-Based Recovery Coach that they are struggling with a relapse and asks the coach to pray with them, but also specifically requests that this information be kept secret from their spouse, who is also a mutual acquaintance from their shared church community. According to Lesson 2 on Ethical Practice, which ethical principle is most directly challenged, and what should the coach prioritize?",
            "options": [
                "Professional competence; the coach should immediately refer the client to a clinical therapist for all spiritual and recovery support.",
                "Confidentiality and dual relationships; the coach must uphold confidentiality while also addressing the potential complexities of the dual relationship and establishing clear professional boundaries.",
                "Client autonomy; the coach should prioritize the client's request for secrecy above all else to maintain trust.",
                "Beneficence; the coach should inform the spouse immediately to ensure the client receives comprehensive support from their family."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This scenario challenges both confidentiality and the avoidance of dual relationships. The coach's primary ethical responsibility is to uphold confidentiality while also transparently addressing the boundaries of the coaching relationship, especially concerning shared community ties, without breaching the initial confidence."

            "options": [
                "Spirituality is merely a superficial coping mechanism that distracts from the true biological and psychological roots of addiction.",
                "Spirituality is a foundational dimension of human existence that, when disordered, neglected, or misdirected, can significantly contribute to the development and persistence of addiction, and is crucial for sustained, meaningful recovery.",
                "Spiritual practices are only relevant for clients who identify with a specific, organized religious denomination.",
                "Addiction is primarily a moral failing, and spiritual intervention is solely about repentance and adherence to dogma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 emphasizes that a holistic, faith-based perspective views spirituality as a fundamental aspect of human well-being. Disconnection or distortion in this area can predispose individuals to addiction, and a re-engagement with healthy spirituality is essential for deep and lasting recovery."

            "question": "In the 'F - Foundation in Faith' stage of the F.A.I.T.H. Framework™ (Lesson 4), a coach is working with a client who expresses significant skepticism about organized religion but is open to exploring personal spiritual growth. What would be the most appropriate initial approach for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Insist on the client adopting specific religious rituals or doctrines to establish a proper faith foundation.",
                "Explore the client's existing values, beliefs, and understanding of purpose or meaning, gently introducing universal spiritual principles that resonate with their worldview.",
                "Focus solely on cognitive-behavioral techniques, deferring all spiritual discussions until the client explicitly requests them.",
                "Refer the client to a theological expert or religious leader for instruction before continuing any coaching discussions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'F - Foundation in Faith' stage is about meeting the client where they are spiritually.

According to the 'A - Acknowledge & Accept' stage of the F.A.I.T.H. Framework™ (Lessons 5 & 6), what is the coach's crucial role in helping Maria move forward?",
            "options": [
                "To minimize Maria's past actions to alleviate her guilt and prevent her from dwelling on them.",
                "To encourage Maria to solely focus on making immediate amends to everyone she has harmed as a prerequisite for self-acceptance.",
                "To guide Maria in distinguishing between healthy remorse and destructive shame, facilitating self-compassion, and helping her internalize the concepts of grace and divine forgiveness.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the 'Acknowledge & Accept' stage, it's vital to help clients differentiate between productive remorse and debilitating shame. The coach's role is to facilitate self-compassion and the acceptance of grace and forgiveness, which are central to moving past self-condemnation in a faith-based recovery context."

            "question": "During the initial client engagement and assessment (Lesson 7), a Faith-Based Recovery Coach observes clear signs of severe, untreated depression and expresses suicidal ideation in a client.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice dictates that coaches must recognize the limits of their scope. Severe mental health crises, especially suicidal ideation, require immediate referral to qualified mental health professionals. The coach's role shifts to supportive referral rather than direct intervention for clinical conditions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A reflective statement mirrors back the client's expressed feelings and meanings, often deepening understanding and encouraging further exploration. Option B accurately reflects both the client's internal conflict and emotional state, which is a core component of effective reflective listening."

This statistic primarily underscores the importance of:",

            "question": "A client expresses concern that their Faith-Based Recovery Coach, who attends the same church, might inadvertently share details of their coaching sessions with other church members during casual conversation. To uphold ethical practice and maintain client trust, as per Lesson 2, what should the coach do?",
            "options": [

            "explanation": "Maintaining confidentiality and managing dual relationships are critical. The coach must proactively address the client's concerns by clarifying confidentiality policies and inviting open dialogue, rather than dismissing the concern or suggesting the client change their church."

            "question": "During a coaching session, a client states, 'I know I need to change, but I just don't have the energy to start again. It feels hopeless.' Applying principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI) within a faith-based context, as discussed in Lesson 8, which coach response would be most effective?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This response utilizes MI techniques by reflecting the client's ambivalence ('caught between wanting to change and exhaustion') and then gently eliciting change talk by asking about 'small steps' and connecting it to a faith-based resource ('leaning on your faith for strength'). This respects client autonomy and fosters self-efficacy."
