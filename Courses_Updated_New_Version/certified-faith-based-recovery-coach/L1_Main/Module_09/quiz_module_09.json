            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "During a session, a client consistently deflects discussions about personal responsibility, attributing all challenges to 'God's will.' Applying principles from 'Navigating Acknowledgment & Acceptance' (L2), what is the most appropriate grace-based coaching response?",
            "options": [
                "Directly challenge their interpretation, explaining the concept of free will.",
                "Empathize with their perspective while gently exploring the potential for personal agency within their faith.",

                "Refer them to a theologian to correct their spiritual understanding."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A grace-based approach involves empathy and understanding, acknowledging the client's perspective first. Gently exploring personal agency within their faith framework allows for compassionate confrontation without being dismissive or judgmental, aligning with Motivational Interviewing principles discussed in L2."

            "question": "A client has identified a past hurt and expresses readiness to forgive the person involved. According to 'Facilitating Inner Work & Introspection' (L3), what is a crucial distinction the coach must help the client understand regarding forgiveness?",

                "Forgiveness always requires immediate reconciliation and resuming the relationship.",
                "Forgiveness is primarily about forgetting the offense to move on.",
                "Forgiveness is a process of releasing resentment and bitterness, which does not necessarily equate to reconciliation or condoning the offense.",
                "Forgiveness is a one-time event that, once declared, permanently resolves all associated pain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L3 emphasizes that forgiveness is an internal process of releasing the burden of resentment and bitterness, which is distinct from reconciliation. Reconciliation involves rebuilding trust and relationship, which may not always be possible or advisable, and it doesn't mean condoning the harm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L7 clearly defines the scope of practice for faith-based coaches. Diagnosing mental health conditions or advising on medical treatments, including medication, is outside this scope. The ethical responsibility is to recognize these boundaries and refer the client to appropriate licensed professionals."

This aligns with L1's guidance on integrating theological concepts into actionable, measurable spiritual goal setting."
