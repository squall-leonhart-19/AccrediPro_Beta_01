            "question": "A client shares, 'I feel so alone, like God has abandoned me in this struggle.' Which of the following is the BEST example of an active listening response from a faith-based recovery coach?",
            "options": [
                "\"Have you tried praying more often?\"",
                "\"It sounds like you're experiencing deep spiritual isolation and questioning your connection with God.\"",
                "\"Many people feel that way; just keep pushing through.\"",
                "\"Let's focus on practical steps instead of feelings.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active listening involves reflecting the client's feelings and the essence of their statement without judgment or offering immediate solutions. Option B accurately mirrors the client's emotional and spiritual state, demonstrating empathy and understanding."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "When establishing a client's 'Foundation in Faith,' a coach learns the client grew up in a strict religious environment that caused significant spiritual trauma. What is the most appropriate initial coaching approach?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately suggest they reconnect with their childhood faith community for support.",
                "Gently explore their current beliefs, experiences with faith, and any existing spiritual wounds without judgment.",
                "Advise them to set aside past trauma and focus on finding a new, more positive spiritual path.",
                "Refer them directly to a therapist, as spiritual trauma is outside the coach's scope."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The initial step is to understand the client's unique spiritual landscape, including past traumas, through gentle, non-judgmental exploration. While referral to a therapist might be necessary later for deep trauma processing, a coach can ethically explore how past spiritual experiences impact current beliefs and recovery within the coaching scope."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client consistently minimizes the negative consequences of their addiction, stating, 'It wasn't that bad, I can stop anytime.' According to the 'Acknowledge & Accept' principle, what is the coach's primary role in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Confront the client directly with evidence of their denial and the severity of their addiction.",
                "Gently reflect their statements and explore the 'gap' between their current reality and their stated goals, using powerful questions.",
                "Share personal stories of denial to help the client relate and open up.",
                "Shift focus to future goals, as dwelling on the past can be counterproductive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients struggling with denial, a coach's role is to facilitate self-discovery, not confrontation. Reflecting their statements and using powerful questions to explore the discrepancy between their words and observed reality (the 'gap') encourages personal insight and moves them towards acceptance, as highlighted in the 'Acknowledge & Accept' lesson."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "During the 'Inner Work & Introspection' phase, a client is guided to conduct a 'spiritual inventory.' What is the primary purpose of this inventory?",
            "options": [
                "To catalog all past wrongdoings and confess them to others for absolution.",
                "To identify character assets and defects, understand their origins, and discern patterns needing spiritual transformation.",
                "To create a list of spiritual practices they currently engage in to assess their devotion.",
                "To assign blame to external factors and past experiences that contributed to their struggles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A spiritual inventory is a systematic process of self-examination aimed at understanding one's spiritual strengths (assets) and weaknesses (defects), identifying patterns, and preparing for spiritual growth and transformation, rather than solely focusing on confession or external blame."

            "question": "The principle of 'Trust & Transformation' emphasizes both surrender to a Higher Power and taking inspired action. Which statement best illustrates the balance required?",
            "options": [
                "Surrender means passively waiting for divine intervention without personal effort.",
                "Transformation is solely achieved through human willpower; trust is secondary.",
                "Surrender involves releasing control to a Higher Power, while inspired action is the diligent, faith-guided effort aligned with divine will.",
                "Trust is only necessary when action has failed repeatedly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Trust & Transformation' lesson teaches that surrender is not passive resignation but an active yielding to a Higher Power. This surrender then empowers and guides the individual to take intentional, faith-driven actions that facilitate genuine transformation, demonstrating a synergistic relationship between trust and action."

            "question": "A coach is working with a client struggling with persistent feelings of hopelessness despite significant progress in other areas. According to the 'Hope & Healing' lesson, which strategy is most aligned with fostering sustained hope?",
            "options": [
                "Reminding the client of past failures to motivate them to avoid relapse.",
                "Focusing solely on spiritual platitudes without addressing practical challenges.",
                "Helping the client identify small, achievable spiritual and practical goals, celebrate progress, and connect with a supportive community.",
                "Insisting the client simply 'have more faith' without exploring underlying issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fostering sustained hope involves a holistic approach. As per the 'Hope & Healing' lesson, this includes setting realistic, achievable goals (both spiritual and practical), acknowledging and celebrating progress, and leveraging the power of community and connection, rather than relying on platitudes or focusing on past failures."

            "question": "A client asks their faith-based recovery coach to pray with them during a session. According to ethical guidelines for coaches, what is the most appropriate response?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately agree, as it aligns with faith-based coaching principles.",
                "Decline, stating that praying with clients is always outside the scope of coaching.",
                "Assess if it aligns with the client's goals, the coaching agreement, and the coach's comfort level and professional boundaries, discussing it transparently with the client.",
                "Offer to find a spiritual leader to pray with them instead."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While faith-based coaching integrates spirituality, the 'Ethical Practice' lesson emphasizes maintaining professional boundaries. A coach should assess the request against the coaching agreement, the client's best interest, and their own comfort/boundaries, engaging in transparent communication. It's not an automatic 'yes' or 'no' but a thoughtful, ethical decision."

            "question": "A faith-based recovery coach finds themselves feeling emotionally drained and experiencing compassion fatigue after several intense client sessions. What is the most critical immediate action for the coach, as emphasized in the self-care lesson?",
            "options": [
                "Take on more clients to distract from their own feelings.",
                "Ignore the feelings and push through, as clients' needs are paramount.",
                "Engage in personal spiritual practices, seek supervision, and ensure adequate rest and boundaries.",
                "Advise clients to take a break from coaching until the coach feels better."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Self-Care for the Faith-Based Coach' lesson stresses that neglecting self-care compromises a coach's effectiveness and well-being. The most critical immediate action is to actively engage in self-care strategies, including spiritual nourishment, seeking professional supervision, and reinforcing personal boundaries to prevent burnout and compassion fatigue."

            "question": "Sarah, a client, has completed her spiritual inventory ('I') and is now struggling to move into 'Trust & Transformation' ('T'), fearing that surrendering means losing control. What might be the coach's most effective strategy to support Sarah?",
            "options": [
                "Revisit the 'Acknowledge & Accept' phase to ensure she fully grasps the reality of her situation.",
                "Reframe surrender not as losing control, but as gaining freedom by aligning with a Higher Power's benevolent will, exploring past experiences of positive trust.",
                "Insist she simply needs to 'have faith' and push past her fears.",
                "Focus on developing a detailed action plan, minimizing the need for surrender."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's struggle highlights a common misconception about surrender. The most effective coaching strategy, drawing from the 'Trust & Transformation' lesson, is to reframe surrender as an empowering act of aligning with a benevolent Higher Power, rather than a loss of control. Exploring her past experiences of positive trust can also help build this understanding and bridge the gap to action."
