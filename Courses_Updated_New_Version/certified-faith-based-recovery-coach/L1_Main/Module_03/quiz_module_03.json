            "question": "A client, Sarah, expresses deep resentment towards her former business partner for a perceived betrayal.

                "Suggest Sarah distract herself from the feeling by focusing exclusively on positive affirmations and avoiding the topic."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A spiritual inventory requires a systematic approach to resentments. The initial step involves detailed identification: who is involved, what happened, and how it impacted the individual's life, emotions, and principles. This clarity is crucial for subsequent processing and release."

                "Forgiveness is a one-time event that automatically eradicates all emotional pain and requires immediate reconciliation.",

            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to suppress the fear and pretend it doesn't exist, as faith should eliminate all negative emotions.",
                "Advise the client to seek constant reassurance from others to alleviate the fear, making their emotional state dependent on external validation.",
                "Guide the client to surrender the fear to a Higher Power, meditate on divine presence and unwavering love, identify the underlying beliefs driving the fear, and explore actionable steps to build trust and security through faith.",
