            "question": "In the context of faith-based recovery, what is the foundational role of \"acknowledgment\"?",
            "options": [
                "Simply admitting a problem exists to avoid conflict.",
                "Recognizing and accepting the truth about one's behaviors, choices, and their consequences, often in light of divine truth.",
                "Publicly confessing every past mistake to gain approval.",
                "Blaming external circumstances for one's struggles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledgment, as discussed in L1, is about a profound, often spiritually informed, recognition of one's reality, including destructive patterns and their origins. It's more than a superficial admission; it's an honest confrontation with truth."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client consistently minimizes the severity of their gambling addiction, stating, \"It's just a hobby, I can stop anytime.\" Which common form of denial, as explored in L2, is this client primarily exhibiting?",
            "options": [
                "Simple denial",
                "Projection",
                "Rationalization",
                "Minimization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Minimization is a specific type of denial where the individual acknowledges the behavior but downplays its impact or severity. The client admits to gambling but diminishes its problematic nature and their control over it."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When identifying destructive patterns, a Faith-Based Recovery Coach helps a client connect their compulsive behaviors to specific negative outcomes. Which of the following is an example of an \"intangible consequence,\" as discussed in L3?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intangible consequences are those that are not physical or financial, but rather emotional, relational, or spiritual. The erosion of trust directly impacts relationships and is not a physical or monetary loss."

                "Acceptance is a one-time event, while acknowledgment is an ongoing process.",
                "Acknowledgment is intellectual recognition, while acceptance involves emotional and spiritual surrender to reality without necessarily liking it.",
                "Acknowledgment focuses on the past, while acceptance only looks to the future.",
                "Acceptance requires forgetting past mistakes, while acknowledgment requires remembering them."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L4 emphasizes that acknowledgment is the cognitive recognition of truth, while acceptance is a deeper, holistic surrender to that truth, embracing reality with willingness, even if it's painful, and aligning one's heart and spirit with it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L5 clarifies that self-forgiveness is not about condoning actions but about releasing the burden of guilt and shame that can impede recovery. It's a crucial step in accepting divine grace and moving forward in healing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L6 stresses that acknowledging impact on others is crucial. Making amends should be genuine, empathetic, and constructive, focusing on repairing relationships and taking responsibility without falling into enabling patterns or superficial gestures like buying gifts."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A client states, \"I only drink on weekends, and it helps me relax. My wife just overreacts.\" This statement, reflecting concepts from L2 and L3, demonstrates elements of both denial and a destructive pattern. Which two concepts are most evident here?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client is minimizing the problem ('only drink on weekends', 'helps me relax') and rationalizing their behavior. They are also projecting blame onto their wife ('overreacts'), which is a form of denial and externalizing responsibility."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
