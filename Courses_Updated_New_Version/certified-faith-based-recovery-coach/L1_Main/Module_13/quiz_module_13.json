            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Faith-Based Recovery Coaches operate within a specific scope, focusing on support, guidance, and accountability related to recovery and spiritual growth.

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L2 emphasizes understanding addiction through a spiritual lens, often identifying it as a 'spiritual void' or a search for meaning that addiction attempts to fill, rather than solely a biological or moral issue. While other factors contribute, the spiritual lens highlights this core aspect."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L4 emphasizes meeting the client where they are, helping them explore their spiritual history and current beliefs without judgment.

My family expects me to be 'fixed' now that I'm sober, and I don't know how to tell them I'm still struggling.' The coach responds, 'It sounds like you're feeling a heavy burden of expectation from your family, and you're wrestling with how to communicate your ongoing challenges while maintaining your recovery momentum.'

            "explanation": "L7 emphasizes applying SMART goal-setting principles to recovery and spiritual goals. While the desire to 'deepen connection with God' is valid, making it SMART (e.g., 'I will spend 15 minutes daily in scripture reading for the next month') provides clarity and actionable steps."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L8, a coaching agreement is crucial for building trust and clarity.

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L7 emphasizes challenging limiting beliefs within a supportive and non-judgmental framework.
