        {
            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "In Advanced Geometric Gridding (L1), which structure is known as the 'Vector Equilibrium' and represents a state where all forces are equal and balanced?",
            "options": ["The Icosahedron", "The Cuboctahedron", "Metatron's Cube", "The Star Tetrahedron"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cuboctahedron is the 'Vector Equilibrium,' a term coined by Buckminster Fuller, representing the zero-point where all vectors are of equal length and angular relationship."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "During a Bio-Field Scanning session (L2), a practitioner detects a 'dense, static-like' sensation in the mental body layer. This typically indicates:",
            "options": ["A physical injury in the musculoskeletal system", "An overactive emotional response", "Cyclical thought patterns or cognitive congestion", "A spiritual awakening or crown chakra opening"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Density or 'static' in the mental body layer (the third layer of the bio-field) is a clinical indicator of cognitive congestion or repetitive, unproductive thought patterns."
        },

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Crystalline Alchemy, which trace element is responsible for the calming, anti-anxiety properties found in Lepidolite and Lithium Quartz?",
            "options": ["Manganese", "Iron", "Lithium", "Titanium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lithium is a trace element used in modern pharmacology for mood stabilization; in crystal healing, stones containing lithium are used for their natural ability to soothe the nervous system."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "In the 'Transmutation Protocol' (L5), why is it critical to use a 'Bridge Stone' like Danburite when working with deep shadow release stones like Obsidian?",
            "options": ["To increase the physical weight of the layout", "To prevent the client from falling asleep", "To facilitate the integration of high-frequency light into the released emotional space", "To speed up the chemical reaction of the crystals"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-vibration 'Bridge Stones' ensure that as dense emotions are released (transmuted), the void is filled with higher-frequency light to prevent energetic collapse."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Non-Local Healing.' Which quantum physics principle explains why a crystal grid in a practitioner's office can influence a client thousands of miles away?",
            "options": ["Thermodynamics", "Quantum Entanglement", "The Doppler Effect", "Centripetal Force"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Quantum Entanglement suggests that particles that have interacted remain connected, such that the state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™ (L8), what does the 'E' stand for in the clinical application sequence?",
            "options": ["Evaluation", "Evolution", "Entrainment", "Extraction"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'E' stands for Entrainment, which is the process of the client's weaker or chaotic frequency syncing with the stable, dominant frequency of the crystal."

        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "Which crystal lattice system is characterized by three unequal axes and one oblique intersection, making it ideal for 'shifting' stubborn energy (L4)?",
            "options": ["Cubic", "Hexagonal", "Monoclinic", "Triclinic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Monoclinic system (found in Selenite and Kunzite) has an asymmetrical structure that is clinically used for movement, flow, and shifting stagnant patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "When performing 'Advanced Auric Sealing' (L6), the 'Golden Thread' technique is primarily used to:",
            "options": ["Cleanse the chakras", "Repair 'tears' or 'leaks' in the outer boundary of the aura", "Connect the client to their ancestors", "Increase the client's physical strength"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Golden Thread technique is a visualization and tool-based protocol used to 'stitch' and seal leaks in the auric field that may cause energy depletion."

            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "In Multidimensional Space Holding (L3), what is the primary purpose of the 'Ritual Container'?",
            "options": ["To hold the crystals during the session", "To provide a physical barrier against noise", "To maintain a high-frequency resonance and protect the energetic integrity of the session", "To serve as a decorative element for the client's comfort"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Container is an energetic boundary established by the practitioner to ensure that the healing space remains 'pure' and free from external vibrational interference."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "A client experiences 'vibrational vertigo' (dizziness) after an advanced 5D attunement. Which clinical action should the practitioner take immediately (L8)?",
            "options": ["Place more high-vibration stones on the Crown chakra", "Apply grounding stones like Smoky Quartz to the feet and Black Tourmaline in the palms", "End the session immediately and ask them to leave", "Give them a high-sugar snack"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vibrational vertigo is a sign of being ungrounded. Using heavy, iron-bearing or dark stones at the feet and extremities helps pull the energy back into the physical body (Stabilization)."
