                "The moment a crystal is cleared of all previous programming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 teaches that high-frequency stones often require 'anchoring' minerals to prevent the client from 'floating' or experiencing an unmanageable transmutation peak."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "A client experiences a sudden 'Transmutation Peak' (T) characterized by rapid breathing and emotional release. What is the practitioner's first priority according to Lesson 6?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Navigating the Transmutation Peak requires the practitioner to hold space and use 'bridge' techniques to ensure the release is productive rather than traumatic."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The stabilization phase notes that the bio-field requires 48 to 72 hours to fully calibrate and 'set' the new frequency patterns established during the session."
