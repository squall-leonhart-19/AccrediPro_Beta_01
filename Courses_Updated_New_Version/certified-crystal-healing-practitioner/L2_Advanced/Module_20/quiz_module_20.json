            "question": "What is the primary objective of 'Energetic Anamnesis' during the advanced client intake process?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose specific medical conditions as defined by the DSM-5",
                "To map the client's historical timeline of emotional and energetic trauma to identify root 'imprints'",
                "To determine which crystals the client finds most aesthetically pleasing",
                "To perform a physical examination of the musculoskeletal system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic Anamnesis goes beyond medical history to identify the 'energetic origin' of current imbalances by mapping trauma timelines and vibrational imprints."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "During Bio-Field Scanning, a practitioner experiences a 'cool, breezy' sensation over a client's Heart Chakra. This tactile feedback typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Acute inflammation or overactivity",
                "A healthy, balanced energy flow",
                "Energy depletion, a 'void,' or an underactive state",
                "The presence of a high-frequency spiritual guide"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In bio-field scanning, heat usually indicates congestion or overactivity, while coolness or a 'draft' sensation indicates depletion or a lack of vitality in that area."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In Precision Dowsing, what is the 'Search Position' used for before a specific query is made?",
            "options": [
                "To clear the pendulum of previous energies",
                "To establish a neutral, 'ready' state where the practitioner remains unattached to the outcome",
                "To indicate a 'No' response automatically",
                "To measure the diameter of the client's aura"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Search Position is a neutral state (often a slight forward/back oscillation or stillness) that signals the practitioner is ready to receive data without bias."

            "question": "When using Applied Kinesiology (AK) for Mineral Resonance Testing, a 'weak' or 'breaking' muscle response to a specific crystal suggests:",
            "options": [
                "The crystal is highly beneficial and the body is relaxing",
                "The crystal's frequency is currently creating a stress response or 'incompatibility' in the client's bio-field",
                "The client needs to exercise more to strengthen their muscles",
                "The crystal is 100% authentic and high-grade"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In AK, a muscle that 'breaks' or weakens indicates that the stimulus (the crystal) is causing a neurological stress response or is not resonant with the system at that time."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A practitioner observes a 'muddy brown' or 'grayish' hue in the emotional layer of a client's aura. According to Visual Diagnostic protocols, this most likely represents:",

                "Physical vitality and athletic prowess",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Muddy or gray tones in the auric field are clinical indicators of stagnation, toxicity, or unresolved emotional 'sludge' that requires clearing."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "When mapping chakras with a pendulum, a wide, aggressive clockwise circle (larger than 6 inches in diameter) is interpreted as:",
            "options": [
                "A perfectly balanced chakra",
                "A closed or blocked chakra",
                "An overactive or hyper-functioning chakra often compensating for other areas",
                "A chakra that has been completely 'blown out' and non-functional"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While clockwise is the standard healthy spin for most, excessive width and speed indicate hyper-activity, where the chakra is over-processing energy, often due to stress or compensation."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Which sensation is most commonly associated with a 'Conductivity Blockage' when scanning a Meridian pathway?",

                "A feeling of 'slippery' or 'oily' energy",
                "A 'magnetic push' or sense of resistance, as if pushing against two like-poles of a magnet",
                "A total absence of any sensation whatsoever",
                "A pleasant tingling sensation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meridian blockages often manifest as 'static' or 'magnetic resistance,' where the practitioner's hand feels pushed away from the body's surface."

            "id": "q20_8",

            "options": [
                "Bill the client for the session",
                "Synthesize data from scanning, dowsing, and intake to identify the 'Root Resonance Issue' and plan the intervention",
                "Provide a map of the client's home for crystal placement",
                "Record the client's zodiac sign and birthstone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vibrational Blueprint is the 'master plan' that integrates all assessment data to ensure the healing session targets the root cause rather than just symptoms."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic lower back pain and financial anxiety. During assessment, the pendulum shows a tight, erratic counter-clockwise spin at the Root Chakra. This is a classic sign of:",
            "options": [
                "Root Chakra Congestion and Maladaptive Spin",
                "Root Chakra Depletion",
                "An overactive Crown Chakra",
                "A healthy Root Chakra response to stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Counter-clockwise movement in a chakra traditionally spinning clockwise indicates a 'maladaptive' spin or congestion, where energy is being expelled or blocked rather than integrated."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Scientific research into the 'Ideomotor Effect' explains that pendulum movement is caused by:",

                "Geopathic stress lines in the earth",
                "The gravitational pull of the minerals in the room",
                "Unconscious micro-muscular movements triggered by the practitioner's subconscious processing of information",
                "Static electricity built up on the practitioner's skin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ideomotor effect is the scientifically recognized phenomenon where subconscious thoughts or processing trigger minute muscle movements that are amplified by the pendulum."
