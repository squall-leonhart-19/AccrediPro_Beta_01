            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Feeling fragmented and overly sensitive to external environments is a hallmark of Auric Boundary Permeability, requiring protective and shielding stones like Black Tourmaline or Hematite."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When formulating an 'Energetic Hypothesis' (L2), how is a condition characterized by 'inflammation, racing thoughts, and irritability' categorized?",

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, which crystal lattice system is scientifically most effective for a client needing 'reorganization of chaotic life patterns' due to its highly symmetrical, four-fold symmetry?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clearing or De-programming must occur first to remove stagnant or dissonant frequencies, ensuring the client's field is receptive to the new 'Charging' frequencies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "Within the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™ (L6), the 'Assess' phase specifically requires the practitioner to do what?",

                "Choose the crystals for the layout",
                "Perform a multi-point energetic scan to validate the intake findings",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Assess' phase involves validating the Vibrational Interview through physical or energetic scanning (pendulum, hands, or intuition) to confirm the energetic hypothesis."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with a 'Chronic' condition (L7) involving 5 years of low thyroid function. What is the recommended treatment duration and frequency strategy?",
            "options": [

                "Short, high-frequency bursts every hour for one day",
                "Low-frequency, long-duration exposure (e.g., 28-day grid or daily wear)",
                "A single clearing session with Selenite"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic conditions require 'Low-frequency, long-duration' interventions to gently coax the body's vibration back to baseline without causing an 'healing crisis' or energetic shock."

            "id": "q21_8",

            "options": [
                "The client is in total energetic alignment",
                "The client is below the healthy neutral point (5) and requires further intervention",
                "The crystals have been overcharged",
                "The treatment plan is complete"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "On the VBS (1-10 scale), 5 is the neutral baseline. A score of 4 indicates the client is still slightly deficient or stagnant and requires continued support."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Why does Lesson 3 emphasize the chemical composition of 'Silicates' for professional-grade amplification?",

                "They contain higher levels of calcium for bone healing",
                "They are naturally more colorful than carbonates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Silicates (like Quartz) possess piezoelectric properties, meaning they convert mechanical pressure into electrical frequency, making them the most reliable amplifiers in treatment planning."

            "question": "In the 'Stabilization' phase of the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™ (L6/L8), what is the primary goal for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "To sell the client more crystals",
                "To ensure the energetic shifts 'lock in' and do not revert to old patterns",
                "To clear the room for the next client",
                "To change the energetic hypothesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization is the final step where the practitioner uses specific grounding and sealing techniques to ensure the new vibrational state becomes the client's permanent baseline."
