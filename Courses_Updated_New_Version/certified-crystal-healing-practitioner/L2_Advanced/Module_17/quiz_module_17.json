            "question": "When navigating multi-layered energetic blockages (L1), what is the primary risk of using high-vibration 'reset' stones like Moldavite immediately?",
            "options": [
                "It may cause a 'healing crisis' by forcing the release of layers the client is not yet ready to process.",
                "It will permanently seal the blockage making it impossible to clear later.",
                "It will turn the stones into 'dead' minerals that cannot be recharged.",
                "It has no risk and is the recommended first step for all complex cases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, 'peeling the onion' is necessary. Aggressive high-vibration stones can trigger a healing crisis or overwhelm the client's nervous system before they have the grounding to handle the release."

            "question": "For a client with PTSD experiencing active dissociation (L2), which crystal placement protocol is considered the most 'Trauma-Informed'?",
            "options": [
                "Placing Herkimer Diamonds on the Third Eye to induce visions.",
                "Placing Selenite wands above the head to open the Soul Star chakra.",
                "Heavy grounding with Black Tourmaline or Hematite at the feet and palms.",
                "Using a large Amethyst cluster on the chest to 'force' emotional release."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care prioritizes safety and stabilization. For dissociation, the goal is to bring the client back into their body using grounding stones at the lower extremities."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, 'Energetic Armor' in resistant clients is described as a protective mechanism. What is the most effective way to 'break through' this armor?",
            "options": [
                "Using a laser-point Quartz to pierce the auric field with force.",
                "Using gentle, 'invitational' stones like Rose Quartz or Green Calcite to soften the field.",
                "Increasing the volume of the session music to bypass the ego.",
                "Telling the client they are being difficult so they consciously stop resisting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance is often a subconscious safety response. Softening the 'armor' with heart-centered, gentle minerals allows the client's system to relax and accept the healing energy without feeling attacked."

            "question": "According to the 'Bio-Mineral Approach' for autoimmune support (L4), why is Fluorite specifically utilized for chronic illness?",
            "options": [
                "Because it contains high amounts of Vitamin C.",
                "Due to its highly structured cubic or octahedral geometry which supports 'energetic blueprint' organization.",
                "Because it is the only stone that can cure autoimmune diseases.",
                "It is used primarily for its ability to change color in the sun."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluorite's highly organized geometric structure is used in bio-mineral protocols to provide a 'blueprint' for cellular order, which is often chaotic in autoimmune conditions."

                "Red Jasper"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phenacite is an extremely high-vibration stone that stimulates the upper chakras. In a spiritual crisis where energy is already over-active in the head, this can worsen symptoms like vertigo or psychosis."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Using the smallest stones possible so they can be hidden in pockets.",
                "Using only raw, sharp-edged crystals for maximum energy.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount with children. Tumbled stones prevent scratches, and larger sizes (larger than a 35mm film canister) prevent accidental choking or ingestion."

            "question": "In complex distance healing (L8), what is the function of the 'Witness' or 'Proxy' in a remote grid?",
            "options": [
                "It serves as the 'battery' that powers the grid.",
                "It represents the client's specific energetic signature, allowing the crystals to 'target' the remote location.",
                "It is a stone that the practitioner looks at to stay awake.",
                "It is used to absorb any 'bad luck' from the practitioner."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Witness (often a photo, name on paper, or a specific crystal like a Clear Quartz point) acts as the 'anchor' for the client's energy within the practitioner's workspace."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Rule' for spiritual crisis is that high-intensity spiritual energy must be anchored in the physical body to prevent psychological and energetic fragmentation."
