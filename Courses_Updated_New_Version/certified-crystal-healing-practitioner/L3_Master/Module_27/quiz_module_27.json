            "question": "In a fertility support protocol, why might a practitioner choose Moonstone over Malachite for a client with a history of emotional sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "Moonstone is physically harder and more durable for daily wear",
                "Malachite's high copper content makes it toxic to touch during ovulation",
                "Moonstone regulates the endocrine system gently, while Malachite can trigger intense emotional purging",
                "Malachite is only effective when used in direct sunlight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Moonstone provides gentle hormonal and emotional regulation (the 'Lunar' energy), whereas Malachite is an 'amplifier' that can cause rapid, sometimes overwhelming emotional release which may be counterproductive for sensitive fertility clients."

                "Inside a desk drawer to keep the energy contained"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For EMF mitigation in workspace optimization, Shungite should be placed between the source of radiation and the individual to create an effective energetic buffer zone."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In Quantum Entanglement protocols for remote healing, what is the purpose of the 'Witness' or 'Surrogate'?",
            "options": [
                "To serve as a legal witness that the session took place",
                "To act as a physical anchor and focal point for the client's energetic signature",
                "To absorb any 'negative' energy sent back from the client",
                "To provide a surface for the practitioner to rest their hands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Witness' (often a photo, name on paper, or a crystal) acts as a surrogate that holds the client's unique vibrational signature, allowing for the non-local transfer of energy via quantum entanglement."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "A Trauma-Informed practitioner observes a client entering a 'freeze' state (dissociation). Which action is most consistent with nervous system regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Placing a high-vibration Selenite wand on the Crown Chakra to 'lift' them out",
                "Increasing the intensity of the crystal energy to break the freeze",
                "Using 'Titration' by introducing a grounding stone like Smoky Quartz at the feet and encouraging sensory awareness",
                "Ending the session immediately without further contact"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed practice uses 'titration'—introducing small amounts of grounding energy to help the client safely reintegrate into their body without overwhelming the nervous system."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Why is the 'Indirect Method' (placing crystals outside a glass container) mandatory when creating a Gem Elixir with Selenite or Malachite?",
            "options": [
                "Because direct contact with water makes the crystals lose their color",
                "Because Selenite is water-soluble and Malachite contains toxic copper levels",
                "Because the crystals need to be kept dry to maintain their magnetic charge",
                "Because the water will evaporate too quickly if the crystals are submerged"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount in vibrational medicine; Selenite will dissolve in water, and Malachite can leach toxic copper. The indirect method ensures the water receives the vibration without chemical contamination."

                "The charging of crystals under a full moon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is a principle of physics where the body's erratic or 'out of tune' frequencies synchronize with the stable, geometric vibrations of crystals or specific sound frequencies."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Which sound frequency is scientifically associated with the 'Solfeggio' scale for DNA repair and is often paired with Rose Quartz in heart-centered protocols?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "528 Hz is known as the 'Miracle' frequency or the frequency of transformation/DNA repair, and it harmonizes perfectly with the heart-healing properties of Rose Quartz."
