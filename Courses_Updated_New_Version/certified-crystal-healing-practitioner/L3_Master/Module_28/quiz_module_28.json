            "question": "During an 'Energetic Triage' situation where a client begins to hyperventilate or experience a panic attack, which crystal protocol is most appropriate for immediate stabilization?",
            "options": [
                "Placing High-Vibration Clear Quartz on the Crown Chakra to clear the mind",
                "Using large pieces of Black Tourmaline or Smoky Quartz at the feet and palms to ground the energy",
                "Applying Selenite to the Third Eye to induce a spiritual vision",
                "Using Moldavite on the Heart Chakra to force an emotional release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In triage, the priority is stabilization and grounding. Black Tourmaline and Smoky Quartz help pull excess, frantic energy down from the upper chakras and ground the client into their physical body."

            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Crystal Healing, why are high-vibration tektites like Moldavite or Libyan Desert Glass often contraindicated for clients with active PTSD?",
            "options": [
                "They are too physically heavy for the client to hold",
                "They can trigger 'flooding' or rapid emotional processing that exceeds the client's Window of Tolerance",
                "They have no effect on the nervous system",
                "They are only effective when used in sunlight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-vibration stones can accelerate energetic shifts too quickly for a traumatized nervous system to integrate, potentially leading to retraumatization or 'flooding' where the client is overwhelmed by emotions."

            "question": "A client is in the 'Acute Shock' phase of grief after a sudden loss. Which stone is specifically recommended for its ability to 'absorb' the heaviness of grief without reflecting it back?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hematite is highly effective for chronic pain due to its high iron content and cooling energy, which helps ground the sensation of pain and reduce the energetic 'heat' associated with inflammation."
