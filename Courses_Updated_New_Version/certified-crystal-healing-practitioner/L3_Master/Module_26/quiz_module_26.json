            "options": [
                "Programs focus on immediate symptom relief only",
                "Programs utilize longitudinal frequency mapping to track energetic evolution over time",
                "Programs are strictly for group settings while sessions are for individuals",
                "Programs use fewer crystals to avoid overwhelming the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A program is defined by its longitudinal approach, moving beyond 'one-off' fixes to map and guide a client's energetic evolution over a sustained period."

            "options": [
                "To make the session more expensive",
                "To ensure the 'energetic vessel' is free of stagnant debris that could cause a healing crisis when high frequencies are introduced",
                "Because high-frequency stones do not work on ungrounded clients",
                "To test if the client is allergic to crystals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clearing the vessel ensures that high-vibration energy can be integrated smoothly without being blocked by or reacting violently to stagnant 'sludge' in the biofield."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the program",
                "Increase the vibration of the crystals to push through",
                "Implement the 'Stabilization Protocol' using grounding stones and nervous system regulation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 24-72 hour window is critical for the subtle bodies to recalibrate and 'lock in' the new frequency patterns established during the session."

                "To charge all the crystals at once in a microwave",
                "To create a central energetic anchor that links and stabilizes the individual grids of all participants",
                "To track the financial profits of the program",
                "To store the crystals when not in use"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
