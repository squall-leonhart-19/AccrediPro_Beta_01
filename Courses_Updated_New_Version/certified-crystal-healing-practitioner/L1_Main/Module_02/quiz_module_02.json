            "question": "Within the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™, what is the primary objective of the 'Attunement' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To physically clean the crystals with soap and water",
                "To establish a coherent resonance between the practitioner, the crystal tools, and the client's bio-field",
                "To diagnose specific medical conditions using crystal pendulums",
                "To memorize the chemical composition of the stones being used"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attunement is about synchronizing the energetic frequencies of the practitioner, the tools, and the client to create a unified healing field."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "During 'Environmental Sanctification' (L2), what is the scientific rationale for using salt lamps or certain smudge resins?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the presence of positive ions which stimulate the brain",
                "They create a vacuum that physically sucks dust out of the air",
                "They facilitate the release of negative ions, which helps neutralize 'energetic static' and improves mood",
                "They have no scientific basis and are purely for aesthetic purposes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environmental sanctification often utilizes tools that generate negative ions, which counteract the 'static' or 'heavy' energy (positive ions) found in stagnant or electronically saturated spaces."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Self-Attunement Protocols' (L3), what physiological state is most desirable for a practitioner before beginning a session?",
            "options": [
                "High-beta brainwave state for intense analytical focus",
                "Heart-Brain Coherence, characterized by a smooth, rhythmic Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "A state of 'Sympathetic Dominance' to ensure high energy levels",
                "Complete sensory deprivation to avoid distraction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart-Brain Coherence allows the practitioner to act as a stable 'tuning fork' for the client, facilitating a more effective energetic exchange."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "When performing 'Bio-Field Smoothing' (L4), a practitioner feels a 'magnetic push' or 'density' several inches above the client's body. This 'hitch' typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The client is wearing hidden metal jewelry",
                "An area of energetic congestion or emotional stagnation in the aura",
                "That the practitioner is pressing too hard on the air",
                "The session is already complete and should be terminated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensitizing the hands to feel 'hitches' or 'voids' allows the practitioner to identify where the bio-field requires smoothing or clearing before stones are placed."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Programming the Healing Field.' What is the 'Carrier Wave' that transmits the practitioner's intention into the crystal's lattice?",
            "options": [
                "Physical heat from the hands",
                "Coherent emotion coupled with focused mental visualization",
                "The sound of the practitioner's voice",
                "The ambient light in the room"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™, intention is most effectively 'carried' by the combination of a clear mental thought (the data) and a coherent emotional state (the power)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "528 Hz is frequently used in attunement protocols to sanctify the space and promote deep cellular resonance and transformation."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "In 'Energetic Architecture' (L7), what is the primary purpose of a 'Perimeter Grid' in the healing room?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the client from leaving the table",
                "To create a contained 'container' of high-vibrational energy and block external interference",
                "To provide a decorative border for the treatment area",
                "To increase the room's temperature through crystal radiation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gridding the room creates a 'sacred geometry' container that stabilizes the energy and prevents outside 'noise' from disrupting the session."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A practitioner notices the client's breathing shifts from shallow chest breathing to deep abdominal breathing. According to Lesson 8, this is a sign of:",
            "options": [
                "The client falling asleep and becoming unresponsive",
                "The 'Shift'—indicating the client's nervous system has transitioned into a receptive parasympathetic state",
                "An allergic reaction to the incense or oils used",
                "The practitioner needing to increase the intensity of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Shift' is a physical and energetic indicator that the attunement has been successful and the client's field is now receptive to the crystal work."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "If a practitioner feels 'ungrounded' or 'floaty' during the attunement process, which tool from Lesson 6 is most appropriate to use for rapid re-centering?",
            "options": [
                "A high-frequency tuning fork (e.g., 4096 Hz)",
                "A deep-toned Tibetan singing bowl or grounding scent like Vetiver",
                "Bright white LED lights",
                "High-vibration crystals like Selenite or Phenacite"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lower frequencies (sound) and earthy, root-based scents (scent) are the most effective tools for pulling a practitioner's energy back into a grounded, centered state."

                "One (under the table)",
                "Two (head and foot)",
                "Four (creating a rectangular boundary)",
                "Twelve (representing the zodiac)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While grids can be complex, the foundational 'Stability Grid' described in Lesson 7 uses four anchor points at the corners of the treatment area to define the sacred space."
