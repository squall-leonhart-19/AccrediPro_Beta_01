            "question": "In the FACETS Method™, how is 'Transmutation' specifically distinguished from 'Cleansing'?",
            "options": [
                "Cleansing removes surface debris, while Transmutation changes the chemical composition of the crystal.",
                "Cleansing removes external energetic 'dust,' whereas Transmutation converts the internal frequency of a stagnant pattern into a higher vibrational state.",
                "Transmutation is only used for physical ailments, while Cleansing is for emotional issues.",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in the FACETS framework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cleansing (C) focuses on removing non-resonant energies from the field, while Transmutation (T) is the active process of converting low-frequency or stagnant energy into a functional, high-vibrational state."

            "question": "The principle of 'Entrainment,' foundational to Module 5, was first scientifically observed by Christian Huygens in 1665 using what objects?",
            "options": [
                "Quartz oscillators",
                "Magnetic compasses",
                "Pendulum clocks",
                "Tuning forks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Huygens discovered that two pendulum clocks hanging from the same beam would eventually swing in perfect synchrony, providing the mechanical basis for understanding how a stronger frequency (the crystal) can pull a weaker frequency (the client's field) into resonance."

            "question": "According to the biological resonance data in Lesson 2, the electromagnetic field of the human heart is approximately how much stronger than that of the brain?",
            "options": [
                "10 times stronger",
                "100 times stronger",
                "500 times stronger",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates the heart's electromagnetic field is up to 5,000 times stronger than the brain's, making the heart the primary 'engine' for entrainment during a transmutation session."

            "question": "Which specific crystal is recommended in Lesson 3 for its high iron content and 'spongelike' energetic lattice, making it a primary tool for the Absorption Technique?",
            "options": [
                "Black Tourmaline (Schorl)",
                "Amethyst",
                "Selenite",
                "Citrine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Black Tourmaline is highly effective for absorption because its complex, iron-rich structure acts as an energetic 'ground,' pulling in and neutralizing heavy or geopathic stress."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "A practitioner uses an Aragonite Sputnik (star-shaped) to address a client's chronic mental loop. Which transmutation strategy is being applied?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diffusion strategies use radiating geometries (like the points of an Aragonite Sputnik) to break up stagnant, repetitive patterns and scatter them so they can be processed or removed."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Amplification' is described as the final phase of transmutation. What is the primary risk of amplifying a field before the 'Cleansing' and 'Transmutation' steps are complete?",
            "options": [
                "The crystal will lose its color.",
                "The practitioner will experience a headache.",
                "You risk magnifying the existing stagnant or 'negative' patterns along with the healing intent.",
                "The session will simply have no effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Amplification is a 'volume knob'; if you haven't first transmuted the heavy energy, you will simply make the heavy energy louder and more intense for the client."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'Healing Crisis' (Lesson 6) characterized by sudden emotional release and mild nausea 12 hours after a session. What is the scientifically-aligned explanation for this?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner used the wrong crystals.",
                "The client is having a 'Herxheimer-like' reaction where the body's detoxification systems are temporarily overwhelmed by the rapid energetic shift.",
                "The crystals were not cleansed properly before the session.",
                "The client is naturally resistant to crystal healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healing crisis occurs when the body's physical and energetic systems attempt to integrate a rapid shift in frequency, leading to a temporary 'flare-up' of symptoms as toxins or stagnant emotions are purged."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is the 'Neutral Observer' state, and why is it critical for energetic hygiene?",
            "options": [
                "It is a state of boredom that prevents the practitioner from getting tired.",
                "It is a state of non-attachment that prevents 'sympathetic resonance,' ensuring the practitioner doesn't absorb the client's heavy energy.",
                "It involves closing one's eyes to avoid seeing the client's reactions.",
                "It is a technique for memorizing crystal properties during the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Observer state allows the practitioner to facilitate the session without becoming an energetic 'sponge' for the client's released trauma or stress."

            "question": "In the FACETS workflow (Lesson 8), 'Transmutation' (T) occurs immediately after which step?",
            "options": [
                "Foundation (F)",
                "Assessment (A)",
                "Empowerment (E)",
                "Stabilization (S)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The workflow follows F-A-C-E-T-S. Transmutation (T) occurs after Empowerment (E) and before the final Stabilization (S)."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "When performing an absorption technique, how can a practitioner tell if a crystal has reached its 'saturation point'?",
            "options": [
                "The crystal will change temperature significantly (becoming very hot).",
                "The crystal will physically crack in half.",
                "The crystal feels 'sticky,' 'heavy,' or energetically 'muted' to the practitioner's touch.",
                "The client will report feeling a 'spark' of electricity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Saturation is felt as a change in the crystal's tactile or energetic quality; it loses its 'vibrancy' and feels dense or 'sticky' once it can no longer hold more stagnant energy."
