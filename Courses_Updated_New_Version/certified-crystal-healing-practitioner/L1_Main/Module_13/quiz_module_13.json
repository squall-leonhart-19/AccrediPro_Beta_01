            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Seed of Life geometry is a fundamental blueprint in nature that mirrors both the primary chakra system and biological cellular division, making it highly compatible with human physiology."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-energetic shifts during Transmutation often manifest as REM or micro-twitches, indicating the nervous system is integrating new frequency information."
