            "question": "According to the 'Science of Proximity' (L1), how does the intensity of a crystal's bio-magnetic influence change as it is moved further from the body?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases linearly (1/r)",
                "It remains constant within the first 12 inches",
                "It decreases according to the inverse square law (1/r²)",
                "It increases as it enters the mental auric layer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In bio-field physics, the field strength of a dipole (like a crystal's lattice) diminishes according to the inverse square law, meaning doubling the distance reduces the intensity to one-fourth."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hexagon is the foundation of the 'Seed of Life' and mimics carbon-based molecular structures, making it the gold standard for physical/cellular stability."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vectoring directionality dictates that the point acts as a conduit; pointing away from the body facilitates the extraction of energy (extraction technique)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Emotional Layer resides approximately 3-6 inches from the body; hover-placements or 'bridging' within this specific tier targets emotional auric fissures."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dizziness is a sign of ungrounded energy; placing high-iron or grounding stones at the feet (Earth Star or Root) redirects the flow downward."
