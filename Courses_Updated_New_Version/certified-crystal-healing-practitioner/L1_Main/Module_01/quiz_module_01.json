            "question": "According to the principle of Entrainment discussed in Lesson 1, what happens when two oscillating bodies with different frequencies interact?",
            "options": [
                "The lower frequency body will always dominate the higher frequency body.",
                "The body with the more stable, powerful frequency will pull the other into its rhythm.",
                "Both frequencies will cancel each other out, resulting in a 'zero-point' field.",
                "The frequencies will diverge further apart to maintain energetic sovereignty."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the process where a more stable or powerful rhythmic pattern (like a crystal's lattice structure) causes another less stable oscillator (the human biofield) to lock into its frequency."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Which layer of the Auric Field acts as the 'blueprint' for the physical body and is located approximately 0.5 to 2 inches from the skin?",
            "options": [
                "The Astral Body",
                "The Mental Body",
                "The Etheric Body",
                "The Causal Body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Etheric Body is the innermost layer of the aura, serving as the energetic template for the physical form and reflecting immediate physical vitality."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, 'Energetic Congestion' is distinguished from 'Energetic Deficiency.' What tactile sensation is most commonly associated with Congestion during a hand scan?",
            "options": [
                "A cold breeze or 'hollow' sensation",
                "A magnetic pull drawing the hand inward",
                "A prickly, 'static' sensation or dense heat",
                "A complete lack of any sensation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Congestion (excess energy) typically manifests as heat, pressure, or a 'prickly' static sensation, whereas deficiency often feels cold or hollow."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "When performing the Byosen Reikan (Hand Scanning) technique, what does a 'Hibiki' sensation of strong tingling/pulsing in the practitioner's palms indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner is dehydrated and should stop the session.",
                "The area has a high concentration of 'toxins' or energetic disharmony.",
                "The client has reached a state of perfect energetic resonance.",
                "The crystal being used is incompatible with the client's field."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Japanese energetic traditions, 'Hibiki' (resonance) in the form of tingling or pulsing indicates that the practitioner's hands have found an area requiring attention due to disharmony or blockage."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A practitioner is using a pendulum to assess a chakra. The pendulum moves in a very small, tight, counter-clockwise circle. This most likely suggests:",
            "options": [
                "An overactive and expansive energy center.",
                "A balanced and healthy energy flow.",
                "A constricted, stagnant, or 'closed' energy center.",
                "The presence of a secondary impediment only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Counter-clockwise movement in many radiesthesia traditions indicates a 'closing' or 'releasing' motion, and a small/tight diameter suggests low amplitude or stagnation."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "During the Energetic Intake Interview, why is it critical to distinguish between 'Subjective Symptoms' and 'Objective Observations'?",
            "options": [
                "Subjective symptoms are always lies told by the client's ego.",
                "Objective observations are the only data points used to select crystals.",
                "To correlate how the client 'feels' with what the practitioner 'detects' for a holistic baseline.",
                "To ensure the practitioner can charge more for a complex diagnosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesizing the client's internal experience (Subjective) with the practitioner's assessment findings (Objective) creates the most accurate 'Frequency Baseline' for measuring progress."

            "question": "A client presents with chronic tension headaches (Secondary Impediment). Through the intake, you discover they are suppressed by a high-stress job they fear losing (Primary Impediment). Which is the correct treatment priority?",
            "options": [
                "Treat the headaches first with Amethyst, ignoring the job stress.",
                "Treat the fear/stress (Primary) while providing symptomatic relief for the headache (Secondary).",
                "Only treat the Secondary impediment, as the Primary is 'psychological' and not energetic.",
                "Wait 48 hours for the symptoms to clear on their own before applying crystals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective healing addresses the Primary Impediment (the root cause) to prevent recurrence, while simultaneously managing the Secondary Impediment (the symptom) for client comfort."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "What is the 'Delta' in the context of Lesson 8's Synthesizing the Assessment?",
            "options": [
                "The specific crystal shape used for the heart chakra.",
                "The measurable difference between the baseline frequency and the post-session frequency.",
                "The fourth layer of the auric field.",
                "The speed at which a pendulum swings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Delta' represents the change or shift achieved during the session. Without a baseline assessment, the practitioner cannot accurately quantify this change."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "In the study of Bio-Energetic Frequency (Lesson 1), what is the 'Resonant Frequency' of an object?",
            "options": [
                "The frequency at which an object naturally vibrates with least resistance.",
                "The maximum volume a crystal can reach when struck.",
                "The frequency of the Earth's magnetic field (7.83 Hz) only.",
                "The frequency that causes an object to shatter."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Resonant frequency is the natural vibratory rate of an object. In crystal healing, we use the stable resonant frequency of the crystal to influence the human biofield."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "If a practitioner experiences a sensation of 'coldness' during a hand scan over the solar plexus, but the client reports feeling 'burnt out' and 'angry,' this contradiction likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner is making a mistake in their scan.",
                "A 'masked' imbalance where the surface energy is depleted (cold) while the deeper emotional body is congested (anger).",
                "The client's solar plexus is perfectly balanced.",
                "That crystals will not work for this specific client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic imbalances can be multi-layered. A 'cold' sensation often indicates depletion/exhaustion (burnout) which may be the current state of the etheric body, even if the emotional body is experiencing 'heat' or anger."
