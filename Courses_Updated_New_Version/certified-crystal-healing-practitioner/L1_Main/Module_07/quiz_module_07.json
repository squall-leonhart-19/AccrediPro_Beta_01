            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A Vibrational Phase Shift occurs when the client's bio-field successfully entrains with the crystal's frequency, resulting in a perceptible change in the energetic density of the field."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hematite is a premier stabilization stone because its high iron content and hexagonal structure provide a dense, grounding resonance that anchors the shift into physical reality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practitioners must never provide medical diagnoses. They focus on 'energetic imbalances' or 'frequency disharmony' and refer clients to licensed medical professionals for clinical diagnosis."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To manage a healing crisis (Herxheimer-like reaction), the practitioner should prioritize Stabilization (S) by removing high-frequency stones and using grounding minerals to anchor the energy."
