            "options": [
                "To select the most expensive crystals for the client",
                "To map the client's bio-field and identify areas of resonance, dissonance, or depletion",
                "To perform deep tissue massage before applying stones",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Frequency Assessment phase is a diagnostic step where the practitioner maps the energetic blueprint to identify specific imbalances before intervention."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "During the Attunement (A) phase, why is practitioner 'coherent breathing' emphasized?",

                "To ensure the practitioner doesn't pass out",
                "To create a state of heart-brain coherence that stabilizes the practitioner's own bio-field",
                "To blow dust off the crystals",
                "To signal the end of the session to the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioner coherence is vital to prevent 'energetic bleeding' and ensure the practitioner acts as a stable resonant oscillator for the client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cubic system (found in Fluorite or Pyrite) is geometrically the most 'ordered,' making it the clinical choice for grounding mental fog into structured thought."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The K1 point is a primary grounding portal in meridian theory, used in the F.A.C.E.T.S. framework to anchor energy and reduce anxiety."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "During the Transmutation (T) phase, a client experiences a 'healing crisis' (sudden emotional release). What is the practitioner's protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately remove all stones and stop the session",
                "Add more high-frequency stones to the forehead",
                "Maintain the resonant container, encourage breath, and allow the vibrational shift to complete",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transmutation involves the shift of energy; the practitioner must hold a safe, neutral space to allow the client to process the release without interruption."

                "To sell the client a subscription package",
                "To 'lock in' the new vibrational frequency and ensure the client is grounded for physical-world reintegration",
                "To clean the treatment room",
                "To wake the client up as quickly as possible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization ensures that the shifts made during the session are integrated into the physical body and don't dissipate immediately after the client leaves."

            "question": "When selecting a stone for a client with 'overactive' or 'congested' energy in the Solar Plexus, which chemical property is prioritized in the F.A.C.E.T.S. model?",
            "options": [
                "High Iron content for grounding and absorption",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Iron-bearing stones (like Hematite or certain Jaspers) are clinically used for their ability to absorb and ground 'excess' or 'congested' energetic heat."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "In the Case Synthesis (L8), if a client presents with 'Chronic Fatigue' and 'Burnout,' which F.A.C.E.T.S. sequence is most likely indicated?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Burnout requires a 'tonifying' approach—nourishing the field rather than pushing for a massive, exhausting transmutation shift."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which of these is a violation of the 'Clinical Framework' established in Module 10?",
