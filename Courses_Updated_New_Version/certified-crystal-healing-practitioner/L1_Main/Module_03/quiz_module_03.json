            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which trace element, when subjected to natural irradiation within the Earth, is primarily responsible for the violet-to-purple coloration found in Amethyst (Lesson 1)?",
            "options": ["Manganese", "Iron", "Titanium", "Chromium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Amethyst gets its purple color from trace amounts of iron (Fe3+) that have been irradiated. This chemical understanding allows practitioners to select stones based on specific mineralogical properties rather than just appearance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a need for extreme grounding and 'structural' support in their life. Based on Lesson 2, which crystal lattice system—characterized by three axes of equal length at 90-degree angles—is most appropriate?",
            "options": ["Triclinic", "Monoclinic", "Cubic (Isometric)", "Hexagonal"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cubic (or Isometric) system is the most symmetrical and stable of all lattice structures, making it the primary choice for grounding and establishing structural order in a client's energetic field."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In Chromotherapy (Lesson 3), the 'Cooling Effect' is associated with the blue frequency (approx. 450-495nm). Statistically, how does this frequency impact the autonomic nervous system during a session?",
            "options": ["It stimulates the sympathetic response, increasing heart rate.", "It triggers a parasympathetic response, lowering blood pressure and respiration.", "It has no measurable effect on physiological markers.", "It increases cortisol production to enhance alertness."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light frequencies are scientifically associated with the parasympathetic nervous system, which induces a calming effect, lowers heart rate, and reduces blood pressure, making blue stones ideal for stress-related selection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "According to the Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness (Lesson 4), which of the following crystals would be considered 'unsafe' for water-based cleansing due to its low rating (approx. 2.0) and solubility?",
            "options": ["Quartz", "Selenite", "Jadeite", "Tourmaline"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenite has a Mohs hardness of approximately 2.0 and is a sulfate mineral, meaning it can dissolve or lose its luster when exposed to water. Practitioners must understand these physical limits to ensure tool longevity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the 'Analytical-Intuitive Loop.' What is the primary purpose of this methodology in a professional setting?",
            "options": ["To ignore scientific data in favor of 'gut feelings.'", "To use intuition to form a hypothesis and then validate it using mineralogical data.", "To rely solely on textbooks without ever touching the crystals.", "To allow the client to pick stones based only on their favorite colors."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Analytical-Intuitive Loop is a professional standard that balances the practitioner's intuitive hits with hard mineralogical science, ensuring a selection that is both energetically resonant and logically sound."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "When 'Intentional Mapping' for a client struggling with acute emotional anxiety (Lesson 6), why is Lepidolite often selected over other purple stones?",
            "options": ["Because it is the hardest stone on the Mohs scale.", "Due to its high Lithium content, which is used in clinical settings for mood stabilization.", "Because it is the most expensive and therefore the most powerful.", "Due to its cubic lattice structure which prevents energy movement."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lepidolite contains high concentrations of lithium, a mineral used in pharmacology for mood stabilization. In crystal healing, we map this chemical property to emotional states requiring calming and stabilization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7 (Crystal Synergy), the 'Amplification Principle' suggests that pairing a specific mineral with Clear Quartz does what to the session's efficacy?",
            "options": ["It neutralizes the primary stone's energy.", "It focuses and intensifies the vibrational output of the primary stone.", "It changes the chemical composition of the primary stone.", "It makes the session take twice as long to complete."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clear Quartz acts as a natural amplifier due to its piezoelectric properties and hexagonal structure, which focuses and intensifies the specific frequency of the stones it is paired with."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Regarding 'Ethical Sourcing' (Lesson 8), what is the term used to describe the cumulative energetic impact of a crystal's journey from the mine to the practitioner?",
            "options": ["Mineral Migration", "Energetic Lineage", "Supply Chain Static", "Vibrational Variance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic Lineage refers to the 'vibrational history' of a stone. Ethical sourcing ensures that this lineage is free from the imprints of exploitation, which can affect the stone's therapeutic utility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A practitioner is creating a 'Direct Method' gem elixir. Based on Lesson 4 and Lesson 1, why is Malachite strictly contraindicated for this application?",
            "options": ["It is too hard and will break the glass.", "It contains high levels of copper which can be toxic if ingested.", "It will turn the water purple, staining the container.", "It loses its color when exposed to light."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide. When placed directly in water, it can leach toxic levels of copper into the liquid, making it dangerous for consumption. This highlights the necessity of chemical knowledge in selection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which lattice system (Lesson 2) is characterized by a six-sided structure and is biologically 'resonant' with the human body's own organized cellular water structures?",
            "options": ["Triclinic", "Orthorhombic", "Hexagonal", "Amorphous"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hexagonal system (including the Trigonal subsystem) is the structure of Quartz. Research into 'structured water' suggests that this geometry is highly resonant with the organized water found in human cells and tissues."
