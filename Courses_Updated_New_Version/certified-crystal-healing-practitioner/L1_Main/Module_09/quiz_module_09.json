            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "According to the mechanics of stabilization, why are high-density minerals like Hematite (Specific Gravity ~5.3) preferred for grounding over low-density minerals like Amber?",
            "options": ["They contain more oxygen for the blood", "Their molecular mass creates a stronger gravitational and energetic 'anchor' in the auric field", "High density always correlates with higher vibration", "They are more resistant to scratching"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mineral density or Specific Gravity dictates how a crystal interacts with the physical field; higher mass provides a more significant stabilizing and grounding effect."
