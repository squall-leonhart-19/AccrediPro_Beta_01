            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™, what does the 'E' specifically represent in the practitioner's workflow?",
            "options": ["Emotional Release", "Etheric Alignment", "Energy Placement", "Elemental Balancing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'E' stands for Energy Placement, which involves the strategic positioning of crystals on meridians, chakras, or specific grid points to direct vibrational flow."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "During a Frequency Assessment (L2), a practitioner detects a 'vibrational tear' located approximately 2-4 inches from the physical body. Which layer is being assessed?",
            "options": ["The Astral Body", "The Etheric Body", "The Causal Body", "The Mental Body"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Etheric Body is the layer closest to the physical form (0.5 to 4 inches) and is the primary focus for identifying immediate energetic leaks or tears."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "The 'Attunement' phase (L3) utilizes the principle of 'Phase-Locking.' What is the primary objective of this process?",
            "options": ["To force the client's cells to vibrate at the crystal's frequency instantly", "To synchronize the practitioner's and client's heart-brain coherence to create a receptive healing container", "To lock the crystals into place so they do not move during the session", "To prevent the practitioner from absorbing the client's karma"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attunement is about creating a unified biofield through heart-brain coherence, allowing for 'Phase-Locking' where the two fields work in resonance rather than opposition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "A client requires deep structural change and 're-ordering' of chaotic thoughts. Based on Lattice Systems (L4), which system is most appropriate for providing this sense of 'linear order'?",
            "options": ["Amorphous (no structure)", "Triclinic (highly complex)", "Isometric (cubic/perfect symmetry)", "Monoclinic (unbalanced)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Isometric (Cubic) systems provide the highest level of symmetry and structure, making them ideal for clients needing stability, grounding, and linear mental re-ordering."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Which chemical element, often found in stones like Hematite and Magnetite, is prioritized in the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™ for 'Magnetic Grounding' during the Stabilization phase?",
            "options": ["Aluminum", "Iron", "Lithium", "Copper"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron-bearing minerals are essential for grounding because they resonate with the Earth's magnetic field and help anchor the client's awareness back into the physical body."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the Transmutation phase (L6), the 'Piezoelectric Effect' is triggered by what action from the practitioner?",
            "options": ["Washing the crystal in salt water", "Applying focused intention and slight physical pressure or warmth to the crystal", "Placing the crystal in direct sunlight", "Leaving the room to let the crystal work alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Piezoelectric Effect in quartz occurs when mechanical stress (pressure) or thermal changes (warmth/intent) convert into an electrical charge, stimulating the client's biofield."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "According to the Energy Placement protocols (L5), a 'Triangulation Grid' is primarily used to:",
            "options": ["Keep the energy static and unmoving", "Accelerate and direct energy toward a specific point of transmutation", "Cool down an overactive chakra", "Connect the client to the lunar cycle"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation is a dynamic geometric placement used to create a 'vortex' effect, accelerating the shift from stagnant energy to a higher vibrational state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "In the L8 Case Analysis of 'Client Marcus,' who suffered from 'Vibrational Fragmentation' after a traumatic event, which sequence was used to restore his field?",
            "options": ["Transmutation followed by immediate discharge", "Frequency Assessment, then Attunement, then stabilizing with Black Tourmaline", "Selection of Amorphous stones to break up the trauma", "Skip Attunement to avoid emotional triggers"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The F.A.C.E.T.S. sequence must be followed linearly; for fragmentation, assessing the gaps, attuning the field, and then using grounding stones like Black Tourmaline is the standard protocol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "What is the '25% Rule' established in Lesson 7 (Stabilization)?",
            "options": ["25% of the crystals must be clear quartz", "At least 25% of the total session time should be dedicated to grounding and integration", "The practitioner should only charge 25% of their fee for the first session", "Only 25% of the chakras should be treated at once"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To ensure lasting results and avoid 'healing crises,' at least 25% of the session duration must be reserved for the Stabilization phase to ground the shift."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A practitioner notices the client's breathing becomes shallow and their eyes flicker rapidly during the Transmutation phase. This is a clinical sign of:",
            "options": ["A failed session", "The 'Vibrational Shift' or 'Release Point' occurring", "The client falling asleep", "An allergic reaction to the crystals"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid Eye Movement (REM-like) and changes in respiratory patterns are physiological indicators that the client's nervous system is processing a vibrational shift or 'Release Point' during transmutation."
