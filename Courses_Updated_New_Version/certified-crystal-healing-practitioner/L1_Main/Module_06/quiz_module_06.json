            "question": "What is the primary objective of 'Stabilization' within the CHASIS framework as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the frequency of the crown chakra to its maximum limit",
                "To anchor the newly achieved vibrational shift into the physical cellular structure",
                "To clear the practitioner's tools before the next client arrives",
                "To induce a deep state of REM sleep during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization is the process of 'locking in' the energetic changes so they don't dissipate, ensuring the shift is integrated at a cellular level rather than remaining only in the subtle bodies."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, which physiological metric is most significantly improved when a client achieves 'Bio-Field Coherence' through earthing stones?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose Levels",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Bone Density",
                "Visual Acuity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bio-field coherence is closely linked to the autonomic nervous system; an increase in HRV indicates a balanced state between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, facilitated by earthing."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 highlights the mineralogy of Hematite. Why is its high 'Specific Gravity' (approx. 5.3) relevant to stabilization?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the stone to float in water for cleansing",
                "It creates a 'weighty' sensory feedback that triggers the somatic nervous system to ground",
                "It indicates a high concentration of silica for mental clarity",
                "It makes the stone translucent when held to the light"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High specific gravity (density) provides a physical 'heaviness' that helps the client's consciousness return to the physical body, a key component of rooting."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "When 'Sealing the Auric Field' using geometric gridding (Lesson 4), which shape is most effective for creating a stable, protective boundary for longevity?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hexagon is nature's most efficient and structurally sound shape for sealing and storage, making it the gold standard for long-term auric protection."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In Somatic Integration (Lesson 5), what is the 'Vagal Anchor' technique used for?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate the third eye during meditation",
                "To use a grounding stone to stimulate the Vagus nerve, signaling safety to the brain",
                "To increase the client's heart rate for better circulation",
                "To prevent the client from talking during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagal Anchor involves placing a grounding stone on the solar plexus or chest to stimulate the parasympathetic response, helping the body accept the energetic shift."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 identifies the '72-Hour Window' as critical. What is a common sign of 'Integration Fatigue' during this period?",
            "options": [
                "Sudden bursts of frantic energy",
                "A temporary, heavy tiredness as the physical body recalibrates",
                "Complete loss of memory regarding the session",
                "An immediate desire to buy more crystals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration fatigue is a sign that the physical body is doing the 'heavy lifting' of processing the energetic changes, often manifesting as a need for extra rest."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Where is the Earth Star Chakra (Vasundhara) located, and what is its primary function in advanced stabilization?",
            "options": [
                "At the base of the spine; it controls survival instincts",
                "6-12 inches below the feet; it anchors the individual into the planetary grid",
                "In the center of the palms; it transmits healing energy",
                "At the back of the neck; it protects against psychic attacks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Earth Star Chakra is located below the feet and serves as the 'grounding wire' for the entire chakra system into the Earth's crystalline core."

                "A technique used to release excess red jasper energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic bleed occurs when the session isn't properly closed, leading to the practitioner feeling the client's emotions or symptoms after they leave."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'floaty' and disconnected from reality 24 hours after a session. Based on Lesson 6, which advice is most appropriate?",

                "Hold a piece of Clear Quartz to amplify the feeling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protein-rich foods (heavy/dense) and earthing are standard somatic protocols for bringing 'floaty' energy back into the physical body."
