            "question": "During the Bio-Field Mapping Technique, a practitioner identifies a 'dense' sensation approximately 4-6 inches away from the physical body. Which layer of the bio-field is most likely being assessed?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Emotional Body typically extends 2-5 inches from the physical body. Sensations of density or 'heaviness' in this field often relate to unprocessed emotional energy."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A client experiences 'Vibrational Irritability'—a temporary spike in anxiety—during a transmutation session. What is the recommended practitioner response according to Lesson 5?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Once a space is cleared of stagnant energy, it creates a 'void.' A professional practitioner must immediately 'seal' or 'fill' that void with a specific intended frequency (Ritual Attunement)."

                "Maintain the energetic support and recommend the client see a licensed mental health professional for integration",
                "Tell the client exactly what happened in their past life to cause the tear"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 emphasizes Scope of Practice. Practitioners support the energetic body but must refer clients to licensed professionals for psychological or medical diagnosis and treatment."
