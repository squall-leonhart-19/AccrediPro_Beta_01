            "question": "When scaling the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™ for a group of 20+ participants, which modification is most critical for the 'Frequency' phase to prevent energetic overwhelm?",
            "options": [
                "Using high-vibration crystals like Phenacite for everyone immediately",
                "Establishing a 'Collective Baseline' through synchronized breathwork before introducing crystals",
                "Increasing the size of the crystals used by the practitioner by 300%",
                "Shortening the attunement time to under 5 minutes to avoid fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In group settings, the F.A.C.E.T.S. Method™ requires a 'Collective Baseline.' Synchronized breathwork aligns the group's biofields, making the subsequent frequency work more stable and less likely to cause energetic overwhelm (Lesson 1)."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "In Macro-Gridding (Lesson 4), what is the primary function of the 'Master Anchor' stone when gridding a large venue?",
            "options": [
                "To serve as the aesthetic centerpiece of the room",
                "To absorb all negative emotions from the participants",
                "To act as the central CPU, regulating the flow between perimeter stones",
                "To provide a physical boundary that participants cannot cross"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Master Anchor acts as the central processing unit of the macro-grid, regulating and distributing energy between the perimeter stones to maintain a stable, coherent field throughout the entire space (Lesson 4)."

        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Space Holding' protocols in Lesson 3, what should a practitioner do if a 'Contagious Emotional Release' occurs in a group setting?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stop the workshop and clear the room",
                "Focus solely on the first person who started crying",
                "Widen their own energetic field (The 'Big Container' technique) and maintain a neutral rhythmic breath",
                "Ask everyone to put their crystals away to stop the energy flow"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 teaches the 'Big Container' technique, where the practitioner expands their own field to hold the collective emotion without becoming entangled in it, using rhythmic breath to model stability for the group."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "When designing a 4-hour High-Impact Crystal Workshop (Lesson 2), what is the 'Golden Ratio' for teaching vs. experiential application?",
            "options": [
                "90% Teaching, 10% Application",
                "50% Teaching, 50% Application",
                "30% Teaching, 70% Application",
                "10% Teaching, 90% Application"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-impact workshops follow a 30/70 ratio. Adults learn best through direct experience; therefore, 70% of the time should be spent on hands-on crystal work, meditation, or gridding (Lesson 2)."

            "options": [
                "Ship kits 3 days before the event",
                "Ship kits 14–21 days before the event to account for logistics and 'energetic settling'",
                "Email a list of crystals and have students buy their own at the last minute",
                "Ship kits the day after the first live session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 recommends a 14–21 day buffer. This accounts for shipping delays and allows the crystals to 'settle' and integrate into the student's home environment before the program begins."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "During 'Collective Transmutation' (Lesson 5), which crystal is most effective for neutralizing the 'Grey Fog'—the collective shadow energy released during group work?",
            "options": [
                "Large Smoky Quartz clusters or Black Tourmaline 'Sentinels'",
                "Small Clear Quartz points",
                "Amethyst geodes only",
                "Rose Quartz spheres"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Smoky Quartz and Black Tourmaline are used as 'Sentinels' in collective transmutation because of their high capacity to ground and neutralize dense, low-frequency releases from multiple people simultaneously (Lesson 5)."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Group Stabilization' protocols in Lesson 6, what is the '48-Hour Integration Rule'?",
            "options": [
                "Participants must not eat for 48 hours",
                "Participants should avoid major life decisions and high-stress environments for 48 hours post-workshop",
                "The practitioner must call every student within 48 hours",
                "The crystals used must be buried in salt for 48 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 48-hour rule is a stabilization protocol where students are advised to avoid major life decisions while their energy field is still in the 'plastic' state of integration following high-vibration group work (Lesson 6)."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "When gridding a large venue (Lesson 4), what is the maximum recommended distance between perimeter stones to maintain a 'Resonance Wall'?",
            "options": [
                "50 feet",
                "10-15 feet",
                "Distance does not matter as long as they are in the corners",
                "2 feet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain a coherent 'Resonance Wall' in macro-gridding, stones should generally be placed every 10-15 feet. Beyond this, the energetic field tends to 'sag' or lose its protective tension (Lesson 4)."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "In the 'Business of Workshops' (Lesson 7), what is the 'Anchor Pricing' strategy recommended for a new practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Offer the workshop for free to get people in the door",
                "Price based on the cost of crystals + 10%",
                "Set a 'Premium Tier' that includes a private session to increase the perceived value of the general admission",
                "Always charge exactly $97 regardless of the content"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anchor pricing involves offering a high-value 'Premium' or 'VIP' tier. This not only increases revenue but makes the standard ticket price feel more accessible and high-value by comparison (Lesson 7)."

        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "What is the primary challenge of 'Digital Facilitation' (Lesson 8) compared to in-person workshops?",
            "options": [
                "You cannot use crystals online",
                "The 'Latency of Connection'—the difficulty in reading the subtle biofield shifts of participants through a screen",
                "Virtual programs are always less profitable",
                "Students cannot hear the practitioner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary challenge in virtual work is the 'Latency of Connection.' Practitioners must learn 'Digital Empathy' to sense the group's energetic state without the physical proximity of their biofields (Lesson 8)."
