            "question": "In the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. Methodology™, why is 'Establish Safety' (E) positioned immediately after 'Recognize the Cycle' (R) and before 'Cleave the Trauma Bond' (C)?",
            "options": [
                "Because trauma bonds cannot be effectively addressed while the survivor is still under active, direct manipulation or threat.",
                "Because the survivor needs to build their authentic self before they can be safe.",
                "To ensure the practitioner is legally protected from the perpetrator's actions.",
                "Because No Contact is only required for the 'Integrate' phase of recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Safety is the prerequisite for neurobiological stabilization. Attempting to 'Cleave the Trauma Bond' while still in active contact with the intermittent reinforcement of the abuser is statistically less effective due to the ongoing 'dopamine hits' the survivor receives during the cycle."
        },

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "Which neurobiological mechanism is primarily responsible for the 'addiction' felt in a trauma bond during the 'C' phase of the R.E.C.L.A.I.M. methodology?",
            "options": [
                "Low levels of cortisol in the prefrontal cortex.",
                "The upregulation of GABA receptors during the devaluation phase.",
                "Intermittent reinforcement causing unpredictable dopamine surges in the reward circuitry.",
                "A permanent depletion of oxytocin in the amygdala."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement—the unpredictable delivery of rewards (love bombing) and punishments (devaluation)—creates a powerful biochemical dependency, similar to gambling addiction, primarily involving the dopaminergic pathways."

        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "A client is experiencing intense 'emotional flashbacks' where they feel like a small child being scolded, despite being in a safe environment. According to the 'Activate Regulation' (A) phase, what is the priority intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Analyzing the childhood origin of the flashback immediately.",
                "Utilizing somatic grounding to return the client to their 'Window of Tolerance' and Ventral Vagal state.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the 'A' phase, the priority is autonomic nervous system regulation. Somatic grounding techniques help the client exit the sympathetic (fight/flight) or dorsal vagal (freeze) state and return to the Ventral Vagal state (safety and social engagement)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DARVO (Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender) is a common manipulation strategy used by abusers to avoid accountability by making themselves appear as the injured party."

            "id": "final_5",

                "A specific type of boundary-setting technique used in Grey Rock.",
                "The biological markers of chronic stress found in the bloodstream."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introjects are internalized ideas or voices from others. In narcissistic abuse, the survivor often carries the abuser's devaluing voice as their own internal monologue, which must be dismantled to 'Locate the Authentic Self.'"

            "options": [
                "To make the abuser feel guilty for their behavior.",
                "To provide the abuser with clear feedback on how to improve the relationship.",
                "To become so uninteresting and emotionally non-responsive that the abuser loses their 'narcissistic supply.'",
                "To gather evidence for a legal case by baiting the abuser into an outburst."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grey Rock is a harm-reduction strategy used when No Contact is impossible (e.g., co-parenting). The goal is to be as boring and non-reactive as a grey rock, causing the abuser to seek supply elsewhere."

                "The person uses gaslighting to make you doubt your memory of an event."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Pink Flag' is an area of concern that needs observation. If a person can accept a boundary and adjust their behavior, it demonstrates the capacity for relational health, unlike the other options which are definitive Red Flags."

                "There is no difference; they are treated identically.",

                "Traits are always more dangerous than the full disorder.",
                "NPD can be cured with medication, while traits cannot."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NPD is a clinical diagnosis requiring a specific cluster of persistent behaviors. While narcissistic traits are harmful, they may not meet the full diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder."

            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "The 'Integrate the Narrative' (I) phase focuses on Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG). A key indicator of PTG in a survivor is:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PTG involves finding meaning and growth following trauma. It is not about forgetting or excusing the abuse, but about the survivor's internal transformation and resilience."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "final_12",
            "question": "Research indicates that survivors of narcissistic abuse often suffer from C-PTSD. What does the 'C' in C-PTSD stand for, and how does it differ from PTSD?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic; it refers to the duration of the flashbacks.",
                "Complex; it refers to trauma resulting from repeated, prolonged interpersonal betrayal where escape is difficult.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital safety is crucial as many narcissists use technology for stalking and harassment. Monitoring the abuser or engaging with mutual friends (potential flying monkeys) increases risk."
