            "question": "In the RECLAIM Strategic Architecture, why must the 'R' (Recognition) and 'E' (Establishment of Safety) phases precede any deep narrative processing?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client has sufficient financial resources to pay for long-term therapy",
                "To stabilize the nervous system and ensure physical safety, preventing retraumatization during processing",
                "Because narrative processing is only effective after the narcissistic partner has been legally served",
                "To allow the therapist time to build a case against the abuser for court proceedings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization is the clinical priority; without a regulated nervous system (within the Window of Tolerance) and physical safety, 'I' phase narrative integration can trigger severe dissociative episodes or trauma flooding."

            "question": "During the 'C' Phase (Dismantling the Trauma Bond), which neurobiological mechanism is primarily responsible for the 'withdrawal' symptoms similar to substance addiction?",
            "options": [
                "The depletion of Serotonin due to chronic stress",
                "The calcification of the Pineal gland from cortisol exposure",
                "The intermittent reinforcement schedule that creates a dopamine-driven compulsion to seek the 'reward' (abuser's validation)",
                "The permanent shutdown of the Prefrontal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement creates a powerful biochemical bond where the brain craves the dopamine hit associated with the 'love-bombing' or 'reconciliation' phase, making the trauma bond physiologically addictive."

            "question": "In Lesson 4 (Identity Restoration), the 'Lost Self' phenomenon is addressed. Which intervention is most appropriate for a client in the 'L' Phase experiencing 'Identity Void'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity restoration (L Phase) focuses on reclaiming the self through values-based work and Agency Reconstruction, helping the client move from 'victim' to an autonomous 'agent' of their own life."

            "id": "q21_4",

            "options": [
                "To encourage higher-level cognitive problem solving immediately",
                "To utilize heavy aerobic exercise to 'burn off' the energy",
                "Gently moving the client from a state of 'shutdown' or 'collapse' back into the Window of Tolerance using grounding techniques",
                "To ignore the physical symptoms and focus only on the 'Cognitive Dissonance' (FOG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state represents a 'freeze' or 'collapse' response. Regulation planning (A Phase) focuses on gentle titration to bring the client back into a state of social engagement or safe mobilization."

                "Narrative Integration requires the abuser to admit their faults in writing",
                "It involves transforming a fragmented, trauma-heavy story into a cohesive autobiography with the client as the empowered protagonist",
                "It is only successful if the client writes a book about their experience",
                "It focuses exclusively on the abuser's childhood trauma rather than the client's experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative Integration (I Phase) moves beyond repetitive rumination by helping the client synthesize the experience into a coherent life story that emphasizes their resilience and agency."

                "The other person's hatred for the same people the client dislikes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery (M Phase) involves discernment. A key 'Green Flag' is the ability of a potential partner to receive a 'No' or a boundary with respect, rather than reacting with manipulation or anger."

                "Only if the client reaches out first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relapse prevention (L8) teaches that hoovering often follows a predictable pattern related to the abuser's need for 'supply' or when the client shows signs of successful independence (milestones)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PTG is the ultimate goal of the RECLAIM model, where the client doesn't just return to their 'pre-abuse' state but develops deeper resilience, new possibilities, and increased personal strength."

                "By telling the client they are 'crazy' for remembering good times",
                "By ignoring the good memories and only talking about the bad ones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Euphoric Recall is a symptom of the trauma bond. Treatment planning must include 'Reality Testing' to help the client integrate the 'good' and 'bad' versions of the abuser, breaking the cognitive dissonance."
