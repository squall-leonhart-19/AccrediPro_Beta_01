            "question": "When screening for DARVO (Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender) patterns, which behavior most accurately represents the 'Reverse Victim' stage?",
            "options": [
                "The abuser claiming they are the one being 'harassed' or 'abused' after being confronted with evidence of their behavior.",
                "The abuser denying that the specific event ever occurred.",
                "The abuser attacking the victim's credibility or mental health.",
                "The victim apologizing for the abuser's outburst to keep the peace."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Reverse Victim' stage occurs when the perpetrator assumes the role of the victim, often claiming that the actual victim's attempts to set boundaries or hold them accountable are themselves forms of 'abuse' or 'harassment.'"

            "question": "In the psychometric evaluation of a trauma bond, which neurochemical 'loop' is primarily responsible for the addictive nature of intermittent reinforcement?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin and Melatonin",
                "Dopamine and Oxytocin",

                "Cortisol and Adrenaline only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma bonds are reinforced by the 'push-pull' of dopamine (during the craving/pursuit phase) and oxytocin (during the 'hoovering' or reconciliation phase), creating a powerful biochemical dependency similar to substance addiction."

            "question": "According to ICD-11 criteria for Complex PTSD (C-PTSD), which 'Disturbance in Self-Organization' (DSO) must be assessed in addition to standard PTSD symptoms?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ICD-11 distinguishes C-PTSD from PTSD by the presence of three 'Disturbances in Self-Organization': affective dysregulation, negative self-concept (feelings of worthlessness/guilt), and persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships."

                "Has gained more confidence in their decision-making abilities.",
                "Believes that their life outcomes are determined by the abuser or outside forces rather than their own actions.",

                "Is practicing healthy radical acceptance of their situation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity erosion often results in an external locus of control, where the victim feels powerless and believes that their safety and well-being depend entirely on the abuser's moods or external circumstances."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data (Glass et al., 2008) shows that non-fatal strangulation is a significant predictor of future homicide, increasing the risk of being killed by 750%."

            "question": "During a 'Boundary Audit,' a client who exhibits 'Emotional Contagion'—instantly taking on the abuser's anger or depression as their own—is demonstrating which type of boundary?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Porous boundaries allow the abuser's emotions and demands to flood the victim's space, leading to emotional contagion and a loss of the 'self-other' distinction."

                "The client can tell a chronological story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.",
                "The client uses 'I' statements and expresses personal agency in their story.",
                "The client's story is disjointed, lacks emotional affect, or contains significant 'time skips' and contradictions.",
                "The client is able to identify themes of growth and resilience in their narrative."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fragmented narratives are a hallmark of unprocessed trauma and dissociation; the inability to form a coherent, chronological story indicates that the trauma has not yet been integrated into the client's autobiographical memory."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) measures five domains of positive change. Which of the following is NOT one of those domains?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) is not about returning to the 'old self' (pre-trauma personality), but rather evolving into a 'new self' that has integrated the trauma and found new meaning, strength, and possibilities."

            "question": "When using longitudinal tracking tools like the PHQ-9 (Depression) and GAD-7 (Anxiety) with survivors of narcissistic abuse, why might scores initially *increase* during the first month of 'No Contact'?",
            "options": [
                "Because the client is experiencing 'withdrawal' from the trauma bond and the cessation of survival-based dissociation.",
                "Because the therapy is failing and the practitioner should change their approach.",
                "Because the client is likely exaggerating symptoms to gain attention.",
                "Because the abuser has likely stopped their abusive behavior, leaving the client bored."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Initial spikes in anxiety and depression after 'No Contact' are common as the 'survival numbing' or dissociation wears off, and the client experiences the physiological withdrawal from the dopamine/oxytocin loops of the trauma bond."
