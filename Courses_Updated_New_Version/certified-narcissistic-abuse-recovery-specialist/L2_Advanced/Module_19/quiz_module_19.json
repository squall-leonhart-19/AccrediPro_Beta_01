            "question": "Neuroimaging studies of survivors with Narcissistic Victim Syndrome (NVS) frequently show hyper-activation in which area of the brain responsible for the 'fight-or-flight' response?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Hippocampus",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala becomes hyper-responsive in NVS survivors, leading to chronic states of anxiety and emotional dysregulation, while the Prefrontal Cortex often shows reduced activity."

                "The unpredictable spikes of Dopamine during the 'reward' phase",

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to Jennifer Freyd’s Betrayal Trauma Theory, 'betrayal blindness' is a survival mechanism that allows the victim to:",

                "Forget the abuse ever happened permanently",
                "Maintain a necessary attachment to a person they depend on for survival",
                "Develop narcissistic traits themselves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Betrayal blindness occurs when the victim's brain 'ignores' or 'minimizes' the abuse to preserve a relationship that is essential for their social or physical survival."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the context of epigenetics, how can narcissistic abuse be 'transmitted' to future generations without a direct change to the DNA sequence?",
            "options": [
                "Through DNA methylation and histone modification that alters gene expression",
                "Through the spontaneous mutation of the X-chromosome",
                "It cannot be transmitted biologically, only through behavior",
                "Through the reduction of red blood cell counts in offspring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic changes like DNA methylation can alter how genes are expressed in response to trauma, and these 'tags' can be passed down to offspring."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "The ICD-11 differentiates Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) from standard PTSD by the inclusion of 'Disturbances in Self-Organization' (DSO). Which of these is a DSO symptom?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that it typically takes 3-6 months for the nervous system to exit a state of 'high alert' and for cortisol levels to begin normalizing after total separation."

            "options": [
                "To diagnose the abuser with a personality disorder",
                "To provide empirical validation of the survivor's subjective improvement",
                "To predict the exact date the survivor will be 'cured'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Outcome measures like the NASS provide objective data to validate the survivor's progress and help the practitioner adjust the recovery plan based on evidence."

            "options": [
                "It has no measurable impact",
                "It significantly reduces the 'rumination phase' by providing external reality testing",
                "It increases the time spent in the 'victim' stage",
                "It is only effective if the abuser also attends therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early validation acts as a 'reality anchor,' which research shows reduces the duration and intensity of the rumination phase by breaking the cycle of self-doubt/gaslighting."
