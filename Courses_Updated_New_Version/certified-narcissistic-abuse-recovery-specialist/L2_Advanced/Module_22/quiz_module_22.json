            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must recognize the 'Clinical Referral Threshold.' Severe dissociative symptoms and hallucinations fall outside the scope of recovery coaching and require immediate clinical intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical application involves identifying 'narcissistic patterns' to aid the survivor's recovery, as practitioners cannot ethically or legally diagnose a third party who is not their patient."
