            "options": [
                "To trigger the 'fight or flight' response during a flashback",
                "To provide a temporal and spatial context to 'hot' emotional memories",
                "To suppress the amygdala's activity through logic and reasoning",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative integration requires the Hippocampus to provide a 'time stamp' and context to fragmented, emotional memories stored in the amygdala, allowing the survivor to view the trauma as a past event rather than a present threat."

            "options": [
                "It carries the physiological charge of the trauma",
                "It is responsible for daily functioning and avoiding traumatic memories",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ANP (Apparently Normal Part) is the part of the personality that manages daily life and social roles, often by defensively distancing itself from the 'Emotional Parts' (EP) that carry the trauma."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive dissonance in trauma survivors often results from a lack of integration between the logical understanding (often left-hemisphere) and the emotional/somatic memory (often right-hemisphere/limbic)."
