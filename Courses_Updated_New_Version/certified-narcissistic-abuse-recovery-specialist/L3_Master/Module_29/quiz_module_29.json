                "The focus shifts from cognitive understanding of narcissism to the physiological regulation of the nervous system.",
                "It represents a shift from linear, step-by-step healing to a non-linear, embodied state where the framework becomes an intuitive way of being.",
                "It is the stage where the survivor finally achieves 'No Contact' with all toxic individuals in their life.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the legal and financial disentanglement from the narcissistic abuser."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Integration is the phase where the R.E.C.L.A.I.M.™ principles move from being external tools to internalised, non-linear expressions of the self."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma often results in 'speechless terror' where the Broca's area is inhibited, making neuro-narrative integration essential to bridge the gap between body and story."

                "Because it encourages the individual to ignore the reality of their past trauma.",
                "Because it focuses too much on the future and not enough on the 'here and now.'",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the survivor identity is a necessary step, staying in it too long can make the trauma the primary defining characteristic of the person, limiting further growth."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An unexamined Rescuer Shadow in a specialist can lead to over-functioning, which mirrors the codependent dynamics the client is trying to escape."
