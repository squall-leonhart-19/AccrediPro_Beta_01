            "question": "In the neurobiology of trauma bonds, which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for the 'craving' and 'seeking' behavior observed during the intermittent reinforcement cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin",
                "Dopamine",
                "GABA",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter involved in the reward system. During intermittent reinforcement, the unpredictability of the reward (affection or validation) causes a massive dopamine spike, creating a chemical addiction to the cycle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BIFF communication (Brief, Informative, Friendly, Firm) is the standard for parallel parenting because it limits the narcissist's ability to find 'hooks' for conflict while maintaining a professional tone for court records."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Financial narcissists often use 'economic sabotage,' including draining joint accounts, hiding assets in shell companies, or incurring debt in the victim's name to maintain power and ensure the survivor cannot afford legal representation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Scapegoat is typically the most resilient or perceptive member of the family. Because they are the target of the family's projected shame, they have the least 'incentive' to maintain the status quo and are often the first to see the truth."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DARVO is a manipulation tactic designed to shift accountability. By attacking the survivor and claiming the role of the victim, the narcissist creates confusion and forces the survivor into a defensive posture."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The period of separation is statistically the most dangerous. When a narcissist loses control (narcissistic injury), they often escalate their tactics to 'annihilation'—whether financial, legal, or physical—to regain dominance."
