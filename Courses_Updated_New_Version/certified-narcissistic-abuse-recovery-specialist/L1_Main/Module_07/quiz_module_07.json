            "question": "Which of the following best describes the physiological difference between Discernment and Hypervigilance as taught in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Discernment is rooted in the sympathetic nervous system (fight/flight), while hypervigilance is a cognitive process.",
                "Hypervigilance is a state of chronic sympathetic arousal (fear-based), whereas discernment is a state of grounded ventral vagal awareness (observation-based).",
                "Discernment requires total isolation to function, while hypervigilance occurs only in social settings.",
                "There is no physiological difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Discernment is an expansive, grounded state that allows for objective observation, while hypervigilance is a restrictive, fear-based state driven by the nervous system's attempt to prevent past trauma from recurring."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Red Flags 2.0' focuses on subtle manipulation. Which behavior is considered a 'micro-boundary test'?",
            "options": [
                "Asking for a small favor that slightly inconveniences you to see if you will say 'no'.",
                "Showing up three hours late to a first date without calling.",
                "Aggressively demanding access to your social media passwords.",
                "Publicly insulting your career choices during a dinner party."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Micro-boundary tests are subtle. Manipulators often use small, seemingly insignificant requests to gauge a person's level of compliance or their ability to maintain personal limits before escalating to larger violations."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "The 'Green Flag Framework' (Lesson 3) emphasizes 'Consistency over Intensity.' Why is this distinction critical for survivors?",
            "options": [
                "Intensity is a sign of true soulmate connection.",
                "High intensity is often a precursor to love-bombing, whereas consistency demonstrates reliable character over time.",
                "Consistency is easier to fake than intensity.",
                "Survivors should avoid all intense emotions in new relationships."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Healthy dynamics are built on predictable, reliable behavior (consistency). Narcissistic dynamics often rely on high-intensity 'peaks' (love-bombing) to create a trauma bond that masks a lack of real substance."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Advanced Boundary Architecture' (Lesson 4), what is the primary difference between a 'Wall' and a 'Gate'?",
            "options": [
                "Walls are used for family; Gates are used for friends.",
                "A Wall is a permanent barrier that prevents all intimacy; a Gate is a selective barrier that allows access based on verified safety.",
                "Walls are healthy, while Gates are a sign of codependency.",
                "There is no difference; both terms describe the same protective mechanism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recovery involves moving from 'Walls' (total shutdown/isolation) to 'Gates' (the ability to let safe people in while keeping unsafe people out through selective permeability)."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "During a 'Vulnerability Audit' (Lesson 5), what is the 'Rule of Three' used to assess?",
            "options": [
                "Whether a person can name three of your flaws.",
                "Whether a person has three mutual friends with you.",
                "Whether a person's words, actions, and values align consistently across three different contexts/environments.",
                "Whether a person can maintain a conversation for three hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vulnerability Audit looks for congruence. Trust is 'earned' when a person demonstrates the same character and values in private, in public, and under stress (three different contexts)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 addresses the 'Magnet Myth.' What is the actual mechanism that causes some survivors to find themselves in repeated narcissistic cycles?",
            "options": [
                "They possess a 'narcissist-attracting' pheromone.",
                "They have a 'porous filter'—the inability to identify and eject manipulators early due to normalized red flags.",
                "Narcissists have a psychic ability to find survivors.",
                "It is purely a matter of statistical bad luck."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Magnet Myth' is debunked by the understanding that survivors don't 'attract' narcissists more than others; rather, they may lack the 'ejection' mechanisms (boundaries/discernment) to remove them once they appear."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "The 'Slow-Dating Protocol' (Lesson 7) suggests a '90-Day Observation Window.' What is the scientific rationale for this duration?",
            "options": [
                "It takes 90 days for a person to legally become a partner.",
                "The 'representative' or 'mask' usually begins to slip between 60 to 90 days as the effort of impression management becomes unsustainable.",
                "Hormones like oxytocin disappear after exactly 90 days.",
                "90 days is the standard probationary period in most employment contracts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into impression management shows that most people can maintain a 'false' or idealized version of themselves for about 2-3 months before their natural behavioral patterns and triggers emerge."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Support Ecosystems' (Lesson 8), how is Interdependence distinguished from Codependence?",
            "options": [
                "Interdependence involves two people who never need each other for anything.",
                "Codependence is based on mutual growth; interdependence is based on mutual fear.",
                "Interdependence is a healthy 'we' where individual identities are preserved; codependence is a 'we' where identities are fused and boundaries are lost.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms describe a lack of independence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interdependence is the healthy middle ground where individuals support one another while maintaining their own autonomy and self-regulation, unlike the 'fused' and reactive nature of codependence."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client reports that their new partner is already talking about 'buying a house together' on the third date. Which manipulation marker from Lesson 2 does this represent?",
            "options": [
                "Future-Faking / Fast-Tracking",

                "Stonewalling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Fast-tracking or Future-faking involves creating an intense, premature sense of a shared future to bypass the natural stages of building trust and intimacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 1, what is the primary goal of the 'M' (Master Relational Discernment) phase of the recovery model?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the survivor never dates again.",
                "To shift from 'unconscious reactivity' to 'conscious selection' in all relationships.",
                "To learn how to manipulate a narcissist back.",
                "To forgive the abuser so that the survivor can move on."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastering discernment is about moving from a reactive state (where the survivor is chosen by others) to a proactive state (where the survivor consciously selects who is healthy enough to have access to their life)."
