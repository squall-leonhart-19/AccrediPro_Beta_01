            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for the 'craving' sensation during the narcissistic withdrawal phase, effectively mimicking the neurocircuitry of a substance use disorder?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine",
                "Serotonin",
                "GABA",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Dopamine drives the reward-seeking behavior and the intense 'craving' for the abuser during withdrawal, as the brain has been conditioned to seek the 'high' of reconciliation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Based on B.F. Skinner’s research on intermittent reinforcement, why is the 'Slot Machine' effect so difficult to break?",
            "options": [
                "The rewards are consistent and predictable.",
                "The lack of reward causes the subject to lose interest immediately.",
                "The unpredictability of the reward creates a persistent 'hope' that the next attempt will result in a win.",
                "The subject receives a reward every single time they perform a specific action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement creates a 'variable ratio schedule,' which is the most resistant to extinction because the survivor never knows which interaction will provide the 'hit' of affection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A survivor is struggling with Cognitive Dissonance, holding two conflicting versions of their partner: the 'Soulmate' and the 'Abuser.' What is the most effective clinical approach to dismantling this?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the survivor to focus only on the good memories to reduce stress.",
                "Helping the survivor realize that the 'Soulmate' was a calculated mask used to facilitate the abuse.",
                "Suggesting that both versions are equally true and must be accepted as 'balance.'",
                "Advocating for a confrontation with the abuser to seek the truth."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To resolve cognitive dissonance, the survivor must accept that the 'ideal' version was a tool for manipulation (the mask), rather than a separate, genuine personality."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A 2010 fMRI study by Helen Fisher and colleagues found that the brain activity of individuals experiencing a painful breakup (similar to narcissistic withdrawal) showed activation in the same regions associated with:",

                "Deep sleep and relaxation",
                "Physical pain and cocaine addiction withdrawal",
                "Mathematical problem solving",
                "Long-term memory storage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that the brain processes the end of a romantic bond (especially a high-intensity trauma bond) through the same neural pathways as physical pain and drug withdrawal."
        },

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Fawn' response (the 4th 'F' of trauma), what is the primary objective of the survivor's behavior?",
            "options": [
                "To physically fight back against the aggressor.",
                "To run away and find a safe location.",
                "To neutralize the threat by appeasing the abuser and merging with their needs.",
                "To play dead and hope the abuser loses interest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Fawn response is a survival strategy where the individual attempts to avoid conflict and ensure safety by becoming useful to, or compliant with, the abuser."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which hormone, often called the 'bonding hormone,' is released during physical touch or sexual intimacy and acts as a 'chemical glue' that makes leaving an abusive partner physically painful?",

                "Cortisol",
                "Oxytocin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin promotes bonding and trust; in an abusive cycle, it creates a powerful physiological attachment that overrides the survivor's logical knowledge of the danger."

                "A meditation focused on forgiving the abuser's childhood trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An 'Ick List' or 'Reality Log' serves as a factual anchor to counter the brain's tendency to 'euphoric recall' (remembering only the good times) during withdrawal."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "The shift from 'You-centered' thinking ('Why did they do this?') to 'I-centered' thinking ('What do I need right now?') represents a move toward:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional Sovereignty is the process of reclaiming one's internal locus of control and centering one's own needs and reality over the abuser's whims."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'savior complex' or the belief that the survivor is uniquely qualified to heal the abuser is a powerful emotional hook that maintains the bond."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "When a survivor experiences 'Adrenal Fatigue' or chronic exhaustion after leaving, it is often due to the long-term elevation of which hormone during the relationship?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress in an abusive relationship keeps cortisol levels high (the fight/flight state). Once the survivor leaves, the body often 'crashes' as the adrenal system attempts to recalibrate."
