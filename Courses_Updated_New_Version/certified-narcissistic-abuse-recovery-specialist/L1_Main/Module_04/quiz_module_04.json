            "question": "In Lesson 1, the term 'Perspecticide' is used to describe a specific outcome of identity erosion. What does this term fundamentally refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The physical isolation of a victim from their support network.",
                "The incapacity to know what one knows, leading to the collapse of one's own perspective of reality.",

                "A clinical diagnosis of permanent memory loss following emotional trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Perspecticide is the 'killing' of the victim's perspective, where the abuser's reality completely overrides the victim's ability to trust their own perceptions and judgments."

            "question": "When dismantling the 'Introject' (Lesson 2), what is the primary distinction between a survivor's natural 'Inner Critic' and a 'Narcissistic Introject'?",
            "options": [
                "The Inner Critic is always louder, while the Introject is a whisper.",
                "The Inner Critic uses the survivor's own voice, whereas the Introject often echoes the specific phrasing and tone of the abuser.",
                "The Introject is helpful for survival, while the Inner Critic is purely destructive.",
                "There is no distinction; they are clinical synonyms for the same psychological process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Introject is the internalized voice of the external abuser, often using their specific vocabulary, whereas the Inner Critic is an internal mechanism usually formed in childhood to keep the self safe."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to the principles of 'Reclaiming Agency' (Lesson 3), a survivor shifting from an 'External Locus of Control' to an 'Internal Locus of Control' would most likely say:",
            "options": [
                "'If I just act perfectly, they will finally stop being angry at me.'",
                "'My mood today depends entirely on whether I receive a text from my ex.'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An Internal Locus of Control involves recognizing personal agency and taking responsibility for one's own actions and reactions rather than being reactive to external forces."

                "A map is for recovery, while a compass is for the initial escape.",
                "Values are the compass (ongoing directions), while goals are the map (specific destinations).",
                "The narcissist provides the compass, and the survivor provides the map.",
                "Values are rigid like a map, while emotions are fluid like a compass."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Values are continuous directions (e.g., 'being honest'), whereas goals are specific points that can be 'checked off' (e.g., 'completing a course')."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intellectual sovereignty is the right to one's own thoughts and interpretations. Refusing to JADE demonstrates that the survivor no longer needs external validation for their internal truth."

            "options": [
                "Because it is a waste of time that survivors should avoid.",
                "Because narcissists often weaponized or mocked the victim's joy, making spontaneous play a reclamation of safety and self.",
                "Because play is only for children and helps survivors regress to an earlier age.",
                "Because it helps the survivor find a new partner more quickly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narcissistic abuse often involves the suppression of the victim's joy. Reclaiming play and hobbies is a direct way of excavating the authentic self that existed before the abuse."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Regarding 'Integration' (Lesson 8), research into Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) by Tedeschi and Calhoun suggests that survivors often report:",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PTG is not about returning to the 'pre-trauma' self, but integrating the experience to develop new strengths, deeper relationships, and a greater appreciation for life."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "Consider the case of 'Elena,' who feels intense guilt whenever she spends money on a hobby she enjoys because her ex-partner called her 'frivolous.' Which tool from Module 4 is most applicable here?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal of this module is integration—moving away from an identity built around surviving an abuser and toward an identity built on one's own internal values and desires."
