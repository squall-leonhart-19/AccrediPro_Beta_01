            "options": [
                "At least 3",
                "At least 5",
                "At least 7",
                "All 9"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DSM-5-TR requires a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy, indicated by at least five of the nine listed criteria beginning by early adulthood."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During the Idealization phase, what is the primary neurochemical driver that creates the 'addiction' to the narcissist in the victim?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin",
                "Cortisol",
                "Dopamine",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Love bombing triggers a massive release of dopamine, the brain's reward chemical. This creates a physiological 'high' that the victim later attempts to recapture during the devaluation phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, we discussed 'Intermittent Reinforcement.' Which psychological principle explains why victims find it so difficult to leave during the Devaluation phase?",

                "Avoidance learning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Variable-ratio schedules (like a slot machine) provide rewards at unpredictable intervals, which creates the strongest possible behavioral bond and makes the behavior most resistant to extinction."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client describes a situation where their partner denied saying something that was recorded on text, leading the client to question their own memory and sanity. This 'Psychological Anatomy of Confusion' is best described as which stage of Gaslighting?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stage 1 (Disbelief) occurs when the victim first encounters the distortion of reality and thinks the abuser is simply mistaken or confused, rather than intentionally manipulative."

                "High levels of genuine cognitive and affective empathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Covert narcissists (vulnerable narcissists) use a 'victim' identity to garner supply and are often hypersensitive to even slight perceived criticisms, whereas overt narcissists are more outwardly arrogant."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hoovering is a manipulation tactic used to 'suck' the victim back into the cycle. It is not about reconciliation but about re-establishing control and accessing supply."

                "To ensure the clinician's subjective interpretation doesn't overshadow the objective behavior",
                "To use as evidence in a criminal trial only",
                "To help the narcissist see what they said in future sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Verbatim documentation provides objective, behavioral evidence of manipulation and gaslighting, which helps the client (and the clinician) validate the reality of the abuse without subjective bias."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Trauma Bonding is chemically reinforced by the 'push-pull' of which two primary hormones/neurotransmitters?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'bond' is formed by Oxytocin (the bonding hormone released during 'good' times) and Cortisol (the stress hormone released during 'bad' times), creating a powerful biological attachment to the source of the stress."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
