                "Financial Independence",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physical safety is the foundational layer. Without a secure environment free from immediate threat, the nervous system remains in a state of hyper-vigilance, making psychological healing nearly impossible."

                "To allow the prefrontal cortex to regain regulation over an overactive amygdala",
                "To prove to the abuser that the survivor is independent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 90-day detox period is designed to break the 'trauma bond' by reducing the constant spikes of cortisol and adrenaline, allowing the prefrontal cortex (rational brain) to come back online."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client is co-parenting and must communicate regarding logistics. They find that being 'stone-cold' (Grey Rock) triggers more aggression from the abuser. Which strategy should you recommend?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yellow Rock adds a layer of superficial politeness (e.g., 'Hello,' 'Please,' 'Thank you') to Grey Rock. This is often more effective in legal or co-parenting situations as it prevents the survivor from appearing 'uncooperative' or 'hostile' in court."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stalkerware runs in the background and constantly transmits data (location, audio, etc.), which consumes significant battery power and causes the processor to run hot."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Freezing credit prevents the abuser from opening new accounts or taking out loans in the survivor's name, which is a common form of post-separation economic abuse."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Abusers often use 'manufactured crises' to bypass boundaries. Any response, even a negative one, reinforces the behavior. Silence is the only way to maintain the No Contact boundary."
