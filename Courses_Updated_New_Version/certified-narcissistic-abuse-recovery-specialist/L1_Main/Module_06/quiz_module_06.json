            "question": "In the context of the neurobiology of trauma, why do survivors of narcissistic abuse often experience 'fragmented' memories of the relationship?",
            "options": [
                "The prefrontal cortex becomes hyperactive, suppressing all emotional data.",
                "High cortisol levels during trauma impair the hippocampus's ability to sequence events chronologically.",
                "The amygdala shuts down entirely, preventing any emotional encoding of the events.",
                "Narcissistic abuse is generally not traumatic enough to trigger long-term memory storage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traumatic stress causes the amygdala to remain hyper-reactive while the hippocampus (responsible for chronological sequencing) is suppressed by cortisol, leading to fragmented, non-linear memories."

            "question": "A client consistently uses the phrase 'I am fundamentally unlovable'—a sentiment frequently expressed by their former partner. This is an example of which psychological mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "To erase the painful memories from the survivor's mind permanently.",
                "To convince the survivor that the abuse was actually a positive learning experience.",
                "To move memories from 'hot' emotional processing to 'cold' declarative processing through sequencing.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronological sequencing helps move traumatic memories from the reactive amygdala (hot) to the declarative hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (cold), reducing their emotional charge."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shame is identity-based (I am bad), whereas guilt is behavior-based (I did something bad). Narcissistic abuse typically installs toxic shame."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ambiguous loss occurs because the 'person' the survivor loved was a mask; they are mourning an idealized version of someone who is still physically present but psychologically 'absent' or non-existent."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Projective identification involves the abuser 'depositing' their unwanted traits into the survivor; recognizing this helps the survivor return those traits to the abuser."

                "The Thriver Narrative focuses on the survivor's agency and the integration of the trauma into a larger life story.",
                "The Thriver Narrative requires the survivor to have received a formal apology from the abuser.",
                "The Thriver Narrative is only possible if the survivor has entered a new, healthy relationship."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Thriver Narrative is characterized by agency—the survivor is the protagonist who has integrated the trauma, rather than being defined solely by the harm done to them."
