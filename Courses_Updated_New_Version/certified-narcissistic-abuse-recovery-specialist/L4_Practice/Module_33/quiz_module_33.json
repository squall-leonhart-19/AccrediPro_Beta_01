            "question": "Which of the following represents a critical boundary in the 'Scope of Practice' for a Narcissistic Abuse Recovery Specialist who is not a licensed mental health professional?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a formal DSM-5 diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) for the client's partner.",
                "Educating the client on the behavioral patterns of high-conflict personalities.",
                "Assisting the client in developing a safety plan for exiting an abusive relationship.",
                "Facilitating a peer-support group for survivors of emotional abuse."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Recovery Specialists must avoid clinical diagnosis. Even if a partner displays every trait of NPD, providing a formal diagnosis is a restricted activity reserved for licensed clinicians and can lead to legal charges of 'practicing medicine/psychology without a license.'"

            "question": "In 'Subpoena-Ready' documentation, which entry style is considered most defensible in a high-conflict family court setting?",
            "options": [
                "The client's husband is clearly a narcissist and was gaslighting her during the session.",
                "The client appeared very sad and seems to be suffering from complex PTSD.",
                "The client stated, 'He told me I was crazy five times this morning.' Client was weeping and trembling.",
                "The husband's behavior is indicative of a Cluster B personality disorder and he is dangerous."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective documentation relies on 'FACTS' (Factual, Accurate, Complete, Timely, and Specific). Using verbatim quotes and objective observations of physical behavior is more defensible than using clinical labels or subjective interpretations."

            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Duty to Warn' (Tarasoff principle) discussed in Lesson 3, when is a specialist legally or ethically obligated to breach confidentiality?",

                "When the specialist suspects the client is being gaslit by their attorney."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Duty to Warn' generally requires three elements: a specific, identifiable victim; a serious threat of physical violence; and the threat must be imminent. This is one of the few instances where confidentiality must be breached."

            "options": [
                "It is a violation of the specialist's First Amendment rights.",
                "It exceeds the scope of practice and can lead to the testimony being struck under the Daubert Standard.",
                "It is generally encouraged as long as the specialist has seen the client for more than six months.",
                "It helps the judge make a faster decision regarding the children's welfare."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Making custody recommendations is a specific forensic function usually reserved for court-appointed evaluators or Guardians ad Litem. Doing so as a recovery specialist is a role conflict and often inadmissible under evidentiary standards like Daubert."

                "The specialist's personal opinion on the client's ex-partner.",
                "A list of all other clients currently enrolled in the program for networking purposes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A robust 'Legal Disclaimer' in the informed consent is the first line of defense in risk management, clarifying that the specialist's role is not a licensed therapeutic or legal one."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Consultants provide 'work-product' that is often privileged and helps the legal strategy, whereas an expert witness provides testimony that is subject to cross-examination and public record."

            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "If a specialist receives a subpoena for client records in a high-conflict divorce case, what is the 'Ethical Documentation' protocol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A subpoena is a legal demand, but it does not automatically override client confidentiality. The specialist must follow a protocol of notification, consultation, and potentially filing a 'motion to quash' if the records are not legally relevant."
