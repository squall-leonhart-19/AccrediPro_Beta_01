            "question": "Which of the following best encapsulates the primary distinction of biblical treatment planning from secular approaches, as discussed in L1: Foundations?",
            "options": [
                "Its exclusive focus on behavioral modification through cognitive restructuring.",
                "Its reliance on empirical psychological research as the sole basis for interventions.",
                "Its foundational commitment to a Christ-centered, Scripture-saturated, and Holy Spirit-dependent process aimed at heart transformation.",
                "Its emphasis on client self-actualization and achieving personal happiness above all else."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biblical treatment planning, as covered in L1, is fundamentally distinct in its Christ-centered approach, its saturation in Scripture for diagnosis and remedy, and its reliance on the Holy Spirit to effect genuine heart transformation, rather than merely behavioral adjustments or self-focused goals."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When crafting biblically aligned goals for a client struggling with anxiety (L2: Crafting Biblically Aligned Goals), a coach helps the client set a goal to 'regularly practice biblical meditation on Philippians 4:6-7 for 10 minutes daily, seeking God's peace, and reporting progress weekly.' This goal best exemplifies which characteristic of a 'SPIRITUAL' goal?",
            "options": [
                "Specific and Self-serving",
                "Practical and Passive",
                "Scriptural and Sustainable",
                "Specific, Prayerful, and Invested"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L2, biblically aligned goals should be 'SPIRITUAL'. This example is 'Specific' (10 minutes daily, Philippians 4:6-7), 'Prayerful' (seeking God's peace), and 'Invested' (client reporting progress, actively engaging). While 'Scriptural' and 'Sustainable' are also relevant, 'Specific, Prayerful, and Invested' most directly aligns with the structure provided."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "During the 'Observe & Orient' phase (L3: Developing Scriptural Interventions), a coach notes that a client, 'Sarah,' consistently expresses feelings of worthlessness despite clear biblical teaching on her identity in Christ. What is the most crucial step for the coach at this juncture?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately provide her with a list of verses to memorize without further exploration.",
                "Challenge her beliefs directly and demand immediate repentance.",
                "Seek to understand the underlying false beliefs, past wounds, or unconfessed sin contributing to her self-perception, using Scripture to orient her worldview.",
                "Refer her to a secular therapist for self-esteem building techniques."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L3 emphasizes that 'Observe & Orient' involves deep listening and discernment to understand the client's narrative, worldview, and spiritual condition. For Sarah, this means exploring the roots of her worthlessness and using Scripture to help her re-orient her understanding of herself in light of God's truth, rather than superficial fixes or immediate confrontation."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client, 'Mark,' is struggling with chronic anger. In the 'Relate & Renew' phase (L4: Implementing Transformative Interventions), which intervention would be most aligned with fostering genuine heart change and obedience?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting he count to ten before responding in anger.",
                "Encouraging him to identify specific triggers and avoid them completely.",
                "Guiding him through confession of anger as sin, exploring the idols behind it, and committing to cultivate patience and self-control through prayer and reliance on the Holy Spirit.",
                "Prescribing a strict diet and exercise regimen to reduce stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L4 stresses that 'Relate & Renew' moves beyond behavioral management to address the heart. Guiding Mark to confess sin, identify idols, and rely on the Holy Spirit for fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) directly targets the root issues of anger and aligns with biblical principles of sanctification."

            "question": "A client frequently misses coaching sessions and offers excuses, demonstrating significant <span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span> (L5: Addressing Obstacles and Resistance). As a biblical coach, what is the most appropriate initial response?",
            "options": [
                "Terminate the coaching relationship immediately due to lack of commitment.",
                "Increase the intensity of scriptural confrontation to motivate them.",
                "Prayerfully and gently explore the underlying reasons for the resistance, such as fear, misunderstanding, or secondary gain, and clarify the purpose of coaching.",
                "Ignore the missed sessions and hope the client eventually becomes more engaged."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L5 highlights that resistance often stems from deeper issues. A biblical coach should respond with grace, patience, and prayerful discernment, seeking to understand the root causes of resistance rather than reacting punitively or dismissively. Clarifying expectations and offering gentle confrontation can be part of this process."

            "question": "According to L6: Documentation, Ethics, and Scope of Practice, a Certified Biblical Counseling Coach discovers that their client, 'David,' is experiencing severe auditory hallucinations and expresses suicidal ideation. What is the coach's primary ethical responsibility in this situation?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the frequency of biblical coaching sessions to provide more spiritual support.",
                "Refer David immediately to a licensed mental health professional and potentially emergency services, while maintaining appropriate spiritual care within their scope.",
                "Attempt to diagnose David's condition and prescribe spiritual remedies for his hallucinations.",
                "Document the symptoms but continue coaching as usual, believing prayer alone will suffice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L6 explicitly addresses the scope of practice and ethical boundaries. A biblical coach is not equipped to handle severe mental health crises or diagnose clinical conditions. The ethical and responsible action is to refer to appropriate licensed professionals (e.g., psychiatrist, therapist, emergency services) while continuing to offer spiritual support within the defined coaching scope, if appropriate and safe."

            "question": "Which method is LEAST effective for monitoring a client's progress in developing biblical virtues like patience or self-control (L7: Monitoring Progress and Adapting the Plan)?",
            "options": [
                "Utilizing a subjective self-assessment scale where the client rates their daily experience of the virtue.",
                "Observing noticeable changes in the client's responses to challenging situations, reported by the client or trusted accountability partners.",
                "Relying solely on the coach's intuition about whether the client is improving.",
                "Tracking the client's consistent engagement in spiritual disciplines aimed at cultivating the virtue (e.g., daily prayer, Scripture meditation)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L7 emphasizes objective and systematic ways to monitor progress. Relying solely on intuition is subjective and lacks measurable data. More effective methods include client self-reports, observable behavioral changes, and tracking engagement in specific, virtue-building spiritual disciplines."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "As a client successfully completes their biblical coaching plan, L8: Integrating Community and Transitioning to Discipleship, highlights the importance of transitioning them into ongoing discipleship. What is a key component of this transition?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to become fully independent of all spiritual guidance.",
                "Developing a 'discipleship exit plan' that connects the client to a local church, small group, or mature Christian mentor for continued growth.",
                "Immediately assigning the client to coach others, regardless of their readiness.",
                "Ending the relationship abruptly to foster self-reliance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L8 stresses that biblical coaching is not an end in itself but a stepping stone to sustained spiritual growth within the body of Christ. A key component is to intentionally transition the client by connecting them with a supportive Christian community (local church, small group) or a mentor, ensuring continued discipleship and accountability."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A client, 'Maria,' struggles with chronic resentment towards her estranged sister. After the 'Observe & Orient' phase reveals deep-seated bitterness and a distorted view of forgiveness, the coach moves to 'Relate & Renew'. Which intervention best integrates both phases for transformative change?",
            "options": [
                "Simply telling Maria to 'forgive and forget' without further guidance.",
                "Focusing only on behavioral changes, like avoiding contact with her sister.",
                "Guiding Maria to confess her bitterness as sin, meditate on biblical passages about forgiveness (e.g., Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 3:13), and pray for her sister, while processing the emotional pain in light of Christ's sacrifice.",
                "Suggesting Maria write an angry letter to her sister to vent her feelings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This intervention effectively bridges 'Observe & Orient' (understanding the deep-seated bitterness and distorted view) with 'Relate & Renew' (applying biblical truth). It involves confession, scriptural meditation, prayer, and processing emotions through a biblical lens, fostering genuine heart change and obedience to God's command to forgive."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A biblical coach is working with 'John,' who reports a significant improvement in his spiritual disciplines and a reduction in his presenting issue. However, he now expresses an interest in exploring past traumatic memories related to childhood abuse, which were not part of the initial coaching goals. According to L6: Documentation, Ethics, and Scope of Practice, what is the most appropriate action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage John to delve deeply into these memories during their next session, as he is showing trust.",
                "Acknowledge John's desire but explain that this area falls outside the scope of biblical coaching and refer him to a trauma-informed licensed therapist for specialized care.",
                "Provide John with a list of self-help books on trauma and suggest he work through them independently.",
                "Tell John that focusing on the past is unbiblical and he should only look forward."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L6 clearly delineates the scope of practice for a biblical coach. While a coach can offer spiritual support, addressing deep-seated trauma requires specialized training and licensure. The most ethical and responsible action is to refer John to a qualified trauma-informed licensed therapist, recognizing the limits of the coaching role."
