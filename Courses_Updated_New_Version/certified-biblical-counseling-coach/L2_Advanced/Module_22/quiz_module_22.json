            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L1 emphasizes that while secular ethical guidelines and personal conviction can be helpful, the foundational and ultimate source of ethical principles for a biblical coach is the infallible Word of God."

            "options": [
                "Maintain strict confidentiality as promised to Sarah.",
                "Immediately contact Sarah's family without her consent.",
                "Assess the immediacy and severity of the threat and intervene as necessary, which may include breaking confidentiality to ensure her safety.",
                "Advise Sarah to pray about it and trust God for protection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L2 on Confidentiality and Trust highlights that the duty to protect a client from harm, or others from a client, supersedes strict confidentiality. In cases of imminent self-harm, the coach must assess the threat and take necessary steps, which often involves breaking confidentiality to ensure safety, adhering to legal and ethical mandates."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L3 on Dual Relationships and Conflicts of Interest strongly advises against entering into coaching relationships where significant pre-existing relationships exist. Such dual relationships can impair objectivity, exploit the client, and complicate the coaching process. A referral to another competent coach is the most ethical choice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L4 emphasizes the importance of Competence and Scope of Practice. Biblical coaches are not licensed mental health professionals and should not attempt to diagnose or treat severe mental illnesses. The ethical responsibility is to recognize the limits of one's competence and refer to appropriate specialists, while still offering biblical support within their scope."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L6 on Professionalism and Accountability stresses the importance of humility, continuous learning, and responsiveness to feedback. An ethical coach uses feedback as an opportunity for growth, seeking guidance from supervisors or mentors to refine their skills and better serve clients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L7 on Ethical Considerations in Technology and Remote Counseling emphasizes the need for enhanced security measures in online interactions.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario tests the limits of confidentiality discussed in L2. If there is no ongoing threat of harm to self or others, and no legal mandate to report a past crime, the coach's ethical duty is to maintain confidentiality while biblically addressing the client's sin, repentance, and restoration in a safe and supportive environment."
