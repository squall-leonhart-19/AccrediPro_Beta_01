            "question": "During the 'Welcome & Witness' phase, a client presents with intense anxiety and expresses a belief that 'God is punishing me.' Which advanced spiritual discernment technique is most appropriate for the biblical counseling coach to employ initially?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately challenge the client's belief as unbiblical to reframe their perspective.",
                "Engage in active listening and empathetic reflection, while prayerfully discerning potential spiritual strongholds or misinterpretations of God's character.",
                "Refer the client directly to a psychiatrist, as anxiety with spiritual overtones is outside the scope of biblical counseling.",
                "Share a personal testimony of overcoming similar anxiety to build immediate rapport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced spiritual discernment begins with compassionate listening and prayer. It's crucial to first understand the client's perspective and emotional state before attempting to reframe or challenge beliefs, allowing the Holy Spirit to guide the discernment process regarding spiritual strongholds versus psychological distress."

            "question": "A client consistently struggles with chronic anger outbursts, impacting their marriage and work. Through advanced biblical assessment, the coach identifies a pattern of self-righteousness and a deep-seated fear of losing control. According to the 'Unpacking Root Causes' lesson, what is the most critical next step after identifying these root issues?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe a strict daily regimen of Bible verses on anger management.",
                "Focus exclusively on behavioral modification techniques to stop the outbursts.",
                "Help the client trace these root issues to their underlying unbiblical belief systems and heart idols, using tools like a theological genogram to understand origins.",
                "Advise immediate marital separation to reduce conflict exposure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Unpacking Root Causes' lesson emphasizes moving beyond symptoms to identify the heart issues and unbiblical belief systems that fuel destructive patterns. Tracing these roots, often with assessment tools, provides the foundation for biblical re-framing and repentance, as opposed to merely addressing superficial behaviors."

            "question": "In 'Orienting to God's Truth,' a coach is working with a client who believes 'I must be perfect to earn God's love.' Which approach best exemplifies gentle yet firm confrontation and re-framing of this unbiblical belief?",
            "options": [
                "Directly state, 'That belief is wrong; the Bible says God loves you unconditionally.'",
                "Ask, 'How has striving for perfection impacted your relationship with God and others? Let's explore what Scripture teaches about grace and God's unmerited favor.'",
                "Ignore the belief for now and focus on other presenting issues.",
                "Suggest the client read a book on self-esteem to build their confidence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle yet firm confrontation involves both questioning the impact of the unbiblical belief and immediately orienting the client to God's truth through Scripture. This invites the client to participate in the discovery of biblical truth rather than simply being told, fostering genuine re-framing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SMART framework requires objectives to be specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-bound. Option C clearly outlines what the client will do, how much, for how long, and connects it to a spiritual goal (cultivating wisdom and discipline), making it an effective discipleship plan component."

            "question": "A client presents with symptoms consistent with Complex PTSD due to childhood abuse, alongside deep spiritual questions about God's goodness. In 'Navigating Complex Cases,' how should the biblical counseling coach best apply the W.O.R.D. framework?",
            "options": [
                "Address only the spiritual questions, assuring the client that the trauma will resolve with prayer.",
                "Refer the client immediately for psychiatric medication and cease biblical counseling.",

                "Encourage the client to simply forgive their abuser without processing the emotional impact of the trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Navigating complex cases like trauma requires a holistic approach.

A multidisciplinary approach, where biblical counseling complements professional therapy, often yields the best outcomes."

            "question": "A client struggling with a long-term pornography addiction consistently repents but quickly relapses. According to the 'Navigating Complex Cases' lesson, what is a crucial aspect of applying the W.O.R.D. framework to this addiction, beyond simply confronting the sin?",
            "options": [
                "Focus solely on willpower and self-control, encouraging the client to try harder.",
                "Recognize the multifaceted nature of addiction, identifying underlying idols, spiritual bondage, potential co-occurring mental health issues, and the need for robust accountability and community support beyond individual counseling.",

            "explanation": "The advanced application of the W.O.R.D. framework to addiction recognizes that it's often a complex interplay of idolatry, spiritual bondage, psychological factors, and learned behaviors. Effective intervention requires identifying these underlying issues, establishing strong accountability, building supportive community, and potentially integrating with other professional resources, rather than solely relying on willpower."
