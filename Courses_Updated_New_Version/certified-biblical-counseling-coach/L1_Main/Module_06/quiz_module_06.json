            "question": "A client, Sarah, expresses persistent anxiety about her career future, despite having a stable job. She frequently compares herself to others and feels a deep sense of inadequacy. According to Lesson L1, 'The Nuance of Observation,' what might be a complex spiritual root underlying her presenting anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of proper financial planning.",
                "An idol of control and approval, rooted in self-worth tied to performance.",
                "Insufficient self-care practices leading to burnout.",
                "A simple need for career counseling and skill development."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson L1 emphasizes discerning complex spiritual roots beyond superficial symptoms. Sarah's anxiety, comparison, and inadequacy, despite stability, strongly suggest an underlying idol of control and approval, where her worth is derived from external achievements rather than her identity in Christ."

            "question": "When counseling a client through profound suffering, a biblical coach should primarily orient them to God's sovereignty. Which statement best reflects the biblical understanding of God's sovereignty in suffering, as discussed in Lesson L2?",
            "options": [
                "God directly causes all suffering to punish sin.",
                "God is entirely removed from human suffering, allowing free will to dictate all outcomes.",
                "God, in His sovereign wisdom, permits suffering for His purposes, often to refine faith and reveal His glory, without always being the direct cause of evil.",
                "Suffering is a random event with no divine purpose or meaning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L2 clarifies that God's sovereignty in suffering means He permits it for ultimate good and His purposes, even if He is not the direct author of evil. This perspective offers hope and meaning, distinguishing it from simplistic punitive views or fatalism."

            "question": "According to Lesson L3 on facilitating genuine repentance, what is the key distinction between 'worldly sorrow' and 'godly sorrow' as described in 2 Corinthians 7:10?",
            "options": [
                "Worldly sorrow leads to self-pity, while godly sorrow focuses on the harm caused to others.",
                "Worldly sorrow is a superficial regret of consequences, whereas godly sorrow leads to genuine change and salvation.",
                "Worldly sorrow is felt by non-believers, and godly sorrow by believers.",
                "Worldly sorrow is expressed emotionally, while godly sorrow is purely intellectual."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson L3 highlights 2 Corinthians 7:10, explaining that worldly sorrow is often regret over being caught or facing consequences, leading to death (despair), while godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance and salvation, prompting a change of heart and action."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client consistently prioritizes their comfort and ease above all else, making decisions solely based on avoiding discomfort or inconvenience, even when it conflicts with biblical principles. According to Lesson L4, 'Confronting Idolatry and Unbiblical Worldviews,' what modern idol is most likely at play here?",
            "options": [
                "The idol of intellect.",
                "The idol of productivity.",

                "The idol of social status."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L4 defines idolatry broadly, extending beyond physical idols to include anything that takes precedence over God in our hearts. Prioritizing comfort and ease above all else, even biblical principles, is a clear manifestation of the idol of comfort."

            "question": "In the 'Relate & Renew' methodology (Lesson L5), a coach is working with a client struggling with unforgiveness. After actively listening and empathizing (Relate phase), which action best exemplifies the 'Renew' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting the client vent their frustrations further to feel heard.",
                "Providing a detailed psychological analysis of the client's past trauma.",
                "Guiding the client to relevant Scriptures on forgiveness, such as Colossians 3:13 or Matthew 18:21-35, and discussing practical steps for application.",
                "Advising the client to simply 'move on' without addressing the root issue biblically."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Renew' phase of the 'Relate & Renew' methodology involves bringing God's truth to bear on the client's situation. Guiding them to specific, relevant Scriptures and discussing practical application is the core of this phase, offering biblical solutions and hope."

                "To earn God's favor and secure salvation through good works.",
                "To demonstrate one's superior spiritual maturity to others.",

                "To temporarily escape worldly problems and responsibilities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L6 teaches that spiritual disciplines are not about earning salvation, but about creating space and opening ourselves to God's work. They are means of grace through which the Holy Spirit transforms us from the inside out, fostering spiritual growth and conformity to Christ."

            "question": "When counseling a client experiencing intense grief after the sudden loss of a loved one (Lesson L7), what is the most appropriate initial biblical coaching response?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately tell them that 'everything happens for a reason' to reassure them.",
                "Encourage them to suppress their emotions and focus only on positive thoughts.",
                "Sit with them in their pain, listen empathetically, acknowledge their sorrow, and gently point to God's presence and comfort in suffering (e.g., Psalm 34:18).",
                "Suggest they quickly find a new hobby to distract themselves from their sadness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L7, 'Counseling Through Grief, Loss, and Trauma,' stresses the importance of empathetic presence and acknowledging pain. Offering trite answers or minimizing suffering is unhelpful. The initial response should be to lament with the client, listen, and gently remind them of God's comforting presence and hope, rather than immediate solutions."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson L8, 'Ethical Practice and Self-Care,' a biblical coach discovers that a client they are actively counseling is also a close personal friend seeking advice on unrelated matters. What ethical principle is most at risk, and what is the best course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Confidentiality; the coach should continue both relationships but keep them separate.",
                "Competence; the coach should refer the friend to another coach for counseling.",
                "Dual relationships/Boundaries; the coach should refer the friend to another biblical coach for formal counseling to maintain professional boundaries and objectivity.",
                "Self-care; the coach should continue counseling the friend as it's less work than finding a new client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L8 explicitly addresses the importance of professional boundaries and avoiding dual relationships. Counseling a close friend creates a conflict of interest that compromises objectivity and the counseling relationship. The ethical choice is to refer the friend to another qualified coach."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client expresses persistent bitterness towards a family member, stating, 'They don't deserve my forgiveness, and I don't feel like forgiving them.' Based on insights from Lessons L3 and L4, what underlying unbiblical worldview or idol might be contributing to this stance?",
            "options": [
                "An over-reliance on emotional intuition rather than biblical command regarding forgiveness.",
                "The belief that forgiveness is earned rather than a choice and command.",
                "An idol of justice or personal vindication, where the client desires the offender to suffer.",
                "All of the above."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "This scenario touches on multiple concepts. The client's reliance on 'feeling like' forgiving (emotional intuition), the belief that forgiveness must be 'deserved' (not a choice), and the desire for the other person to suffer (idol of justice/vindication) all represent unbiblical worldviews and potential idols addressed in Lessons L3 and L4, hindering genuine forgiveness."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "In a situation involving a client who has experienced significant trauma, Lesson L7 highlights the importance of offering biblical hope without minimizing their pain. Which approach aligns best with this principle?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on the client's past trauma and its psychological effects without introducing spiritual truths.",
                "Immediately quoting Romans 8:28 ('all things work together for good') without acknowledging their current suffering.",
                "Acknowledging their profound pain and loss, sitting with them in their grief, and gently reminding them of God's character (e.g., His faithfulness, comfort, and ultimate redemption) over time, as the Holy Spirit leads.",
                "Suggesting that their trauma is a direct consequence of unconfessed sin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L7 emphasizes a compassionate and patient approach to trauma. While acknowledging pain is crucial, offering hope is also vital. This is done by gently reminding the client of God's steadfast character and promises, allowing the Holy Spirit to bring comfort and perspective, rather than immediately offering simplistic theological answers or blaming the victim."
