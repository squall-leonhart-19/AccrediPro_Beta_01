            "question": "A new client presents to biblical counseling exhibiting severe anxiety and expressing passive suicidal ideation, stating, \"I just wish I wasn't here anymore.\" According to best practices in the 'Welcome & Witness' phase for crisis cases, what is the <em>immediate</em> priority?",
            "options": [
                "Establishing a safety plan and ensuring the client is not an immediate danger to themselves.",
                "Immediately presenting the full Gospel message to offer hope.",

                "Scheduling a follow-up session to allow the client to calm down."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In crisis situations, especially with suicidal ideation, the immediate priority is always client safety and risk assessment. The Gospel is foundational, but safety must be established first to create a secure environment for ministry."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A client consistently seeks validation from their professional achievements, experiencing severe despair and self-worth crises whenever they face a setback at work, despite having a supportive family and strong faith community. This pattern aligns most closely with the identification of what concept in advanced biblical assessment?",
            "options": [
                "A deeply rooted personality disorder.",
                "An external locus of control.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The client's disproportionate despair tied to professional achievements, even with other areas of stability, indicates that their self-worth is being derived from something other than God, pointing to an 'idol of the heart'."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "When a client demonstrates consistent resistance to acknowledging their own contribution to relational conflicts, repeatedly blaming others, what is the most biblically sound strategy for <span class=\"highlight\">gentle confrontation</span>?",
            "options": [
                "Directly rebuking their sin and demanding immediate repentance.",
                "Ignoring the resistance and focusing on external circumstances.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle confrontation involves patiently guiding the client to see truth for themselves through questions and scripture, rather than aggressive rebuke or avoidance. This aligns with Galatians 6:1."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biblical counseling acknowledges the reality of chronic suffering and provides a framework for lament (e.g., Psalms) while steadfastly pointing to God's character and future hope, rather than demanding healing or attributing suffering to specific sin."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While psychological factors can play a role, sudden, intense, and recurring temptations or feelings of oppression after spiritual progress often indicate spiritual warfare, requiring a focus on prayer, scripture, and other spiritual disciplines for endurance."

            "explanation": "To maintain professional integrity and avoid the complexities and potential harm of a dual relationship, it is best practice to refer close friends or family members to another qualified counselor, even if an initial brief assessment is done."

                "Immediately offering platitudes like \"God has a plan\" to comfort them.",
