            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biblical diagnosis, as outlined in 'Discerning the Heart,' seeks to go beyond surface symptoms to discern the root heart issues (Proverbs 4:23) that drive unbiblical thoughts, emotions, and behaviors."

            "question": "A counselee consistently interprets neutral situations negatively, believing 'nothing ever goes right for me' and 'I'm always going to fail.'

            "explanation": "A biblical theology of suffering acknowledges that God sovereignly uses trials for good, including sanctification, drawing us closer to Him, and glorifying His name, rather than it being solely punitive or meaningless."

            "question": "A counselee, Mark, reports severe anxiety before public speaking, often leading to panic attacks. During intake, you learn he was harshly criticized by a teacher in his youth and now avoids all situations requiring public performance. He also expresses a desire for others' approval above all else. Based on Module 2, what would be the most integrated initial observation and orientation?",
            "options": [
                "Mark needs to simply practice public speaking more to overcome his fear.",
                "Mark's anxiety is solely a psychological issue requiring only secular cognitive-behavioral techniques.",
                "Mark's anxiety is a symptom potentially rooted in a fear of man (idolatry of approval) and an unbiblical thought pattern of catastrophizing, which needs to be oriented towards biblical truth about God's approval and sovereignty.",
                "Mark should be told his anxiety is not sinful and needs no further exploration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This option correctly integrates several module concepts: identifying a symptom (anxiety), discerning potential root heart issues (fear of man/idolatry of approval), recognizing unbiblical thought patterns (catastrophizing), and orienting towards biblical truth (God's approval, sovereignty)."

            "explanation": "The module's title 'Observe & Orient' directly reflects this goal: to deeply observe and understand (diagnose) the counselee's situation biblically, and then orient them towards the truth and sufficiency of Scripture for transformation."
