            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biblical repentance involves a holistic change – a change of mind (metanoia), heart, and direction, leading to transformed actions, not just emotional regret or intellectual assent. It signifies a foundational shift in allegiance."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
