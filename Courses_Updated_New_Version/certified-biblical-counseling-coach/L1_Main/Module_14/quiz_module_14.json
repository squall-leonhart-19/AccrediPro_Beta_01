This moves beyond superficial remedies to heart-level change."

            "explanation": "Biblical repentance involves a fundamental, God-given change in one's thinking, affections, and actions, resulting in a conscious turning from sin and toward God in faith, not merely regret or intellectual assent. It is an ongoing process in the Christian life."

            ],

During the <span class=\"highlight\">'Welcome & Witness' (W) and 'Observe & Orient' (O) stages</span>, the coach learned Sarah consistently prioritized career advancement over spiritual growth and relational health. Based on Lesson 5's emphasis on identifying root issues, what might the coach initially observe as a potential idol of Sarah's heart?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing career advancement and material success over spiritual and relational health, especially when leading to chronic dissatisfaction, strongly suggests an idol of achievement or worldly success. This is a common root issue identified in biblical assessment, where a good thing has become an ultimate thing."

In the 'Orient & Observe' (O) and 'Relate & Renew' (R) stages, the biblical coach aims to apply God's truth to these feelings. Which biblical concept, applied through specific Scriptures like Ephesians 2:10 or 2 Corinthians 5:17, would be most effective for <span class=\"highlight\">orienting and renewing</span> this client's self-perception?",
