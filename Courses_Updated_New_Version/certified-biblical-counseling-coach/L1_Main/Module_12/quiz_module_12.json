            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'W' in WORD, 'Welcome & Witness,' is dedicated to cultivating a Christ-centered relationship, establishing rapport, and creating a safe environment where the counselee feels heard and understood, laying the groundwork for effective biblical coaching."

            "options": [
                "Immediately prescribing specific Bible verses for their problem.",

                "Referring them to a medical professional for all mental health concerns."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in WORD emphasizes a thorough biblical assessment to discern the underlying spiritual and heart issues (root causes) rather than just surface-level symptoms or external factors. This involves active listening and strategic questioning to orient the coach to the counselee's true condition."

            "options": [
                "All suffering is a direct consequence of personal sin.",
                "Suffering is always a sign of God's displeasure and punishment.",
                "Suffering can stem from a fallen world, the sin of others, personal sin, or God's sovereign purposes for growth and glory.",
                "True believers should never experience suffering."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The biblical perspective on suffering is multifaceted, acknowledging that it can arise from various sources including the general brokenness of a fallen world, the sinful actions of others, our own specific sins, or as part of God's sovereign plan to refine us and display His glory, as seen in passages like Romans 8:28 and John 9:1-3."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When addressing anxiety and fear from a biblical perspective, what is a key distinction made between healthy fear and sinful anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "Healthy fear is always irrational, while sinful anxiety is rational.",
                "Healthy fear respects real danger and prompts wise action; sinful anxiety is rooted in a lack of trust in God's sovereignty and provision.",
                "Healthy fear is only experienced by non-believers, while sinful anxiety is exclusive to Christians.",
                "There is no biblical distinction; all fear and anxiety are sinful."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biblically, a healthy fear (reverence, caution) acknowledges genuine threats and God's power, prompting wise responses. Sinful anxiety, however, is characterized by worry and a lack of trust in God's control and care, often manifesting as an attempt to control outcomes that are beyond our grasp, directly challenging biblical commands to 'not be anxious' (Philippians 4:6-7)."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A core doctrinal foundation for biblical coaching is 'Bibliology.' What does this doctrine affirm regarding the Bible?",
            "options": [
                "The Bible is a helpful guide but requires modern psychological insights to be fully effective.",
                "The Bible is primarily a historical document with some moral teachings.",
                "The Bible is the inspired, inerrant, authoritative, and sufficient Word of God for all matters of life and godliness.",
                "The Bible contains some truth but is mostly allegorical and symbolic."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bibliology, as a core doctrinal foundation for biblical coaching, asserts the Bible's divine inspiration, absolute truthfulness (inerrancy), ultimate authority, and complete adequacy (sufficiency) to address all human problems from God's perspective, guiding believers in every aspect of life (2 Timothy 3:16-17)."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A counselee struggles with persistent sinful anger, often lashing out at family members. According to biblical approaches to anger, what is often identified as a primary root cause of such anger?",
            "options": [
                "A low self-esteem that needs affirmation.",
                "Unmet demands or idolatrous desires for control, comfort, or approval.",
                "A chemical imbalance in the brain that requires medication.",
                "A lack of assertiveness in expressing their needs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biblical teaching on sinful anger often points to unmet demands or idolatrous desires as its root. When individuals place excessive importance on their own desires for control, comfort, or approval, and these desires are thwarted, anger can erupt (James 4:1-3)."

            "id": "q12_7",

            "options": [
                "Blindly quoting verses without context or explanation.",
                "Focusing solely on immediate behavioral modification without addressing heart issues.",
                "Carefully interpreting Scripture (hermeneutics) and applying it specifically to the counselee's unique situation, guiding them toward repentance and faith-driven change.",
                "Encouraging the counselee to simply read the Bible more without specific guidance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in WORD emphasizes the skillful and prayerful application of God's Word. This involves sound hermeneutics to understand the Scripture's original meaning and then thoughtfully relating it to the counselee's specific struggles, fostering genuine repentance, renewed thinking, and practical steps of faith."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "A biblical coach is working with a client exhibiting symptoms of severe clinical depression. While employing the WORD Framework™, what is a responsible and biblically sound approach for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "To tell the client that depression is purely a spiritual issue and only prayer is needed.",
                "To advise the client to stop any prescribed medication immediately.",
                "To integrate biblical truth with a recommendation for professional medical evaluation and potential collaboration with medical professionals, recognizing the complexity of human suffering.",
                "To ignore the physical symptoms and focus exclusively on past sins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A biblically sound approach acknowledges the holistic nature of humanity (spirit, soul, body). While biblical truth is sufficient for spiritual transformation, responsible biblical coaches recognize that complex issues like severe clinical depression may have physiological components and may require medical intervention alongside spiritual care. Collaboration with medical professionals, where appropriate, is often a wise and compassionate approach, as emphasized in the AccrediPro standards."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT considered a primary characteristic of biblical counseling, as introduced in the 'Introduction to Biblical Counseling' lesson?",
            "options": [
                "It is Christ-centered and Spirit-dependent.",
                "It views the Bible as the authoritative and sufficient guide.",
                "It primarily relies on human wisdom and secular psychological theories.",
                "It aims for heart change leading to godly living."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biblical counseling fundamentally distinguishes itself by its reliance on the sufficiency and authority of Scripture, its Christ-centered focus, and its dependence on the Holy Spirit for true change. It does not primarily rely on human wisdom or secular psychological theories, though it may acknowledge common grace insights that align with biblical truth."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "When a counselee expresses persistent bitterness towards someone who wronged them, what foundational biblical principle should the coach guide them towards?",
            "options": [
                "Seeking revenge to achieve justice.",
                "Suppressing their feelings and pretending the hurt didn't happen.",
                "Understanding and practicing biblical forgiveness, which involves releasing the right to get even and trusting God with justice.",
                "Waiting for the offender to apologize before any healing can begin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biblical approaches to bitterness emphasize forgiveness, not as condoning the offense, but as an act of obedience to God that releases the wronged party from the bondage of resentment and frees them from the need for personal retribution, entrusting justice to God (Colossians 3:13, Ephesians 4:32). This is a crucial step towards spiritual and emotional healing."
