            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 highlights that effective initial assessment goes beyond surface-level symptoms.

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 explains that 'Observe & Orient' moves beyond presenting problems to a biblical assessment of the heart. The goal is to understand the client's motivations, beliefs, and desires in light of Scripture, identifying how these contribute to their struggles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "explanation": "Lesson 3 emphasizes ethical boundaries. Biblical coaches must recognize the limits of their expertise and refer clients to licensed professionals when issues fall outside their scope, especially for severe mental health conditions requiring medical or clinical intervention. Collaborative care is often the most compassionate and effective approach."
