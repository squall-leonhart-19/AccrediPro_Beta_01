            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in the W.O.R.D. Framework™ stands for Observe, emphasizing the coach's role in carefully noticing the client's behaviors, emotions, and circumstances to gain a deeper understanding before intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A biblical coach must recognize the limits of their scope of practice. When a client presents with severe mental health crises like active suicidal ideation, the ethical and professional responsibility is to refer them immediately to licensed mental health professionals who are equipped to handle such emergencies."

            "explanation": "Prayer is a vital component of biblical coaching, but it should be introduced respectfully.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Christ-centered environment is characterized by grace, truth, and safety.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Discerning a client's spiritual foundation requires a gentle, inquisitive approach. The goal is to understand their existing worldview, beliefs, and relationship with God, creating a bridge for relating biblical truth rather than immediately confronting perceived errors."

            "question": "A new client, David, asks his biblical coach if they can meet for coffee outside of scheduled sessions to 'just chat informally about life.' How should the coach best respond while maintaining professional boundaries?",
            "options": [

                "Gently decline, explaining that coaching interactions occur within the structured session framework to maintain focus, professionalism, and clear boundaries.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining clear professional boundaries is crucial in biblical coaching. Informal meetings outside of structured sessions can blur the lines of the coaching relationship, potentially leading to dual relationships or misunderstandings. It's best to politely decline and reinforce the established coaching structure."

                "Directing the client to confess all past sins immediately.",
                "Delegating the client's problems to other church members for support.",

                "Dismissing any client concerns that seem trivial or unspiritual."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'D' in W.O.R.D. stands for Discern. This involves seeking God's wisdom through prayer and Scripture to understand the root issues, identify unbiblical patterns, and guide the client toward God-honoring, practical steps for transformation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While confidentiality is a cornerstone of the coaching relationship, it is not absolute. Biblical coaches, like other helping professionals, operate within ethical and legal frameworks that mandate reporting in specific situations, such as credible threats of harm to self or others, or child/elder abuse. These exceptions must be clearly communicated to the client upfront."
