            "explanation": "L2 teaches that the biblical 'heart' encompasses the entirety of a person's inner being—their intellect, emotions, will, and conscience—serving as the control center from which all life flows. It is not limited to mere emotions or the physical organ."

                "To ensure the client feels good about themselves, regardless of their actions.",

            "question": "A client expresses deep anxiety, stating, 'I feel like I'm losing control, and God isn't doing anything.' Applying principles from L1 (God's Sufficiency) and L2 (The Human Heart), the coach's initial biblical response should acknowledge that:",
            "options": [
                "God is sovereign and sufficient, even amidst perceived lack of control, and anxiety often stems from a heart seeking control outside of Him or distrusting His plan.",
                "Their feelings are valid, and they should just try to relax and pray more, without further exploration.",
                "This is primarily a sign of a chemical imbalance requiring immediate medical intervention.",
                "They need to simply try harder to trust God, focusing on outward actions rather than inner belief."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Integrating L1 and L2, a biblical coach would recognize that anxiety often points to a heart struggle with control or trust in God's sovereignty. The response should affirm God's sufficiency while gently guiding the client to examine their heart's posture towards God's control, rather than offering simplistic solutions or externalizing the problem."

            "question": "During the 'Welcome & Witness' (W) and Initial Assessment (L5) phases, a coach notices the client frequently interrupts, avoids eye contact, and gives short, defensive answers. What is the most appropriate immediate action for the coach?",

                "Directly confront the client about their defensiveness to break through their resistance.",
                "Immediately pivot to sharing their personal testimony to try and inspire openness.",
                "Practice active, empathetic listening, and gently ask open-ended questions to invite more complete sharing, while observing non-verbal cues.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario calls for patience and discernment, as taught in L4 and L5. The coach should continue to foster a welcoming environment through empathetic listening and gentle, open-ended questions, observing these behaviors as data points, rather than confronting, prematurely sharing, or disengaging. This approach aims to build trust and gather more information."
