            "question": "What is the primary purpose of an ethical code for Certified Biblical Counseling Coaches?",
            "options": [
                "To dictate specific theological doctrines clients must adhere to.",
                "To provide a framework for professional conduct, client protection, and accountability.",
                "To ensure coaches always achieve desired client outcomes.",
                "To replace legal regulations in all coaching situations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical codes serve as guidelines for professional behavior, safeguarding clients' well-being and establishing a standard of accountability for coaches. They do not dictate theological doctrines, guarantee outcomes, or supersede legal regulations."

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "A biblical coach uses a popular, unencrypted messaging app to communicate with clients about sensitive issues. Which ethical and legal principle is most directly violated by this practice?",
            "options": [
                "Scope of Practice",
                "Professional Boundaries",
                "Data Protection and Confidentiality",
                "Financial Compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using unencrypted communication methods for sensitive client information directly compromises data protection and confidentiality. It exposes client data to potential unauthorized access, violating privacy principles outlined in L2."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "During a coaching session, a client reveals they suspect their elderly neighbor is being physically abused by their caregiver. As a Certified Biblical Counseling Coach, what is your primary ethical and legal obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the client to confront the caregiver directly.",
                "Maintain absolute confidentiality as the information was shared in a coaching context.",
                "Assess the situation for signs of elder abuse and consider mandated reporting requirements.",
                "Suggest the client pray about the situation and wait for divine intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In many jurisdictions, elder abuse is subject to mandated reporting, similar to child abuse. The coach's primary obligation is to assess the situation for credible signs of abuse and, if warranted, fulfill their legal duty to report, balancing this with confidentiality. This falls under the 'Mandated Reporting' principles discussed in L3."

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "A client approaches a Certified Biblical Counseling Coach seeking a formal diagnosis for their long-standing depression and advice on specific psychiatric medications. How should the coach respond ethically and within their scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Provide a biblical perspective on depression and suggest specific herbal remedies.",
                "Explain that diagnosing mental health conditions and recommending medication are outside the scope of biblical coaching, and provide a referral to a licensed mental health professional.",
                "Offer to research psychiatric medications and suggest the client discuss them with their primary care physician.",
                "Assure the client that biblical principles alone can cure their depression, making professional diagnosis unnecessary."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biblical coaching operates outside the realm of medical diagnosis and treatment. Providing a diagnosis or recommending medication would constitute practicing medicine or mental health therapy without a license, violating the coach's scope of practice (L4). The ethical response is to refer the client to an appropriately licensed professional."

            "id": "q33_5",
            "question": "A client, deeply grateful for the coaching they received, offers their coach a significant monetary gift (e.g., $500) at the conclusion of their sessions. What is the most appropriate ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Graciously accept the gift as a token of appreciation.",
                "Accept the gift but immediately donate it to a charity.",
                "Decline the gift, explaining the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and avoiding potential conflicts of interest, while affirming the client's gratitude.",
                "Accept the gift but offer to provide additional free coaching sessions in return."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Accepting significant gifts from clients can create dual relationships, blur professional boundaries, and introduce potential conflicts of interest (L5). The most ethical response is to respectfully decline, reinforce the professional nature of the relationship, and acknowledge the client's appreciation verbally."

            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "According to best practices for record-keeping in biblical coaching, what is the recommended minimum duration for retaining client records after the termination of services?",

                "1 year",
                "3 years",
                "5-7 years",
                "Indefinitely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While specific legal requirements can vary by jurisdiction, a common professional best practice, often recommended by professional organizations, is to retain client records for 5-7 years after the last date of service. This allows for potential legal or ethical inquiries and aligns with general professional standards (L6)."

            "question": "When marketing biblical coaching services, which of the following practices is considered unethical and potentially misleading?",
            "options": [
                "Clearly stating qualifications and areas of expertise.",
                "Using testimonials from satisfied clients with their explicit permission.",
                "Guaranteeing specific life-altering results or cures for psychological conditions.",
                "Providing transparent pricing and service descriptions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing (L7) requires honesty and transparency. Guaranteeing specific outcomes or 'cures' for complex human conditions is misleading, unrealistic, and can set false expectations, which is considered unethical in professional practice."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "A Certified Biblical Counseling Coach is considering offering tele-coaching services to clients in different states. What is the primary legal and ethical concern they must address before engaging in cross-jurisdictional practice?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring their internet connection is stable enough.",
                "Verifying any state-specific licensing or registration requirements for coaching or related professions in the client's jurisdiction.",
                "Confirming the client has a quiet space for sessions.",
                "Limiting tele-coaching to only clients they have previously met in person."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most significant legal and ethical concern for cross-jurisdictional tele-coaching (L8) is understanding and complying with the laws and regulations of the client's location. Licensing, registration, and scope of practice can vary significantly between states or countries, and coaches must ensure they are legally permitted to practice in that jurisdiction."

        {
            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a crucial component that must be explicitly included in an informed consent agreement for biblical coaching services to ensure client autonomy and data protection?",
            "options": [
                "A guarantee of specific outcomes from coaching.",
                "A clause stating that the coach is not responsible for any client decisions.",
                "Details regarding the limits of confidentiality, data storage practices, and how client information will be protected and potentially shared.",
                "A requirement for the client to attend a minimum number of sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent (L2, L6) is fundamental to ethical practice. It must clearly outline the parameters of confidentiality, how client data is stored and protected, and any circumstances under which information might be shared (e.g., mandated reporting). This empowers clients to make informed decisions about engaging in services."

        {
            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "A client expresses vague suicidal ideation, stating, 'Sometimes I just wish I wasn't here anymore.' As a biblical coach, you do not assess immediate intent or plan. What is the most appropriate initial ethical step, considering both duty to warn and scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately contact emergency services without further assessment.",
                "Advise the client to pray more and focus on biblical hope.",
                "Engage in a thorough risk assessment to determine the immediacy and severity of the threat, while also considering referral to a licensed mental health professional for crisis intervention.",
                "Document the statement and continue coaching as usual, assuming it's a passing thought."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vague suicidal ideation requires careful attention. The coach's duty is to assess the level of risk, which includes exploring intent, plan, and means. While a biblical coach should not provide therapy, they have an ethical responsibility to ensure client safety. This often means conducting a basic risk assessment and, if any risk is identified, making an immediate referral to a licensed mental health professional or crisis services, as appropriate, while staying within the boundaries of coaching (L3, L4)."
