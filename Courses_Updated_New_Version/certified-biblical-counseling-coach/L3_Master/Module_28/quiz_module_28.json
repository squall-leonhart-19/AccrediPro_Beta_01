            "question": "A client, Sarah, reveals during a session that she has been struggling with intense suicidal ideation for several weeks, has a detailed plan, and access to the means. She asks for prayer but states she feels hopeless. What is the biblical counselor's <em>immediate and primary</em> ethical and practical responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Engage in extensive prayer and scripture reading to instill hope.",
                "Immediately assess for imminent danger, develop a safety plan, and initiate appropriate professional referral protocols.",
                "Focus on identifying the root spiritual issues contributing to her hopelessness.",
                "Reassure her that God has a plan for her life and she should trust Him."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In situations of imminent danger, especially with specific plans and means for suicide, the immediate priority is always safety assessment, safety planning, and professional referral. While spiritual support is vital, it must follow ensuring the client's immediate physical safety, as detailed in L2 and L3."

            "question": "When a biblical counselor identifies signs of ongoing physical abuse in a minor client, what is the <em>first and non-negotiable</em> action required by most ethical and legal standards?",
            "options": [
                "Counsel the parents on biblical principles of child-rearing and discipline.",
                "Report the suspected abuse to child protective services or law enforcement.",
                "Encourage the child to pray for their parents and forgive them.",
                "Develop a long-term counseling plan focused on the child's emotional healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L5, biblical counselors are often mandated reporters. When there is suspicion of ongoing abuse, especially of a minor, the immediate and non-negotiable action is to report it to the appropriate authorities (e.g., child protective services or law enforcement) to ensure the victim's safety."

            "question": "A client, Mark, exhibits persistent symptoms including grandiose delusions, severe racing thoughts, and periods of profound depression alternating with intense euphoria, significantly impairing his daily functioning. As a biblical counseling coach, what is the most appropriate course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Focus exclusively on spiritual disciplines and scripture memorization to stabilize his mood.",
                "Diagnose him with Bipolar Disorder and begin a targeted biblical counseling plan.",
                "Recognize these symptoms suggest a complex mental health disorder beyond the scope of biblical counseling alone and facilitate an immediate referral to a psychiatrist or mental health professional.",
                "Encourage him to 'think biblically' about his thoughts and feelings to overcome his symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described (delusions, racing thoughts, severe mood swings) are indicative of a severe mental health disorder (potentially Bipolar Disorder or a psychotic disorder) that requires professional medical and psychiatric assessment and treatment. L8 emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limits of biblical counseling and facilitating appropriate referrals for complex mental health conditions."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "In working with a survivor of significant trauma, a key principle of trauma-informed care is to avoid re-traumatization. Which of the following best exemplifies this principle in a biblical counseling context?",
            "options": [
                "Insisting the client immediately recount all details of the traumatic event for processing.",
                "Prioritizing the establishment of safety, predictability, and client empowerment before delving into traumatic memories.",
                "Attributing the trauma solely to spiritual warfare and focusing only on exorcism or deliverance.",
                "Downplaying the severity of the trauma to encourage a 'move on' mentality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As highlighted in L4, trauma-informed care prioritizes creating a safe and predictable environment, empowering the client, and ensuring emotional and physical safety before any deep processing of traumatic memories. Rushing into details without this foundation can easily re-traumatize the individual."

            "question": "A widow, Eleanor, lost her husband 18 months ago. She continues to experience intense yearning, pervasive emotional pain, difficulty accepting the death, and significant functional impairment, meeting criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder. What biblical counseling approach is most helpful in addressing this complex grief?",
            "options": [
                "Minimizing her pain by emphasizing the husband is 'in a better place.'",
                "Encouraging her to suppress her emotions and focus solely on joyful memories.",
                "Validating her profound loss, facilitating lament, exploring the meaning of suffering biblically, and gently guiding her towards finding a renewed sense of purpose and connection, potentially alongside professional support.",
                "Suggesting her grief is a lack of faith and encouraging more fervent prayer for healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L6 discusses complex grief. A helpful biblical approach involves validating the depth of the loss, allowing for lament (as seen in Psalms), and helping the individual process their grief through a biblical lens, seeking meaning, and slowly re-engaging with life, acknowledging that professional mental health support might also be beneficial for Prolonged Grief Disorder."

            "question": "A client, David, is struggling with a long-standing opioid addiction. While he expresses a desire for change, he frequently relapses. From an advanced biblical counseling perspective, what is a critical strategy to implement?",
            "options": [
                "Simply tell him to 'just stop' and pray harder.",
                "Implement a comprehensive strategy including identifying triggers, developing coping mechanisms, establishing robust accountability, addressing underlying heart issues, and integrating spiritual disciplines for sustained transformation.",
                "Focus solely on a one-time 'deliverance' prayer to break the addiction immediately.",
                "Provide a list of scriptures to memorize without further practical application."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L7 emphasizes that advanced strategies for addiction require a comprehensive approach. This includes understanding the cycle of addiction, addressing underlying heart issues, implementing practical behavioral changes, establishing strong accountability, and integrating spiritual disciplines for long-term transformation, rather than simplistic solutions."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "Which statement best encapsulates the biblical counselor's foundational perspective on suffering in crisis intervention, distinguishing it from purely secular approaches?",
            "options": [
                "Suffering is always a direct consequence of personal sin and must be repented of.",
                "Suffering is an unavoidable part of the fallen world, and while painful, can be redeemed by God for His glory and the believer's sanctification, offering hope beyond circumstances.",
                "Suffering is primarily a psychological phenomenon requiring clinical diagnosis and medication.",
                "Suffering should be avoided at all costs, and the counselor's main goal is immediate pain cessation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L1 highlights the biblical perspective on suffering. While sin can be a factor, suffering is also a reality of a fallen world, and God can use it for redemptive purposes, offering a unique hope that transcends immediate circumstances, unlike purely secular approaches that may focus solely on symptom reduction or avoidance."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "When conducting a safety assessment with a client exhibiting suicide ideation, which question is most direct and effective for determining immediate risk?",
            "options": [
                "'Are you feeling sad today?'",
                "'Do you ever think about suicide?'",
                "'Do you have a plan to end your life, and do you have access to the means?'",
                "'What is making you feel this way?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As taught in L3, a direct assessment of suicidal intent, plan, and access to means is critical for determining immediate risk. While other questions may be useful for building rapport or understanding context, this specific question directly addresses the most urgent safety concerns."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client reports that their church leader demands absolute loyalty to him personally, discourages questioning his authority, isolates members from outside relationships, and uses scripture to justify punitive actions for perceived disobedience. This pattern is indicative of what form of abuse?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional neglect.",
                "Financial exploitation.",
                "Spiritual abuse.",
                "Physical intimidation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L5 details spiritual abuse as the misuse of spiritual authority, often involving control, manipulation, isolation, and misinterpretation of scripture to maintain power over others. The described behaviors align directly with characteristics of spiritual abuse."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "When a biblical counseling coach refers a client to a licensed mental health professional for a diagnosed clinical disorder, what is the <em>most effective</em> way for the biblical counselor to continue supporting the client, if appropriate and agreed upon?",
            "options": [
                "Cease all counseling immediately, as the client is now under professional care.",
                "Continue counseling independently, focusing only on spiritual matters, without communication with the mental health professional.",
                "Offer collaborative care, focusing on spiritual integration, discipleship, and practical support, while respecting the mental health professional's scope and maintaining appropriate communication channels with client consent.",
                "Encourage the client to choose between biblical counseling and professional therapy, as they are mutually exclusive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L8 emphasizes the value of collaborative care. When a client is receiving professional mental health treatment, a biblical counselor can provide invaluable spiritual integration, discipleship, and practical support, working in conjunction with the mental health professional (with client consent) to offer holistic care, rather than viewing the two approaches as mutually exclusive or operating in isolation."
