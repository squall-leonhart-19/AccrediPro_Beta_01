            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Supervision is primarily about ensuring competent client care and developing specific counseling skills, often with a formal, evaluative component. Mentoring, while including skill development, takes a broader view, focusing on the mentee's overall spiritual maturity, character, and long-term professional identity, often in a less formal, more relational context."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical guidelines mandate breaking confidentiality when there is a clear and imminent danger to self or others.
