            "question": "A client presents with chronic anxiety, attributing it to external pressures and past hurts. During the advanced diagnostic phase (L1), a Master Biblical Coach aims to identify the root spiritual issue. Which approach is most aligned with advanced diagnostic techniques?",
            "options": [
                "Focus solely on cognitive-behavioral techniques to manage anxiety symptoms.",
                "Recommend immediate professional psychiatric evaluation without further biblical assessment.",
                "Utilize a comprehensive spiritual history intake, genogram analysis, and prayerful discernment to uncover underlying idolatries or unconfessed sin patterns contributing to the anxiety.",
                "Provide a list of Bible verses on peace and instruct the client to read them daily."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced diagnostic techniques in biblical counseling (L1) go beyond surface symptoms to prayerfully and systematically uncover root spiritual issues like idolatry, unconfessed sin, or false beliefs, often utilizing tools like spiritual history intakes and genograms to understand contextual patterns."

            "question": "During a session, a Master Biblical Coach observes a client consistently making excuses for a pattern of gossip, minimizing its impact. Applying principles from 'Mastering the Art of Biblical Confrontation & Gentle Correction' (L2), what is the most appropriate initial step for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately quote Proverbs 11:13 and sternly rebuke the client.",
                "Ignore the behavior to maintain rapport and address it later if it escalates.",
                "Using a 'sandwich' approach, affirm the client's strengths, gently highlight the destructive nature of gossip from a biblical perspective (e.g., James 3:6), and offer a path to repentance and change.",
                "Suggest the client seek a secular therapist for communication issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L2 emphasizes gentle correction and confrontation aimed at restoration, not condemnation. The 'sandwich' approach (affirmation-correction-encouragement) or similar methods, coupled with clear biblical truth, is effective for addressing sin patterns while maintaining a redemptive focus."

            "question": "A client discloses experiencing severe panic attacks and flashbacks related to a past traumatic event, indicating symptoms of complex trauma (L3). The Master Biblical Coach's immediate priority should be:",
            "options": [
                "To immediately lead the client through a detailed recounting of the traumatic event for processing.",
                "To establish immediate safety and stabilization, provide spiritual grounding through Scripture and prayer, and assess for any immediate risk of harm, while considering appropriate referrals for co-occurring mental health needs.",
                "To solely focus on forgiveness of the perpetrator as the first and only step to healing.",
                "To dismiss the flashbacks as 'worldly' and encourage the client to simply 'pray it away'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When navigating complex trauma (L3), the immediate priority is always safety and stabilization. This involves creating a secure environment, providing spiritual grounding, assessing for risk, and understanding the necessity of multi-faceted care, including potential referrals for severe mental health symptoms, while integrating biblical truths for healing."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently prioritizes her career advancement and financial success above all else, often neglecting her family and spiritual disciplines. When faced with setbacks, she experiences intense despair. From the perspective of 'Addressing Deep-Seated Idolatry & Worldview Conflicts' (L4), what is Sarah's primary challenge?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of motivation and poor time management.",
                "A deep-seated idolatry of control and worldly achievement, leading to a worldview where self-worth is tied to external success.",
                "Insufficient self-help strategies for stress management.",
                "A simple need for better organizational skills."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson L4 defines idolatry as anything that replaces God as the ultimate source of value, identity, and security. Sarah's pattern suggests her career and financial success have become idols, leading to despair when these idols fail, revealing a worldview conflict where her worth is tied to earthly achievements rather than her identity in Christ."

                "Provide more theoretical knowledge about biblical doctrines.",
                "Design a personalized spiritual growth plan emphasizing consistent engagement with spiritual disciplines like daily Scripture meditation, prayer, fasting, and active participation in Christian community.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson L5 highlights that lasting transformation involves more than intellectual assent; it requires active engagement with spiritual disciplines that renew the mind and heart.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A genogram (L6) is a powerful tool for mapping family history and dynamics. It helps identify recurring patterns, unresolved issues, and relational styles across generations, providing insight into how these dynamics may be influencing the client's current struggles from a biblical perspective."

            "question": "A Master Biblical Coach is approached by a long-term client seeking a personal loan for a business venture. The coach recognizes this as an ethical dilemma (L7). What is the most appropriate action based on professional boundaries?",
            "options": [
                "Offer the loan, as it demonstrates care and trust in the client relationship.",
                "Decline the request, explaining that engaging in dual relationships (counselor and lender) compromises professional boundaries, potentially harming the counseling relationship and client welfare.",
                "Suggest the client find another coach who might be willing to help financially.",
                "Provide the loan but require the client to sign a waiver absolving the coach of any conflict of interest."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson L7 strongly emphasizes maintaining professional boundaries and avoiding dual relationships. Lending money to a client creates a significant conflict of interest, shifts the dynamic, and can severely compromise the objectivity and effectiveness of the counseling relationship, even with good intentions."

            "question": "According to 'Cultivating a Culture of Discipleship & Mentorship' (L8), what is a key distinction between biblical counseling and biblical discipleship?",
            "options": [
                "Counseling is only for crises, while discipleship is for everyday life.",
                "Counseling primarily focuses on resolving specific problems and sin patterns, often in a more structured, time-limited format, whereas discipleship is a broader, ongoing process of growing in Christ-likeness and equipping for ministry.",
                "Discipleship is exclusively for new believers, and counseling is for mature Christians.",
                "Biblical counseling requires formal training, while discipleship does not."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson L8 clarifies that while both involve spiritual growth, biblical counseling often addresses specific, presenting problems or sin patterns with targeted interventions. Discipleship, however, encompasses the lifelong journey of conforming to Christ's image, spiritual formation, and equipping believers for service, often in less formal, ongoing relationships."

            "question": "A client is struggling with persistent feelings of inadequacy and self-condemnation, despite intellectual knowledge of God's grace. Advanced diagnostics (L1) reveal a history of harsh criticism from parents and a tendency to base self-worth on performance (L4). Which intervention strategy best addresses this complex interplay?",
            "options": [
                "Simply reiterate Bible verses about God's love without exploring the underlying beliefs.",
                "Focus on identifying the deep-seated idol of performance and approval, helping the client dismantle false beliefs about self-worth, and re-anchor their identity in Christ's finished work and unconditional love, while also addressing any lingering unforgiveness towards parents.",
                "Recommend ignoring the past and focusing only on future behaviors.",
                "Suggest the client needs more self-esteem exercises from secular psychology."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This question combines L1 (advanced diagnostics) and L4 (idolatry/worldview). The most effective strategy is to diagnose the underlying idol of performance and approval, directly challenge the false beliefs about self-worth, and biblically reorient the client's identity to Christ, while also addressing relational wounds that feed these patterns."

            "question": "After several intense sessions dealing with a client's severe marital conflict and childhood abuse, a Master Biblical Coach feels emotionally exhausted and irritable, struggling to focus on personal devotional time. According to 'Ethical Dilemmas, Self-Care, & Professional Boundaries' (L7), what is the most critical action for the coach?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson L7 stresses the critical importance of self-care for Master Biblical Coaches, especially when dealing with complex and draining client situations. Intentional practices like supervision, peer support, spiritual disciplines, and healthy boundaries are essential to prevent burnout, manage vicarious trauma, and maintain professional effectiveness and personal well-being."
