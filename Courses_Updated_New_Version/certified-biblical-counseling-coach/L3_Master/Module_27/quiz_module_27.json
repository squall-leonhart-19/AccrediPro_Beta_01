            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of complex trauma, including hypervigilance and distrust. According to Lesson L1, what is the *most crucial* initial step for a biblical counselor in establishing a therapeutic alliance?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately address forgiveness for perpetrators.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
