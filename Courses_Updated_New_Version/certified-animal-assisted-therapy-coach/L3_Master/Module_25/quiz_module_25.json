            "question": "Which of the following is considered a primary, unique ethical imperative in Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) supervision, distinguishing it from traditional clinical supervision?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring client confidentiality.",
                "Promoting the supervisee's professional development.",
                "Prioritizing the welfare and safety of the animal partner.",
                "Adhering to professional billing practices."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all options represent important aspects of supervision, the ethical imperative to prioritize the welfare and safety of the animal partner is unique and paramount in AAT supervision, as animals are co-facilitators and not merely tools. This is a foundational principle covered in L1."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "When establishing a supervisory contract in AAT, which element is uniquely critical for the AAT context compared to general counseling supervision?",
            "options": [
                "Agreement on supervision frequency and duration.",
                "Clarification of confidentiality limits.",

                "Outline of fee structure and payment terms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While general supervision contracts cover frequency, confidentiality, and fees, the AAT context specifically requires clear protocols for the animal's well-being, including health emergencies and behavioral shifts, which directly impact the therapeutic process and are essential for animal welfare. This is a key component of the supervisory contract discussed in L2."

        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "A supervisee consistently finds their clients exhibiting resistance and difficulty forming bonds during AAT sessions. In supervision, the supervisee themselves frequently expresses frustration with the supervisory process and struggles to connect with their supervisor. This dynamic is best understood through which supervisory concept?",
            "options": [
                "Transference",
                "Countertransference",

                "Projection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel process describes the phenomenon where dynamics in the client-therapist relationship are unconsciously replicated in the supervisee-supervisor relationship, offering a valuable opportunity for insight and intervention. This core concept from L3 helps supervisors understand and address underlying issues."

            "question": "An AAT supervisee informs their supervisor that they have started a side business selling animal training products to some of their AAT clients, believing it complements their therapy work. What is the primary ethical concern the supervisor should address?",

                "Competence in animal training.",
                "Potential for a dual relationship and conflict of interest.",
                "Confidentiality of client purchasing habits.",
                "Compliance with local business licensing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary ethical concern is the creation of a dual relationship and potential conflict of interest, which can exploit clients, impair professional judgment, and undermine the therapeutic relationship. This is a common ethical dilemma highlighted in L4."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mentoring typically focuses on a broader, long-term perspective of career development, professional identity, and leadership, extending beyond the immediate clinical oversight characteristic of supervision. This distinction is elaborated in L5."

            "id": "q25_6",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all listed are important for a competent AAT professional, 'Animal-Assisted Intervention Protocol Implementation and Animal Welfare Stewardship' directly addresses the unique competency of integrating the animal partner effectively, ethically, and with due regard for their welfare. This is a critical evaluation domain from L6."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While group supervision offers many benefits, a key challenge is ensuring that each individual supervisee receives adequate personalized attention and direct consultation for their specific cases, which can be diluted in a group setting. This aspect of group dynamics is covered in L7."

            "question": "During an AAT supervision session, the supervisor asks the supervisee to describe a recent challenging interaction with a client and their therapy dog, then encourages the supervisee to consider alternative animal cues or client engagement strategies.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The supervisor is prompting the supervisee to critically analyze their experience and self-reflect on their actions and potential alternatives, guided by the supervisor's questions, which is characteristic of reflective practice and Socratic questioning. This is a core supervisory technique from L3."

            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "A supervisor notes that their AAT supervisee, who works with trauma survivors, has become increasingly withdrawn, cynical, and reports difficulty bonding with their own therapy animal. The supervisor suspects compassion fatigue. Which immediate action is most ethically responsible for the supervisor?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The supervisor has an ethical responsibility to address the supervisee's well-being, especially when signs of compassion fatigue or burnout are present, as it impacts both the supervisee's effectiveness and client safety. Initiating a supportive discussion about self-care and suggesting resources is an appropriate and ethical first step in addressing professional challenges, as covered in L4."
