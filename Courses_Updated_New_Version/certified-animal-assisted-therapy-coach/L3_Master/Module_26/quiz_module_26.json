                "Keep it broad to allow for flexibility in intervention design.",
                "Translate it into a <span class=\"highlight\">SMART goal</span>, such as 'Client will initiate positive interaction with the therapy animal 3 times per 30-minute session for 4 consecutive weeks.'",
                "Assume the animal's presence will naturally lead to happiness without specific targets.",
                "Focus only on physiological markers of happiness, like heart rate variability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For an evidence-based program, vague goals like 'feel happier' must be transformed into SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals. Option B provides a clear, measurable behavioral target that can be tracked and evaluated within a defined timeframe, aligning with both advanced assessment and intervention design principles."

            "question": "A therapy dog, 'Buddy,' has been working for 3 hours straight with multiple clients. Buddy begins to frequently lick his lips and shift his weight, even when not directly interacting. From a risk management and animal welfare perspective (L4 & L5), what is the most appropriate immediate action?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage Buddy to continue, as he is a well-trained animal.",
                "Immediately remove Buddy from the session and provide a rest break, observing for further stress signs.",
                "Offer Buddy a treat to distract him from his subtle discomfort.",
                "Assume these are normal behaviors and continue the session as planned."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lip licking and shifting weight can be subtle but significant signs of stress or fatigue in dogs. Recognizing these cues is crucial for animal welfare and risk management. The most appropriate action is to immediately remove the animal from the working environment to provide a rest break, preventing further stress and potential escalation of undesirable behaviors."
