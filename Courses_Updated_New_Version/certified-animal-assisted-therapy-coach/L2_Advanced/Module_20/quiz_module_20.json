            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "During an AAT session, a therapy cat suddenly flattens its ears, tucks its tail, and attempts to hide under a chair. These behaviors are clear indicators that the AAT coach should immediately:",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to coax the cat out with treats.",
                "Interpret these as signs of playfulness and ignore them.",
                "Recognize potential stress signals and provide the animal with a break or remove it from the situation.",
                "Document the cat's \"misbehavior\" for future training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flattened ears, tucked tail, and hiding are classic signs of stress or fear in cats. An ethical AAT coach must prioritize animal welfare by recognizing these signals and immediately intervening to remove the animal from the stressful situation, offering a break, or ending the session to prevent further distress."
