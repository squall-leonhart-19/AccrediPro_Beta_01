            "question": "Which of the following is the most critical first step in establishing an ethical Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) treatment plan, as emphasized in L1?",
            "options": [
                "Obtaining comprehensive informed consent from the client or their legal guardian.",
                "Selecting the most experienced animal partner available for the session.",
                "Developing a detailed session plan with specific activities.",

            "question": "According to the 'B' in BOND model (Blueprinting Goals) discussed in L2, when setting therapeutic goals for a client with social anxiety, which goal best exemplifies the SMART criteria?",
            "options": [
                "Client will feel less anxious around others.",
                "Client will interact with the therapy animal more frequently.",
                "Client will initiate verbal interaction with the AAT coach or animal handler at least twice per session for 3 consecutive sessions, observed over a 4-week period.",
                "Client will develop better coping mechanisms for anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal 'Client will initiate verbal interaction with the AAT coach or animal handler at least twice per session for 3 consecutive sessions, observed over a 4-week period' is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART), aligning with the principles of Blueprinting Goals from Lesson 2."

            "question": "A client, 8-year-old Leo, presents with significant motor skill delays and low motivation for traditional occupational therapy. Based on L3's guidance for selecting AAI, which animal partner characteristic would be most appropriate for engaging Leo in fine motor tasks?",
            "options": [
                "A large, energetic Golden Retriever trained for agility.",
                "A calm, patient cat that enjoys gentle petting and grooming.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A calm, patient cat that enjoys gentle petting and grooming would be ideal. Grooming activities require fine motor skills, and the cat's calm demeanor provides a non-threatening, engaging stimulus. The Golden Retriever might be too stimulating, the parrot might be distracting, and the guinea pig might not offer enough interactive opportunity for motor tasks."

            "question": "During the 'Structuring AAT Sessions' phase (L4), a coach is designing a session for a client working on emotional regulation. Which documentation standard is most effective for capturing the client's progress, the animal's contribution, and the coach's interventions?",
            "options": [
                "A simple checklist of activities completed.",
                "SOAP notes, detailing Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 emphasizes the importance of thorough documentation. SOAP notes (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) provide a structured, comprehensive framework for capturing all critical aspects of an AAT session, including client reports, observable behaviors, coach's clinical interpretation, and future steps."

            "question": "In the 'Observing Dynamics' stage (O in BOND, L5), a client suddenly becomes withdrawn and the therapy dog begins to yawn repeatedly and lick its lips. What is the most appropriate immediate action for the AAT coach?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to continue the activity to push through discomfort.",
                "Ignore the animal's cues, focusing solely on the client's behavior.",
                "Pause the activity, assess both client and animal for signs of stress, and adapt the session.",
                "Immediately terminate the session without further assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 stresses the importance of observing both client and animal dynamics. Yawning and lip licking in dogs are common signs of stress. The coach must pause, assess both parties' well-being, and adapt the session to ensure safety and therapeutic effectiveness, rather than pushing or prematurely terminating."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A client is working on assertiveness, and the AAT coach has facilitated an activity where the client needs to calmly instruct the therapy dog to perform a trick. According to L6, what is the coach's primary role during the 'Nurturing Growth' (N in BOND) phase immediately after the interaction?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately move on to the next activity.",
                "To praise the dog for its performance.",
                "To process the client's experience, encouraging reflection on their communication, feelings, and the dog's response.",
                "To correct any mistakes the client made during the instruction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6, focusing on 'Nurturing Growth,' emphasizes that the coach's primary role after an intervention is to facilitate processing. This involves encouraging the client to reflect on their experience, communication, emotions, and the animal's reactions to deepen insight and reinforce learning, rather than just moving on or correcting."

            "options": [
                "The client's subjective feeling of being 'a little better'.",
                "The AAT coach's general impression of improvement.",
                "Pre- and post-session scores on a standardized anxiety rating scale (e.g., GAD-7) and observed changes in physiological markers (e.g., heart rate variability).",
                "The number of times the client smiled during a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 highlights that objective and quantifiable data are crucial for effective progress monitoring. Using standardized rating scales like GAD-7 and observing physiological markers provides empirical evidence of change, moving beyond subjective impressions or anecdotal observations."

            "question": "When approaching the 'Termination, Transition, and Sustaining Outcomes' phase (L8) with a client who has formed a strong bond with the therapy animal, what is the most ethical and supportive action for the AAT coach?",
            "options": [
                "Abruptly end sessions once goals are met to prevent over-reliance.",
                "Encourage the client to find a new pet immediately to fill the void.",
                "Initiate a gradual termination process, discuss feelings about ending the bond, reinforce learned skills, and plan for sustaining gains without the therapy animal.",
                "Avoid discussing termination until the very last session to prevent distress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 stresses the importance of an ethical and supportive termination process. This involves gradual phasing out, openly discussing the emotional aspects of ending the bond, reinforcing strategies for maintaining progress, and planning for continued support to ensure sustainable outcomes."

            "question": "A new AAT coach is working with a client who has a history of trauma and is very hesitant to engage with the therapy animal. Which sequence of actions demonstrates best practice, integrating principles from L1, L2, and L5?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately introduce a highly playful dog to encourage interaction, then assess the client's reaction.",
                "Prioritize building rapport without the animal present, conduct thorough assessment (L2), ensure informed consent (L1) including potential triggers, and introduce the animal gradually while closely observing both client and animal dynamics (L5).",
                "Allow the client to choose any animal they prefer, regardless of the animal's training or temperament.",
                "Focus solely on the client's verbal communication, ignoring non-verbal cues related to the animal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This option integrates multiple key lessons: L1 (informed consent, ethical considerations for vulnerable populations), L2 (thorough assessment and goal setting before intervention), and L5 (observing dynamics and gradual introduction). It prioritizes safety, client readiness, and therapeutic appropriateness over immediate engagement."

            "question": "During an AAT session focused on improving a client's emotional expression, the therapy animal suddenly shows signs of fatigue and disinterest. Based on L5 and L6, what is the most appropriate response from the AAT coach?",
            "options": [
                "Gently encourage the client to keep interacting with the animal to achieve the session's goal.",
                "Immediately remove the animal from the session and continue with talk therapy.",
                "Acknowledge the animal's cues, take a break or adjust the activity to allow the animal to rest, and use this as an opportunity to process with the client about respecting boundaries and empathy for others' needs.",
                "Switch to a different animal partner immediately if one is available."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lessons 5 and 6 emphasize animal welfare and processing. Recognizing animal fatigue requires immediate action to ensure the animal's well-being. This situation also presents a valuable therapeutic opportunity to process with the client about empathy, respecting boundaries, and non-verbal communication, reinforcing the 'Nurturing Growth' aspect."
