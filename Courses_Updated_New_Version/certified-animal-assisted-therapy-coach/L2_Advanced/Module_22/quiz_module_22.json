            "question": "During an AAT session, a client makes a casual remark indicating they are neglecting their own pet at home, which raises concerns about animal welfare. According to L1: Core Ethical Principles, which principle presents the most immediate ethical tension with client confidentiality in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "Non-maleficence (to the animal)",
                "Autonomy (of the client)",
                "Fidelity (to the therapeutic relationship)",
                "Justice (fairness in treatment)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The principle of non-maleficence, particularly regarding the welfare of another animal, often creates a tension with client confidentiality. While maintaining confidentiality is crucial, the ethical duty to prevent harm (non-maleficence) may necessitate breaking confidentiality if an animal's well-being is at serious risk, requiring consultation with supervisors and relevant authorities."

            "question": "A 10-year-old child, 'Leo,' is referred for AAT. His parents have provided full informed consent. According to L2: Informed Consent, what additional step is ethically required to ensure Leo's participation respects his autonomy?",
            "options": [
                "Obtain a court order for his participation.",
                "Ensure Leo provides verbal assent and understands the intervention to his capacity.",
                "Administer a psychological assessment to determine his capacity for consent.",
                "Proceed with sessions as parental consent is sufficient for minors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For minors, even with parental consent, obtaining the child's assent is an ethical imperative. Assent means the child understands the nature of the intervention, its benefits and risks, and agrees to participate to the best of their developmental capacity, with the understanding they can withdraw at any time."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "You observe your therapy dog, 'Buddy,' displaying repeated lip-licking, yawning, and head turns during a session, despite appearing calm moments before. According to L3: Safeguarding Therapy Animal Welfare, what is the most appropriate and immediate ethical action?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the session, as these are minor signs of adjustment.",
                "Gently correct Buddy to encourage focus on the client.",

                "Increase the duration of the session to help Buddy habituate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lip-licking, yawning, and head turns are common subtle signs of stress or discomfort in dogs. Ethically, the therapy animal's well-being must be prioritized. The handler should immediately remove the animal from the situation, assess its condition, and determine if it's fit to continue or needs a break/retirement, as per L3 guidelines."

            "question": "An AAT client, 'Maria,' who is also a professional baker, offers to bake a cake for your therapy animal as a gesture of gratitude. According to L4: Professional Boundaries, what is the most ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the cake as a harmless token of appreciation.",
                "Politely decline, explaining the importance of maintaining professional boundaries regarding gifts.",
                "Accept the cake but offer to pay for it to avoid a dual relationship.",
                "Accept the cake only if it's consumed outside of therapy sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Accepting gifts, especially those with significant value or that could create an ongoing obligation, can blur professional boundaries and lead to dual relationships. The most ethical response is to politely decline, explaining the importance of maintaining professional boundaries to ensure the integrity of the therapeutic relationship, as outlined in L4."

            "question": "An AAT coach uses a cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) system to store client notes. According to L5: Confidentiality, Privacy, and Data Management, what is a critical requirement for this system to be ethically compliant?",
            "options": [
                "It must be accessible by all members of the AAT team for collaboration.",
                "It must comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) and use strong encryption.",
                "It should store only anonymized data, with no client identifiers.",
                "It must be hosted on a server physically located within the same country as the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical data management requires strict adherence to privacy regulations like HIPAA (USA) or GDPR (EU).

            "question": "Before initiating AAT with a new client known to have severe seasonal allergies, what is the primary safety protocol an AAT coach should implement, as per L6: Risk Assessment?",

                "Administer an antihistamine to the client prior to the session.",
                "Ensure the therapy animal is bathed immediately before each session.",
                "Conduct a thorough pre-screening for allergies and have an emergency protocol in place, potentially using hypoallergenic breeds or alternative interventions.",
                "Limit the duration of the AAT session to minimize exposure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive risk assessment (L6) for allergies includes pre-screening to identify sensitivities, discussing potential reactions, and having a clear emergency plan. This might involve selecting a hypoallergenic therapy animal, conducting sessions outdoors, or opting for alternative interventions if the risk cannot be adequately mitigated. Administering medication or simply bathing the animal may not be sufficient or within the coach's scope."

            "question": "An AAT coach faces a dilemma where a client's significant progress in therapy is heavily reliant on their bond with a specific therapy animal, 'Daisy,' who is now showing signs of age-related decline and needs to retire. According to L7: Ethical Decision-Making Models, what is the most crucial first step in addressing this complex dilemma?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately begin searching for a replacement therapy animal similar to Daisy.",
                "Inform the client about Daisy's retirement and prepare for termination of services.",
                "Identify the core ethical principles in conflict and gather all relevant information.",
                "Consult with Daisy's veterinarian for a definitive retirement timeline."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to ethical decision-making models (L7), the first step in addressing a complex dilemma is to clearly identify the ethical principles in conflict (e.g., client beneficence vs. animal welfare) and gather all pertinent information from all stakeholders (client, animal, supervisor, vet). This foundational step ensures a comprehensive and thoughtful approach."

            "options": [
                "Attending a marketing workshop for AAT services.",
                "Engaging in regular, structured supervision with an experienced AAT professional or clinical supervisor.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regular, structured supervision is paramount for continuous ethical development (L8). It provides an opportunity to discuss complex cases, ethical dilemmas, reinforce professional boundaries, and receive feedback, ensuring the coach's practice remains aligned with professional standards and ethical guidelines."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client expresses concern about the cost of AAT and mentions they are struggling financially. The AAT coach offers a reduced fee based on the client's income. Which core ethical principle from L1 is primarily being upheld by this action?",
            "options": [
                "Non-maleficence",
                "Fidelity",
                "Justice",
                "Veracity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The principle of justice (L1) emphasizes fairness and equity in access to services. Offering a reduced fee or sliding scale helps to ensure that financial barriers do not unfairly prevent clients from accessing necessary and beneficial AAT services, thus promoting equitable treatment."

            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "An AAT coach, certified in canine-assisted therapy, is asked to incorporate a client's horse into sessions. The coach has no specific training or experience in equine-assisted interventions. According to L4: Professional Competence, what is the most ethical course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the request and learn on the job by reading books.",
                "Accept the request but only conduct ground-based activities with the horse.",
                "Decline the request due to lack of competence and refer the client to a qualified equine-assisted therapy professional, or seek appropriate training and supervision.",
                "Accept the request, provided the client signs an additional waiver acknowledging the coach's limited experience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional competence (L4) dictates that practitioners should only provide services for which they are qualified by education, training, and supervised experience. Working with a species outside one's area of competence (e.g., horses when only trained for canines) is unethical and potentially unsafe for both client and animal. The coach should decline and refer, or obtain the necessary specialized training and supervision."
