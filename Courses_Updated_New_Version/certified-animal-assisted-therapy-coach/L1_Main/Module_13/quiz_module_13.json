            "options": [
                "Solely focusing on the client's stated problems and symptoms.",
                "Incorporating the client's strengths, existing resources, and readiness for change.",
                "Prioritizing the animal's preferred activities above client needs.",
                "Relying exclusively on standardized psychological assessments without client input."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced client assessment in AAT emphasizes a holistic, client-centered approach. Incorporating a client's strengths, resources, and readiness for change is crucial for developing collaborative, realistic, and highly motivating goals, as detailed in L1: Advanced Client Assessment and Collaborative Goal Setting."

            "question": "A client in an AAT session suddenly withdraws their hand from petting the dog and shifts their gaze away. The dog responds by turning its head slightly and licking its lips. According to the principles of enhanced observational acuity (L2), what is the most appropriate immediate interpretation of the dog's behavior?",
            "options": [
                "The dog is becoming bored and needs a break from the interaction.",
                "The dog is mirroring the client's withdrawal and is also disengaging.",
                "The dog is exhibiting a subtle stress signal, indicating discomfort or a need for space.",
                "The dog is seeking attention from the handler after the client's action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lip licking and a slight head turn (often accompanied by 'whale eye' if visible) are common subtle stress signals in canines. In this context, the dog is likely reacting to the client's withdrawal, indicating it may feel uncomfortable or need a break, aligning with the advanced animal behavior insights from L2 and L6."

            "question": "For a client with a history of complex trauma and PTSD, which AAT intervention strategy is most critical for fostering a sense of safety, predictability, and co-regulation within the session, as outlined in L3?",
            "options": [
                "Introducing multiple animals to encourage diverse and stimulating interactions.",
                "Maintaining a consistent session routine, clear behavioral boundaries, and predictable interactions with the animal.",
                "Encouraging spontaneous, unstructured play with the animal to promote catharsis.",
                "Focusing solely on physical touch interactions with the animal to build immediate rapport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For trauma survivors, predictability, safety, and clear boundaries are paramount. A consistent routine and predictable interactions with the animal help establish a secure environment, which is essential for co-regulation and healing, as discussed in L3: Tailoring AAT Interventions for Trauma and PTSD."

            "question": "When adapting AAT for a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who exhibits sensory sensitivities, which modification would be most effective to ensure positive engagement and prevent overload, according to L4?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the animal consistently provides strong, deep pressure input throughout the session.",
                "Using an animal with a very loud bark or sudden movements to gain and maintain attention.",
                "Introducing the animal in a controlled, quiet environment with gradual, optional sensory exposure and clear expectations.",
                "Encouraging fast-paced, highly unpredictable interactions with the animal to stimulate novel responses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For individuals with ASD and sensory sensitivities, a controlled, quiet environment and gradual, optional sensory exposure are crucial. This approach prevents sensory overload and allows the child to engage at their own pace, fostering positive interactions, as detailed in L4: AAT for Neurodevelopmental Disorders."

            "question": "An AAT coach discovers that a client, whose child is receiving AAT for social anxiety, has started volunteering at the coach's private animal rescue, creating a <span class=\"highlight\">dual relationship</span>. According to L5 on navigating ethical dilemmas, what is the most ethically sound course of action for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Allow the volunteering to continue, as it benefits the rescue and the client feels connected.",
                "Discuss the potential for conflict of interest and boundary issues transparently with the client, and collaboratively seek an alternative arrangement or referral for volunteering.",
                "Immediately terminate AAT sessions with the child due to the unavoidable conflict of interest.",
                "Ask the client to keep their volunteering a secret from others to avoid ethical scrutiny."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Navigating dual relationships requires transparency and ethical deliberation. The most ethically sound approach is to discuss the potential conflict of interest and boundary implications with the client, and then collaboratively work towards a solution, which might involve finding an alternative volunteer role for the client or a referral, prioritizing client welfare and professional boundaries, as emphasized in L5: Navigating Ethical Dilemmas and Professional Boundaries."

            "options": [
                "A vigorous, high tail wag with a relaxed body.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequent lip licking, yawning outside of a tired context, and 'whale eye' are classic subtle stress signals in dogs. Recognizing these nuanced behaviors is vital for AAT professionals to ensure animal welfare and adapt interventions, as thoroughly covered in L6: Advanced Animal Behavior, Welfare, and Stress Signals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The logic model is a systematic framework used in program development to articulate the theory of change. It clearly maps out how program inputs lead to activities, which produce specific outputs, and ultimately result in desired short-term and long-term outcomes, serving as a blueprint for program design and evaluation, as taught in L7: Program Development, Implementation, and Outcome Measurement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' in the SMART-ER framework for goal setting specifically emphasizes Ethical considerations. This ensures that goals are not only achievable and relevant but also align with professional ethics, client welfare, and animal welfare, a critical aspect of advanced practice discussed in L1 and L5."

            "question": "In AAT program outcome measurement, what is the primary advantage of using a <span class=\"highlight\">mixed-methods approach</span> (combining quantitative and qualitative data), as advocated in L7?",
            "options": [
                "It significantly reduces the overall cost and time investment for data collection.",
                "It provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of program impact by capturing both statistical significance and lived experiences.",
                "It simplifies the process of data analysis for program evaluators and stakeholders.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A mixed-methods approach combines the breadth and statistical power of quantitative data with the depth and contextual understanding of qualitative data. This allows for a much richer, more comprehensive evaluation of program impact, capturing both 'what' happened and 'why' or 'how' it happened, as detailed in L7: Program Development, Implementation, and Outcome Measurement."
