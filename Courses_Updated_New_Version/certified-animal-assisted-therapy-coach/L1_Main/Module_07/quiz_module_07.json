            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Option C is the only SMART goal: Specific (practice presenting, 5 mins, eye contact), Measurable (twice a week, four weeks, 60% eye contact), Achievable (realistic practice), Relevant (addresses anxiety), and Time-bound (four weeks).

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These behaviors (head turns, yawning, lip licking) are common canine calming signals or signs of stress/discomfort. An AAT Coach should interpret these as indications that the dog is uncomfortable and adjust the interaction to ensure animal welfare and safety, as taught in L6."
