            "question": "Which of the following observations provides the strongest evidence of an <span class=\"highlight\">evolving human-animal bond</span> between a client and a therapy animal over multiple sessions?",
            "options": [
                "The client consistently offers the animal treats at the start of each session.",
                "The client and animal increasingly engage in mutual gaze, initiate physical closeness, and respond reciprocally to each other's cues.",
                "The client frequently asks the handler questions about the animal's breed.",
                "The client tolerates the animal's presence without active interaction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The development of a strong human-animal bond is characterized by mutual engagement, demonstrated through behaviors like mutual gaze, seeking and accepting physical closeness, and reciprocal responses to social cues, indicating a deeper connection beyond superficial interaction."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "After several sessions, a coach synthesizes observational data: the client's non-verbal indicators of anxiety (e.g., fidgeting, averted gaze) have decreased by <span class=\"highlight\">35%</span>, while instances of positive verbalizations directed at the animal have increased by <span class=\"highlight\">50%</span>. The therapy animal consistently exhibits relaxed body language during interactions. What is the most appropriate initial interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The client is showing signs of boredom with the AAT sessions.",
                "The AAT intervention is likely having a positive impact on the client's anxiety and engagement.",
                "The therapy animal is overly passive and not stimulating enough for the client.",
                "The client requires a more structured, goal-oriented intervention immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A decrease in anxiety indicators coupled with an increase in positive engagement and a relaxed therapy animal strongly suggests that the AAT intervention is positively influencing the client's emotional state and therapeutic participation."

                "Establish a clear starting point for client behaviors and interactions against which future progress can be measured.",
                "Determine the client's eligibility for advanced therapy techniques.",
                "Minimize the need for ongoing documentation throughout the intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A baseline assessment is crucial for establishing a reference point of a client's behaviors, interactions, and emotional states before intervention. This allows the coach to objectively track progress, measure the effectiveness of interventions, and adjust strategies as needed over time."

                "Indicates that the session is nearing its end."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapy animal's positive, reciprocal response (leaning into touch, soft gaze) provides immediate, non-judgmental affirmation to the client. For someone with social anxiety, this can be profoundly reassuring, reducing apprehension and encouraging further engagement and interaction, thereby strengthening the human-animal bond."
