            "question": "When designing a tailored Animal-Assisted Intervention (AAI) for a client with social anxiety, which assessment factor is most crucial for selecting the appropriate animal partner?",
            "options": [
                "Animal's breed and size",
                "Animal's training certification level and years of experience",
                "Animal's temperament, comfort with novel social situations, and handler's ability to interpret stress signals",
                "Animal's age and vaccination records"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The animal's temperament and its comfort in various social situations, coupled with the handler's ability to recognize and respond to the animal's stress signals, are paramount for ensuring a safe and effective tailored intervention, especially for clients with specific anxieties."

            "question": "During an AAI session, a client spontaneously shares a past trauma after observing the therapy animal's gentle nature. According to immediate processing principles, what is the coach's most appropriate initial response?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately pivot to a cognitive reframing exercise to shift focus from the trauma.",
                "Validate the client's feelings, acknowledge their courage, and create a safe, supportive space for brief exploration while monitoring client and animal comfort.",
                "Redirect the client back to the planned activity to maintain session structure and avoid unexpected topics.",
                "Document the trauma detail for later referral to a specialist and avoid further discussion in the current session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Immediate processing emphasizes validating the client's spontaneous disclosures and creating a safe container for emotional expression. While deeper processing or referral may be necessary, the initial response is to acknowledge and support the client in the moment."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client consistently describes themselves as 'unlovable' after their therapy dog briefly moves away from them to sniff another area. To facilitate cognitive reframing in this scenario, the coach might most effectively ask:",
            "options": [
                "\"What did the dog do immediately before moving away?\"",
                "\"How does the dog's behavior directly confirm your core belief about being unlovable?\"",
                "\"Can you identify another possible, less personal reason for the dog's movement, perhaps related to its natural curiosity or environment?\"",
                "\"Have you tried to make the dog stay closer to you?\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reframing involves helping the client challenge negative interpretations by exploring alternative, more realistic explanations for events. This question prompts them to consider non-personal reasons for the animal's behavior, thereby de-catastrophizing the situation."

                "Provide a detailed written summary of their progress and encourage self-reflection.",
                "Role-play assertive communication scenarios exclusively with the coach, without the animal present.",
                "Collaboratively identify specific, low-stakes situations outside the session where the client can apply the skill, and develop a practice plan with follow-up.",
                "Increase the duration of subsequent AAI sessions to provide more practice opportunities with the animal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Skill generalization requires intentional planning to transfer learned behaviors from the therapy context to daily life. Identifying and planning for real-world application, coupled with follow-up, is crucial for successful transfer."

            "question": "During an AAI session, the therapy animal suddenly shows subtle signs of stress (e.g., yawning, lip-licking, turning away, tail tucked) in response to a client's energetic, somewhat overwhelming interaction. What is the coach's immediate priority?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to continue their interaction to desensitize the animal to high energy.",
                "Immediately remove the animal from the session and end early to prevent further stress.",
                "Intervene calmly and promptly to modify the client's interaction, ensuring the animal's welfare and teaching the client about animal communication.",
                "Document the animal's behavior and discuss it with the client at the beginning of the next session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ensuring the therapy animal's welfare is always the immediate priority. The coach must intervene to protect the animal from stress and use the moment as a teaching opportunity for the client about respecting animal boundaries and communication."

                "Client self-report during informal debriefing at the end of each session.",
                "The coach's subjective observational notes and anecdotal records of client demeanor.",
                "Pre- and post-intervention administration of a validated, standardized anxiety scale (e.g., GAD-7, BAI), allowing for measurable symptom change.",
                "Anecdotal feedback collected from the client's family members or support network."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validated, standardized scales provide objective, quantitative data that can be statistically analyzed to demonstrate measurable changes in symptoms, offering the most robust evidence for intervention efficacy."
