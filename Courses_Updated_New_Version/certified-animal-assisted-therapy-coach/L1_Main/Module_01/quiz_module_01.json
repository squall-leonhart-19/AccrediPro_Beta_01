            "question": "According to the principles of effective therapeutic goal setting (L3), a client states, 'I want to feel less anxious.' How should an AAT Coach best refine this goal using the SMART framework?",
            "options": [
                "\"Client will report feeling less anxious after each session.\"",
                "\"Client will reduce self-reported anxiety scores by 20% on the GAD-7 scale within 8 weeks, participating in weekly AAT sessions focused on relaxation techniques.\"",
                "\"Client will engage more with the therapy animal to distract from anxiety.\"",
                "\"Client will learn coping mechanisms to manage anxiety symptoms effectively.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Option B is the most 'SMART' goal: Specific (20% reduction, GAD-7), Measurable (GAD-7 scores), Achievable (20% is realistic), Relevant (relaxation techniques in AAT), and Time-bound (within 8 weeks). The others are too vague or lack specific metrics."

            "question": "In the initial client engagement phase (L2), what is the primary purpose of conducting a thorough intake interview and history assessment before discussing AAT integration?",
            "options": [
                "To determine the client's financial capacity for AAT services.",
                "To establish a baseline for measuring the therapy animal's performance.",
                "To identify potential contraindications, existing mental/physical health conditions, and client expectations to ensure safe and appropriate AAT integration.",
                "To immediately match the client with the most popular therapy animal available."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A thorough intake interview (L2) is crucial for understanding the client's holistic needs, identifying any contraindications (e.g., allergies, phobias, past trauma), and aligning expectations before matching with an animal or setting goals. Safety and appropriateness are paramount."

            "question": "When assessing client needs for AAT integration (L4), a coach learns a client has a significant fear of large dogs due to a past traumatic incident. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action?",
            "options": [
                "Insist that exposure to a large, gentle dog will help them overcome their fear.",
                "Dismiss AAT as unsuitable for this client.",
                "Explore the client's comfort level with other animal species or smaller dogs, and consider desensitization strategies within a carefully managed plan.",
                "Refer the client to a different therapist who specializes in phobias."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A skilled AAT coach (L4) will adapt the intervention. While direct exposure might be therapeutic later, the initial step is to respect the client's current comfort level and explore alternatives (different species, smaller animals) or gradual desensitization, rather than forcing exposure or immediately dismissing AAT."

            "question": "According to L5, when matching a therapy animal to a client with severe non-verbal autism whose primary goal is to improve social engagement, which animal characteristic is paramount?",
            "options": [
                "The animal's breed lineage and pedigree.",
                "The animal's ability to perform complex tricks on command.",
                "The animal's calm, predictable temperament, high tolerance for novel stimuli, and ability to initiate gentle, non-threatening interaction.",
                "The animal's size and weight, ensuring it is a large, imposing presence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a client with severe non-verbal autism aiming for social engagement (L5), a calm, predictable animal with high tolerance and a gentle interactive style is crucial. This minimizes overstimulation and fosters a safe environment for connection, promoting positive social interaction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While measurable outcomes are important for client progress, comprehensive safety protocols are paramount for the immediate well-being of both the client and the therapy animal (L6). This includes understanding animal behavior, recognizing stress signals, and having clear emergency plans."

                "The client's favorite type of animal.",
                "The number of times the client smiles during an AAT session.",
                "A validated social isolation scale (e.g., UCLA Loneliness Scale) administered prior to intervention, or a daily log of social interactions.",
                "The therapy animal's weight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To establish an effective quantitative baseline for social isolation (L7), using a validated scale like the UCLA Loneliness Scale or tracking objective measures like daily social interactions provides measurable data points against which future progress can be compared."

            "options": [
                "To obtain a verbal agreement from the client to participate in AAT.",
                "To ensure the client fully understands the nature, risks, benefits, and alternatives of AAT, and voluntarily agrees to participate after receiving clear, comprehensive information.",
                "To inform the client only about the positive benefits of AAT.",
                "To obtain consent only from the client's legal guardian, regardless of the client's capacity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent (L8) requires more than just agreement; it demands that the client (or their guardian, if applicable) has a complete understanding of all aspects of the intervention – benefits, risks, alternatives, and confidentiality – and freely chooses to participate without coercion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core of AAT coaching (L1) is its intentionality and structure. It's not just about interacting with animals, but about leveraging that interaction within a therapeutic framework to achieve specific, pre-determined client goals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical animal welfare (L8) in AAT demands constant vigilance for the animal's well-being. This includes recognizing stress signals, ensuring adequate rest, and advocating for the animal's needs, preventing it from being over-worked or put into uncomfortable situations."

            "question": "After several weeks of AAT sessions, a client's scores on a self-efficacy scale have improved by 15%, and observational notes indicate increased verbalization during animal interactions. According to L7, how should an AAT coach interpret this data?",
            "options": [
                "The AAT intervention has failed, as a 15% improvement is insignificant.",
                "The client is showing positive progress towards their self-efficacy and communication goals, warranting continuation or slight adjustment of the intervention plan.",
                "The data is irrelevant because self-efficacy scales are subjective.",
                "The animal is likely performing too many tricks, causing client improvement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 15% improvement on a validated scale, coupled with positive qualitative observations, indicates meaningful progress (L7). The coach should interpret this as a positive outcome, affirming the effectiveness of the intervention and potentially informing adjustments for further growth."
