                "Focusing exclusively on short-term, observable interactions with the therapy animal.",
                "Prioritizing long-term independence goals, deferring immediate symptom management.",
                "Developing hierarchical, measurable micro-goals that address both trauma symptoms and social anxiety, integrating client-reported priorities.",
                "Delegating all goal setting to the multidisciplinary team without direct client input."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For complex client needs, effective goal blueprinting requires developing hierarchical and measurable micro-goals that address multiple comorbidities. Integrating client priorities ensures a client-centered approach, enhancing engagement and therapeutic alliance."

            "question": "During an AAT session with a child diagnosed with selective mutism, the therapy dog frequently nudges the child's hand with its nose, and the child occasionally makes soft, non-verbal sounds while petting the dog. Based on the nuances of observation in diverse AAT settings, what is the most critical interpretation for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "The dog's nudges are a direct command for the child to attempt verbal communication.",
                "The child's non-verbal sounds are irrelevant to the therapeutic process.",
                "These non-verbal interactions signify significant progress in the child's comfort and connection, laying groundwork for future communication.",
                "The dog needs to be redirected immediately to prevent overstimulation of the child."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In cases like selective mutism, subtle non-verbal cues from both client and animal are crucial. Recognizing these interactions as indicators of comfort and connection is vital progress, even without verbal output, aligning with client-paced engagement."

                "Relying on the animal to provide all therapeutic interventions, replacing traditional CBT techniques."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrating AAT with CBT can be highly effective. The animal can serve as a co-regulator, providing a grounding presence during exposure exercises, helping to reframe anxious thoughts, and facilitating the practice of coping skills, thereby enhancing CBT outcomes for anxiety."

A 2023 meta-analysis of AAT outcome measures (n=7,800) suggests that a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">25% reduction in SIB frequency</span> observed over a 4-week period is a clinically significant indicator of progress. How should the coach best document this observation to reflect measurable progress?",
