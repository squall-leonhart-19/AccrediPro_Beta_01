            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A client, Emily, undergoing AAT for severe depression, develops an intense, almost obsessive attachment to the therapy dog, 'Buddy,' expressing that Buddy is her 'only true friend.' This attachment begins to impede her willingness to engage with human therapists or build social connections outside of AAT sessions. This scenario presents a significant ethical dilemma primarily related to:",
            "options": [
                "Beneficence, as the client is receiving comfort.",
                "Non-maleficence, if the attachment is hindering overall therapeutic progress.",
                "Autonomy, as the client is choosing her preferred form of connection.",
                "Fidelity, as the coach is committed to the client's well-being."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the client finds comfort, the intense attachment to the animal impeding broader therapeutic goals (like human social connection) raises a non-maleficence concern. The AAT coach must ensure the intervention is not inadvertently causing harm or hindering overall progress, as explored in L5."

                "Having the client practice exposure to social situations by first interacting with the therapy animal in a controlled setting, then gradually introducing human interaction facilitated by the animal's presence.",
                "Exclusively focusing on the animal's behavior, ignoring the client's cognitive distortions.",
                "Prescribing the therapy animal as a replacement for human social interaction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating AAT with CBT for social anxiety often involves using the therapy animal as a 'safe' bridge. Clients can practice social skills, communication, and exposure in a low-threat environment with the animal before transferring these skills to human interactions, directly addressing cognitive and behavioral components of anxiety, as discussed in L6."
