            "options": [
                "It only focuses on animal behavior.",
                "It includes a \"Therapeutic Impact\" component, ensuring alignment with client-specific clinical outcomes.",
                "It is exclusively used for short-term interventions.",
                "It requires the animal to perform complex tasks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The \"T\" in SMART-T stands for Therapeutic Impact, emphasizing that goals must directly link to observable, measurable client progress and clinical outcomes, moving beyond simple task completion.

To <span class=\"highlight\">process this experience and nurture growth</span>, which reflective question would be most effective for linking the interaction to the client's broader emotional landscape?",
            "options": [
                "\"Why do you think the rabbit moved?\"",
                "\"What feelings did you notice when the rabbit moved, and have you experienced similar feelings in other situations?\"",
                "\"Did you pet the rabbit correctly?\"",
                "\"Let's try petting a different animal.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This question uses open-ended inquiry to connect the client's immediate emotional response to the animal's behavior with their wider emotional patterns, facilitating deeper self-awareness and processing of core issues, a key aspect of nurturing growth through reflection.
