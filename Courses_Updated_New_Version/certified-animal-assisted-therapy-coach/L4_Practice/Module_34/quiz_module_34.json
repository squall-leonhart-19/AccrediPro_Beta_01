            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open-ended questions can invite shy participants to speak, while gentle redirection (e.g., 'Thank you for sharing, John, let's hear from others now') can manage dominant voices without shutting them down, fostering equitable participation."
