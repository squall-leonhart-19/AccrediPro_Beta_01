            "options": [
                "Developing a general marketing campaign for all age groups and conditions.",
                "Focusing on building a niche specialization in AAT for children with anxiety.",

                "Investing heavily in broad advertising without specific targeting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying an underserved market segment with specific needs, like children with anxiety, strongly supports developing a niche specialization. This allows the practitioner to tailor their services, messaging, and marketing efforts to effectively reach and serve that specific demographic, leading to higher client acquisition and impact."

The practitioner should leverage this insight by increasing the production of similar video content to further engage potential clients and showcase the practical benefits and unique aspects of AAT."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While covering operational costs is fundamental, effective pricing also considers the perceived value of the specialized AAT services and the practitioner's unique expertise. This approach ensures sustainable growth, reflects the quality of care, and positions the practice appropriately in the market, rather than simply competing on price."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing in therapeutic fields, including AAT, strictly prohibits guaranteeing specific outcomes or 'cures.' Therapeutic results are highly individualized and depend on many factors beyond the practitioner's control. Making such claims is misleading, creates false hope, and can harm client trust and professional integrity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
