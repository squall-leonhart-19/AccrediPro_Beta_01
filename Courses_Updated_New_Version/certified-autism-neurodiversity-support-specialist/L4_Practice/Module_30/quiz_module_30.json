            "id": "q30_1",
            "question": "When defining a 'Neuro-Affirming Niche' (L1), what is the primary benefit of narrowing your focus to a specific intersection (e.g., Autistic ADHDers in corporate leadership)?",
            "options": [
                "It allows you to charge the highest possible fees in the market.",
                "It reduces the need for continuing education in other areas.",
                "It establishes deep expertise and reduces the cognitive load of switching between vastly different client needs.",
                "It ensures that you will never face competition from generalist coaches."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Niche specialization allows for the development of deep, specialized expertise and creates a more sustainable workflow by reducing the 'context switching' required when working with unrelated populations."

        {
            "id": "q30_2",
            "question": "In the context of Ethical Frameworks (L2), what is the 'Gold Standard' for managing dual relationships in small neurodivergent communities?",
            "options": [
                "Strict avoidance of any community interaction outside of sessions.",
                "Clear disclosure, documented boundary agreements, and ongoing discussion of power dynamics.",
                "Ignoring the dual relationship as long as it happens in a digital space.",
                "Only working with clients who are not part of your social or local community."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because neurodivergent communities are often tight-knit, 'absolute' avoidance is often impossible; therefore, the ethical standard is transparency, documentation, and proactive boundary management."
        },
        {
            "id": "q30_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a core requirement for a 'Neuro-Inclusive Business Model' (L3)?",
            "options": [
                "Requiring all clients to use video during consultations to ensure engagement.",
                "Implementing 'Asynchronous-First' communication options to reduce executive function tax.",
                "A strict 24-hour cancellation policy with no exceptions for sensory meltdowns.",
                "Using only high-contrast, bright primary colors in all digital interfaces."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-inclusive models prioritize reducing executive function barriers; asynchronous communication (email, voice notes) allows clients to process information at their own pace without the pressure of real-time interaction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q30_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Authentic Marketing, why is 'Inspiration Porn' (portraying neurodivergent people as heroic for simply existing) considered unethical?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive to produce in a marketing campaign.",
                "It fails to generate enough clicks from neurotypical audiences.",
                "It objectifies neurodivergent individuals for the emotional benefit of neurotypical observers.",
                "It is legally prohibited under the ADA marketing guidelines."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Authentic marketing avoids objectification. Inspiration porn positions the neurodivergent person as a tool for neurotypical 'inspiration' rather than a human being with agency and complex needs."

            "id": "q30_5",
            "question": "In the B.R.I.D.G.E. Intake Framework (L5), what does the 'D' represent?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnosis (Confirming medical paperwork)",
                "Differences (Sensory, communication, and cognitive profiles)",

                "Duration (Deciding how long the contract will last)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The B.R.I.D.G.E. framework uses 'Differences' to map the client's unique neuro-profile (sensory, processing, and communication) rather than focusing on a deficit-based medical model."
        },
        {
            "id": "q30_6",
            "question": "When implementing 'Sustainable Pricing' (L6), what is the purpose of a 'Community Support Tier'?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a free service to everyone in the local area.",
                "To allow higher-income clients to subsidize lower-cost spots for marginalized community members.",
                "To ensure the coach makes the same amount of money from every single client.",
                "To bypass the need for paying business taxes on low-income revenue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Equity-based or sliding scale pricing models often use a 'redistributive' approach where the 'Full Fee' or 'Pay It Forward' tiers sustain the availability of lower-cost spots for those with systemic barriers."

        {
            "id": "q30_7",
            "question": "A practitioner wants to scale their impact using the 'One-to-Many' model (L7). What is a common 'Neuro-Inclusive' challenge when designing a digital course?",
            "options": [
                "Digital courses are too expensive to host on modern platforms.",
                "Neurodivergent students may struggle with 'self-paced' structures without body doubling or executive function support.",
                "Courses are generally less effective than one-on-one coaching for all topics.",
                "It is illegal to teach neuro-affirming concepts in a group format."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While courses scale well, practitioners must account for the 'executive function gap' by including guided schedules, body-doubling sessions, or bite-sized content to ensure neurodivergent students succeed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q30_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Professional Longevity.' What is the 'Double Empathy Problem's' relevance to practitioner burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Practitioners burn out because they care too much about their clients.",
                "Burnout occurs when there is a persistent mismatch in communication styles and expectations between the practitioner and the community.",
                "Practitioners only burn out if they are neurotypical.",
                "Double Empathy refers to the stress of having two different jobs at once."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a professional context, longevity is threatened when a practitioner (often neurotypical) fails to bridge the empathy gap, leading to frustration, 'compliance-based' goals, and eventual exhaustion for both parties."
        },
        {
            "id": "q30_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Inertia' and struggles to start the intake forms. Using 'Workflow Optimization' (L5), what is the best intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Charge a late fee to motivate them to complete the forms.",
                "Cancel the intake and tell them to return when they are 'ready to work.'",
                "Offer a 'Live Intake' session where you fill out the forms together via screen share.",
                "Send more frequent automated email reminders every 4 hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-inclusive workflow optimization recognizes 'Inertia' as a physiological barrier. Offering a 'Live Intake' or 'Body Doubling' session removes the executive function hurdle of the form."

            "id": "q30_10",
            "question": "Which metric is most important for 'Sustainable Growth' in a neuro-affirming practice (L6/L8)?",
            "options": [
                "Total number of followers on social media.",
                "The 'Retention-to-Referral' ratio and practitioner energy capacity.",
                "Gross revenue before any expenses or taxes.",
                "The number of hours spent working per week (the more the better)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable growth is measured by the quality of the client relationship (retention/referrals) and the practitioner's 'Energy Capacity'—ensuring the business does not outpace the human's ability to provide regulated, high-quality support."
