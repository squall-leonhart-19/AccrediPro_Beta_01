            "options": [
                "Teaching participants to mask their autistic traits more effectively in public",
                "Shifting from 'fixing' social deficits to fostering authentic neuro-kinship and mutual understanding",
                "Prioritizing the reduction of repetitive behaviors to improve group cohesion",
                "Ensuring all participants achieve the same standardized social milestones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The neuro-affirming paradigm rejects the idea of 'social deficits' and instead focuses on neuro-kinship, where participants are supported in developing authentic connections based on their natural communication styles."

            "question": "When conducting 'Group Baseline Profiling' (L2), why is it critical to assess the 'Sensory Load Threshold' of the collective group?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the facilitator can maximize the volume of background music",
                "To identify the individual with the highest tolerance and make them the group leader",
                "To prevent 'contagious dysregulation' by ensuring the environment does not exceed the group's cumulative sensory capacity",
                "To determine which participants should be removed from the program for being too sensitive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing the collective Sensory Load Threshold allows facilitators to design an environment that prevents group-wide dysregulation, which can occur when the sensory environment overwhelms multiple participants simultaneously."

                "A place for participants to be sent as a punishment for non-compliance",
                "A high-stimulus area designed to increase heart rate and energy",
                "A low-stimulus, 'opt-out' space that allows participants to self-regulate while remaining in the vicinity of the group",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Decompression Zone is a vital neuro-affirming design element that allows participants to manage their sensory needs and self-regulate without the shame of having to 'leave' the session entirely."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Regulate & Resonate' model prioritizes co-regulation and a low-arousal approach to maintain safety and dignity for the individual while keeping the rest of the group grounded."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-modularization is a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) strategy that helps neurodivergent learners process information without becoming overwhelmed by excessive cognitive load."

                "Compliance-based goals are more effective for long-term mental health",
                "Growth-oriented goals prioritize the comfort of neurotypical observers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming goals (Growth-Oriented) prioritize the participant's autonomy and their own values, rather than forcing them to comply with neurotypical social norms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Core Fidelity ensures the program remains safe and neuro-affirming (the 'non-negotiables') while allowing trainers to adapt the delivery to the specific needs of their local group."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming outcome measurement focuses on internal states and quality of life indicators, such as belonging and self-advocacy, rather than external behavioral suppression."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "Case Study Application: You are facilitating a workshop where two participants have conflicting sensory needs—one needs movement (vestibular seeking), and the other is distracted by movement (visual over-responsivity). What is the best solution?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the movement-seeker to sit still for the duration of the 3-hour workshop",
                "Create a 'Movement Station' at the back of the room and use privacy screens or seating arrangements to minimize visual distraction for others",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A neuro-affirming facilitator uses environmental engineering (like seating and screens) to honor both participants' needs simultaneously without pathologizing either."

            "options": [
                "It reduces the cost of the program because mentors don't need to be paid",
                "Mentors provide 'lived-experience validation' that helps participants feel understood in a way that non-divergent staff cannot replicate",
                "Mentors are better at enforcing strict discipline in the group",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent mentors provide 'lived-experience validation,' acting as role models and providing a depth of empathy and understanding that significantly enhances the impact of group programs."
