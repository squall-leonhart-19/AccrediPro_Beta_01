            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Boundary Recognition (B) involves understanding the limits of one's own professional role while acknowledging where other disciplines intersect to provide seamless, non-conflicting support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Social Cliff' refers to the sudden drop-off in supports after leaving the education system, combined with workplace environments that fail to provide sensory or communication accommodations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Low Arousal Approach focuses on 'de-escalating the environment' by reducing the practitioner's physiological and emotional intensity to help the client coregulate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Glass Child' phenomenon describes siblings who feel their needs are invisible or secondary to the intensive support requirements of their neurodivergent brother or sister."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because neurodivergent adults often use high levels of 'compensatory effort' daily, even minor age-related cognitive decline can lead to a more significant loss of functional independence."

            "id": "q12_6",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-tech AT involves complex electronic or digital systems, such as eye-tracking, robust AAC apps, or specialized software, whereas weighted items and laminated cards are low-tech."

            "options": [
                "There is no distinction; both are equally harmful.",
                "A violation is a harmful breach of ethics; a crossing is a deviation from standard practice that may be clinically helpful and neuro-affirming.",
                "A crossing is always illegal, while a violation is only a suggestion.",
                "Violations are only committed by therapists, while crossings are committed by clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A boundary crossing (e.g., meeting a client in a sensory-friendly park instead of a clinic) can be a deliberate, neuro-affirming choice, whereas a violation (e.g., financial exploitation) is inherently harmful."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming metrics focus on quality of life, autonomy, and self-advocacy rather than the suppression of harmless neurodivergent traits or compliance with neurotypical norms."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "In a case study involving a 19-year-old transitioning to a digital workspace, which 'Universal Design for Learning' (UDL) principle is applied when providing both written instructions and video tutorials?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Providing information in different formats (text and video) is a core example of 'Multiple Means of Representation,' allowing the individual to consume data in the way their brain processes it best."
