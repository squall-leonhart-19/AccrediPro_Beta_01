            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "According to the Neuro-Transition Model (L1), what is the primary physiological shift that occurs when an autistic individual moves from a structured school environment to adulthood?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in cortisol production due to reduced academic pressure",
                "A shift from 'External Regulation' (provided by school/parents) to a sudden demand for 'Internal Regulation'",
                "The complete maturation of the Prefrontal Cortex by age 21",
                "An immediate increase in interoceptive awareness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neuro-Transition Model highlights that the loss of external scaffolding (schedules, prompts, and adult oversight) forces a sudden reliance on internal executive function and self-regulation, often leading to physiological dysregulation."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the transition from Higher Education (IDEA) to the Workplace (ADA), what is the most significant change in the legal 'burden of responsibility' (L2)?",
            "options": [
                "The employer is now required to seek out the individual's needs via an IEP",
                "The individual must now provide their own transportation to all sites",
                "The burden shifts from the institution (finding the student) to the individual (disclosing and requesting accommodations)",
                "There is no legal difference; ADA and IDEA provide identical protections"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under IDEA, schools are responsible for identifying students with disabilities. Under the ADA (Higher Ed and Employment), the individual is responsible for disclosing their disability and requesting specific 'reasonable accommodations.'"

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client is preparing for a job interview. Which 'Workplace Integration' strategy (L3) involves the individual requesting the interview questions in advance to reduce cognitive load?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Requesting interview questions in advance is a specific executive function accommodation that allows autistic candidates to process information and formulate responses without the added stress of real-time social processing."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "When scaffolding the 'Big 5' of Independent Living (L4), which area refers to the management of 'Executive Resource Depletion' caused by sensory overstimulation in the home?",
            "options": [
                "Housing & Environment",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Housing & Environment involves creating a 'sensory sanctuary' to prevent depletion. If the home environment is sensory-taxing, the individual will lack the executive resources needed for the other four pillars of adulting."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unmasking is the intentional reduction of camouflaging (hiding autistic traits). While it may present social risks, it is essential for long-term burnout prevention and authentic intimacy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'EF Tax' refers to the extra money spent on things like late fees, lost items, or convenience services (like pre-cut vegetables or delivery) that an individual uses to bypass executive functioning hurdles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic Overshadowing is a significant barrier where healthcare providers incorrectly assume that physical health complaints are merely manifestations of the patient's developmental disability or 'anxiety.'"

            "question": "According to Lesson 8, how does 'Autistic Burnout' differ from Clinical Depression?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is caused by a chemical imbalance, while depression is situational",
                "Burnout is primarily driven by chronic 'masking' and sensory overload, whereas depression involves a loss of interest (anhedonia)",
                "They are medically identical and treated with the same SSRI protocols",
                "Burnout only occurs in children, while depression only occurs in adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While they can co-occur, Autistic Burnout is a state of physical and mental exhaustion caused by the long-term cumulative load of navigating a world not built for neurodivergent brains, often characterized by a loss of previously mastered skills."

                "Focusing exclusively on financial savings before addressing sensory needs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Successful transitions require 'Fading Scaffolds,' where support is gradually removed in stages rather than all at once, ensuring the individual's nervous system isn't overwhelmed by the sudden change."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A 24-year-old client reports they are 'too tired to eat' after work and often forgets to shower. Based on Module 11, this is most likely a sign of:",

                "The natural 'laziness' associated with the transition to adulthood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When an individual is over-extended in one area (like the workplace), their executive resources for basic 'adulting' (hygiene and nutrition) are often the first to fail. This indicates a need for workplace accommodations or better sensory management."
