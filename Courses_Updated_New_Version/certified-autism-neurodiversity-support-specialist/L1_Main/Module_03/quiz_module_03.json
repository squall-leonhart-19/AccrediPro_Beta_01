            "question": "In the paradigm shift from compliance to connection, what is the primary objective of a neuro-affirming practitioner when a client exhibits 'challenging' behavior?",
            "options": [
                "To implement a reward-based system to increase desired behaviors",
                "To identify the underlying unmet need or lagging skill causing the dysregulation",
                "To ignore the behavior until the client complies with the original demand",
                "To use 'planned ignoring' to ensure the behavior is not reinforced"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The connection-based paradigm views behavior as communication of an unmet need or a lagging skill, prioritizing regulation and safety over behavioral output."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A child says 'To infinity and beyond!' every time they want to go outside. According to Lesson 2, this is an example of which language development style?",

                "Pragmatic Language Impairment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt Language Processing (GLP) involves learning language in 'chunks' or scripts (gestalts) where the meaning is tied to the original context of the phrase."

            "question": "Damian Milton's 'Double Empathy Problem' challenges the traditional view of autism by proposing that:",
            "options": [
                "Autistic individuals lack the cognitive ability to understand others' perspectives",
                "Neurotypical individuals have a superior ability to empathize with all neurotypes",
                "Communication breakdowns are a mutual, bidirectional issue between different neurotypes",
                "Empathy is a fixed trait that cannot be improved through interaction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that social difficulties are not a 'deficit' in the autistic person, but a result of a mismatch in communication styles and experiences between two different groups."

            "id": "q3_4",

                "Imposing adult-driven solutions through the use of consequences",
                "Dropping the expectation entirely to avoid conflict",
                "A collaborative process where the adult and child work together to solve a problem proactively",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Plan B is the heart of the CPS model, involving three steps: the Empathy step, the Define the Concern step, and the Invitation step to solve the problem together."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "According to the Theory of Monotropism, why might an autistic individual struggle with sudden transitions?",
            "options": [
                "Because they are intentionally being defiant or non-compliant",
                "Because their cognitive resources are concentrated in a 'tunnel' of attention, making it difficult to shift focus",
                "Because they lack the executive functioning to understand a clock",
                "Because they have a pathological demand avoidance (PDA) profile"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monotropism suggests the autistic brain focuses intensely on a limited number of interests (an 'attention tunnel'), making the 'arousal cost' of switching tasks very high."

            "id": "q3_6",

            "options": [
                "We should assume a child cannot use AAC until they prove they have 'pre-requisite' skills",
                "We should assume that using AAC will prevent a child from ever developing verbal speech",
                "We should assume competence and provide access to robust communication tools regardless of perceived ability",
                "We should only provide AAC if the child is completely non-speaking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Least Dangerous Assumption (Anne Donnellan) asserts that we should assume all learners are capable of learning and communicating, as the cost of underestimating them is far greater than the cost of overestimating them."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Research on 'social camouflaging' or masking indicates that consistently hiding autistic traits to fit into neurotypical environments is correlated with:",
            "options": [
                "Improved long-term career success and social integration",
                "Increased risk of burnout, depression, and suicidality",
                "A gradual 'curing' of autistic social deficits",
                "Higher levels of self-esteem and confidence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Cassidy et al., 2018) show that masking is a significant risk factor for mental health struggles and autistic burnout due to the immense cognitive and emotional labor involved."

            "question": "When building rapport with a neurodivergent client, which of the following practices is considered neuro-affirming?",
            "options": [
                "Insisting on sustained eye contact to ensure the client is listening",
                "Using 'Parallel Play' or 'Body Doubling' to build connection through shared space and activities",
                "Requiring the client to sit still and keep 'quiet hands' during the session",
                "Using high-pitched 'motherese' regardless of the client's chronological age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming rapport building respects autistic social signals, such as parallel play (being near each other without direct interaction) and body doubling."

            "options": [
                "Kids do well if they want to",
                "Kids do well if they can",
                "Behavior is a choice driven by motivation",
                "Consequences are the most effective way to teach skills"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CPS model is built on the belief that 'Kids do well if they can,' implying that if a child is struggling, it is due to a lack of skills, not a lack of will."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a client who uses a Speech Generating Device (AAC). The client begins to explore the buttons rapidly without a clear message. The most appropriate response is to:",
            "options": [
                "Take the device away until the client is ready to use it 'appropriately'",
                "Model the words the client is pressing and treat the exploration as 'babbling' or learning",
                "Tell the client 'No' and redirect their hands to their lap",
                "Only allow the device to be used during specific 'communication' drills"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring an AAC device is the equivalent of a neurotypical infant 'babbling.' It is a necessary stage of language acquisition and should be modeled and validated, not discouraged."
