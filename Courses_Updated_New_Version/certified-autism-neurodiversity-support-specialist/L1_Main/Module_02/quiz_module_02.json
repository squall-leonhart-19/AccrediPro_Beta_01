            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Adrenal System",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex",

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client frequently bumps into furniture and uses 'heavy-handed' pressure when writing. Which sensory system is most likely seeking additional input?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioception involves the sense of self-movement and body position; seeking 'heavy' input is a hallmark of a proprioceptive seeking profile."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that 40-50% of autistic individuals experience alexithymia, which is the difficulty identifying and describing internal emotional states."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the context of co-regulation (Lesson 4), what is the primary function of the Specialist acting as an 'Anchor'?",
            "options": [
                "To provide verbal instructions on how to calm down",
                "To use their own regulated nervous system to influence the client's state via resonance",
                "To physically restrain the client during a meltdown",
                "To ignore the behavior until the client self-regulates independently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation is a 'bottom-up' process where the Specialist’s calm presence and regulated physiology help stabilize the client’s nervous system."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Proactive' regulation strategy rather than a 'Reactive' one?",

                "Using a weighted blanket during a full-blown meltdown",
                "Offering a 'quiet room' after a client starts screaming",
                "Scheduling 'heavy work' activities every 90 minutes regardless of current behavior",
                "Providing a sensory break only when the client asks for one"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proactive strategies are scheduled and implemented while the client is still in their 'Window of Tolerance' to maintain homeostasis and prevent dysregulation."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client who experiences 'motion sickness' easily or is fearful of their feet leaving the ground likely has a hyper-sensitivity in which system?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The vestibular system manages balance and spatial orientation; hyper-sensitivity (avoiding) often manifests as gravitational insecurity or motion sensitivity."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "What is the 'Interoceptive Awareness' foundation often referred to as in neurodiversity-affirming practice?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is considered the foundation of self-awareness because it is the brain's process of receiving and interpreting signals from the internal organs and body."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When a client is in a 'Dorsal Vagal' state (shutdown/immobilization), which type of sensory input is generally most appropriate to begin the 'climb' back to regulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Moving out of a shutdown state requires gentle, safe, and predictable input that signals safety to the nervous system without triggering a sympathetic 'fight/flight' response."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "The concept of 'Resonance' in Lesson 8 relies heavily on which neurological mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow us to 'resonate' with the internal state of others, forming the biological basis for empathy and emotional safety."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which sensory input is unique because it is almost universally 'organizing' and rarely over-stimulating, making it a 'go-to' tool for Specialists?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input (heavy work/deep pressure) is unique in its ability to be both calming for the over-stimulated and alerting for the under-stimulated, making it highly organizing for the nervous system."
