            "question": "When conducting Advanced Baseline Profiling (L1), why is it critical to identify 'internalized' neuro-profiles in high-masking individuals?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure they are placed in high-support special education classrooms immediately",
                "To prevent the 'clinical oversight' where high cognitive ability masks significant executive dysfunction and sensory exhaustion",
                "To determine if they qualify for a secondary diagnosis of Oppositional Defiant Disorder",
                "To encourage the individual to mask more effectively in social situations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-masking individuals often present as 'fine' while experiencing significant internal distress; profiling must look beyond surface-level compliance to identify executive and sensory needs."

            "question": "According to the neurobiology of Autistic Burnout (L2), what is a primary physiological differentiator between burnout and clinical depression?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is characterized by a permanent loss of IQ points",
                "Depression involves a lack of interest, whereas burnout involves a loss of functional skills and increased sensory sensitivity despite a desire to engage",
                "Burnout is caused solely by lack of sleep, while depression is genetic",
                "There is no physiological difference; they are the same condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic burnout specifically involves a 'loss of skills' (regression) and heightened sensory reactivity, often driven by chronic over-taxation of the nervous system rather than primary anhedonia."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the context of Multi-Modal Communication (L3), how should a specialist view 'delayed echolalia' (gestalt language processing)?",
            "options": [
                "As a non-functional behavior that should be ignored to encourage 'real' speech",
                "As a sign of cognitive decline that requires medical intervention",
                "As a legitimate, meaningful form of communication where scripts carry specific intent or emotional weight",
                "As a symptom of poor parenting and lack of exposure to language"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt language processors use 'chunks' or scripts (echolalia) to communicate complex meanings; specialists must validate these as functional communication while helping the client break them down."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Sensory Gating' in environmental design. What is the primary goal of reducing 'visual noise' in a workspace?",
            "options": [
                "To make the room look more aesthetically pleasing for visitors",
                "To save money on decorations and furniture",
                "To reduce the cognitive load required to filter out irrelevant stimuli, preserving energy for the actual task",
                "To ensure the individual does not get distracted by bright colors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent brains often have 'leaky' sensory gating; reducing visual noise minimizes the metabolic energy spent on 'filtering,' which prevents premature cognitive fatigue."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "A growth-oriented goal focused on 'Autonomy' rather than 'Compliance' (L5) would look like:",
            "options": [
                "The client will maintain eye contact for 5 seconds during 80% of trials",
                "The client will use a designated 'quiet space' when they identify their own sensory overwhelm",
                "The client will stop stimming when told 'hands quiet'",
                "The client will follow 100% of teacher instructions without questioning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autonomy-based goals focus on self-regulation and self-advocacy (internal cues), whereas compliance-based goals focus on performing for the comfort of others (external cues)."

                "Parents must agree to all school recommendations to maintain federal funding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LRE is a legal principle under IDEA stating that students should only be removed from general education settings when the nature of their disability prevents successful education even with supplementary aids."

                "Redirect; to move the client to a different activity immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "De-escalation is a 'co-regulation' process; the specialist must first regulate their own nervous system to provide a 'calm anchor' for the client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialists support, advocate, and implement strategies, but formal diagnosis is a clinical act reserved for licensed medical or psychological professionals (MDs, PhDs, PsyDs)."

            "question": "A client is experiencing 'Shutdown' (L2/L7). They are non-responsive, staring at the floor, and breathing shallowly. What is the most appropriate B.R.I.D.G.E. response?",
            "options": [
                "Ask them multiple questions to get them talking",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shutdown is an immobilization response; increasing demands or sensory input will worsen the state. Low-demand presence allows the nervous system to return to a state of safety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing the physical and cognitive distance between a need and its solution (the 'cost of effort') is a key strategy in reducing cognitive load."
