            "question": "What is the fundamental shift in 'Neuro-Affirming Environmental Design' compared to traditional behavioral environments?",
            "options": [
                "Prioritizing aesthetic appeal and modern architecture over functionality",
                "Moving from environments that demand compliance to environments that support autonomy and sensory regulation",
                "Standardizing all spaces to ensure every neurodivergent person has the exact same experience",
                "Focusing exclusively on physical safety and the elimination of all potential hazards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming design shifts the focus from 'fixing' the individual to 'fixing' the environment, prioritizing the user's autonomy and sensory needs over behavioral compliance."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Which acoustic phenomenon is most likely to cause 'sensory friction' for a neurodivergent individual in a large, open-plan office?",
            "options": [
                "Low ambient white noise",
                "High reverberation time caused by hard surfaces",

                "Strategic placement of soft furniture and partitions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High reverberation time (echo) caused by hard surfaces creates a 'wall of sound' that makes it difficult for neurodivergent individuals to filter out background noise from meaningful speech."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), how do visual supports like 'First/Then' boards reduce cognitive strain?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the 'Germane Load' through complex visual processing",
                "By offloading 'Working Memory' requirements to the external environment",
                "By forcing the individual to memorize the entire daily schedule at once",
                "By eliminating the need for any transitions during the day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visual supports act as an external 'hard drive' for the brain, reducing the working memory load required to track sequences and expectations."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In the design of 'Regulation Zones,' what is the primary difference between a 'Sensory Room' and a 'Decompression Space'?",
            "options": [
                "Sensory rooms are for punishment; decompression spaces are for rewards",
                "Sensory rooms provide controlled stimulation (input); decompression spaces provide low-arousal recovery (rest)",
                "There is no functional difference; they are different names for the same thing",
                "Decompression spaces are only for adults, while sensory rooms are only for children"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory rooms are often designed for active sensory modulation or integration, while decompression spaces are specifically designed to minimize all input for recovery from overload."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "When structuring a 'Social Environment' using the Double Empathy Problem framework, what should be the designer's goal?",
            "options": [
                "To train neurodivergent individuals to maintain eye contact at all times",
                "To create spaces that facilitate 'Parallel Play' and multiple modes of communication",
                "To ensure neurotypical social norms are the only ones permitted in the space",
                "To eliminate all social interaction opportunities to prevent conflict"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Designing for Double Empathy means acknowledging that communication is a two-way street; environments should support diverse social styles, including parallel play and non-verbal interaction."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 6 indicates that 'Hot-desking' (unassigned seating) can be particularly challenging for neurodivergent employees. Why?",
            "options": [
                "Because neurodivergent people prefer to sit near the exits",
                "Because it removes environmental predictability and increases the 'Executive Function' load of daily setup",
                "Because it encourages too much social interaction with coworkers",
                "Because it is usually more expensive for the company to implement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hot-desking creates daily uncertainty and requires significant executive function to find and set up a new workspace, which can lead to early-morning cognitive fatigue."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which 'Digital Environment' design choice adheres to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for neurodivergent users?",
            "options": [
                "Using auto-playing videos to capture immediate attention",
                "Providing clear, consistent navigation and the ability to disable animations",
                "Using a high-contrast, 'neon' color palette to increase visibility",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency and the ability to control sensory input (like animations) are key digital accessibility features for neurodivergent users."

            "options": [
                "The blueprint provided by the architect",
                "The subjective 'lived experience' and sensory feedback of the actual user",
                "The budget constraints of the facility management",
                "A one-time observation by an outside consultant during off-hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The user's lived experience is the 'gold standard' for an audit, as sensory perception is highly individualized and cannot be fully captured by external observation alone."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis suggested that approximately what percentage of autistic individuals experience atypical sensory processing?",

                "Approximately 25%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Over 90%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that sensory processing differences are nearly universal in the autistic population, with rates typically cited above 90%."

                "Requiring the student to wear sunglasses during all lessons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing 'Extraneous Load' by decluttering the visual field (Visual Diet) allows the student to focus on the primary instructional material without sensory distraction."
