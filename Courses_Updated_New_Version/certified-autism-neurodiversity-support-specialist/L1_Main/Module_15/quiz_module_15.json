            "question": "According to 'Prospect and Refuge' theory in neuro-inclusive architecture (L1), which spatial configuration is most likely to reduce cortisol levels and anxiety for neurodivergent individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Open-plan layouts with 360-degree visibility and no partitions.",
                "Small, windowless rooms located in the center of a building.",
                "Seating areas that provide a protected back ('refuge') with a clear view of the surrounding space ('prospect').",
                "High-ceiling environments with industrial-style exposed piping and bright white surfaces."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prospect and Refuge theory suggests that humans feel safest when they have a secure place to sit (refuge) while being able to scan their environment for potential threats or changes (prospect)."

            "question": "During a professional Sensory Audit (L2), why is it critical to measure 'flicker rate' in LED or fluorescent lighting?",
            "options": [
                "Because it significantly reduces the lifespan of the bulb.",
                "Because neurodivergent individuals often have a higher 'Critical Flicker Fusion' threshold, perceiving stroboscopic effects that cause headaches and sensory overload.",
                "Because flicker rates interfere with high-speed internet connections in digital environments.",
                "Because flicker rates are the primary cause of poor color rendering in retail spaces."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many neurodivergent individuals process visual information faster or more intensely; what looks like a steady light to a neurotypical person may appear as a distressing strobe light to someone with sensory processing differences."

            "options": [
                "It states that cognitive load increases logarithmically with the number of choices, suggesting that navigation should be simplified to prevent executive function burnout.",
                "It requires that all digital text be written at a 5th-grade reading level.",
                "It mandates the use of high-contrast yellow text on black backgrounds for all users.",
                "It suggests that video content should never exceed 60 seconds in length."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hick's Law describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices: increasing choices increases cognitive load, which can lead to 'choice paralysis' for those with executive dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Body doubling involves working alongside another person (virtually or in person) to improve focus and accountability, which is a highly effective systemic support for task initiation."

            "options": [
                "Accommodations are more expensive than Universal Design.",
                "Accommodations are reactive and student-specific, while Universal Design is proactive and benefits the entire student body.",
                "Universal Design is only used for physical disabilities like wheelchair access.",
                "Accommodations are legally required, while Universal Design is always optional."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tier L1 focuses on Universal Design (UDL), which modifies the environment for everyone (e.g., providing quiet zones for all students) rather than waiting for a student to fail before providing a specific accommodation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem, proposed by Damian Milton, suggests that social difficulties are a two-way street resulting from different communication styles and life experiences between neurodivergent and neurotypical people."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low Arousal environments reduce the total sensory load, allowing an individual's nervous system to de-escalate before a sensory 'meltdown' occurs."

                "They provide a structured environment where social rules are always strictly enforced.",
