            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The BRIDGE framework starts with Baseline Profiling to understand the individual's unique neuro-biological and sensory starting point before planning interventions."

            "question": "When profiling a client with co-occurring Autism and ADHD (AuDHD), which dynamic is most commonly observed regarding their executive function?",
            "options": [
                "The ADHD traits completely mask the Autistic need for routine",
                "A 'tug-of-war' between a need for sameness/predictability and a craving for novelty/stimulation",
                "The individual experiences no sensory processing issues because the conditions cancel each other out",
                "Hyper-focus is impossible in AuDHD individuals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AuDHD individuals often experience a paradoxical internal conflict where their autistic side requires structure while their ADHD side seeks constant change."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the body's most primitive defense mechanism, resulting in shutdown or dissociation when the system perceives a life-threatening level of overwhelm."

            "options": [
                "A deficit in the neurodivergent person's ability to feel empathy",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that communication issues are a two-way street caused by different lived experiences and processing styles, not a one-sided deficit."

                "Focusing exclusively on physical access, such as ramps and elevators",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "UDNI aims to design environments that accommodate the widest range of neurobiological needs from the outset, reducing the need for individual 'special' accommodations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dignity of Risk acknowledges that overprotecting neurodivergent individuals prevents them from developing resilience and self-determination; risk-taking is a fundamental human right."

                "A policy that excludes neurotypical professionals from advocacy",
                "The requirement that neurodivergent individuals must be lead stakeholders in any policy changes affecting them",
                "A rule that advocacy must only happen in private settings",
                "A funding model for neurodiversity non-profits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This principle ensures that the people directly impacted by systemic changes (neurodivergent individuals) are the ones driving the decision-making process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires Specialists to recognize signs of compassion fatigue or burnout and seek supervision to ensure their personal state does not negatively impact client care."

            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Exactly 50%",

                "Ask the client to stop so they appear more professional to the board",
                "Explain to the board that the stimming is a self-regulation tool that helps the client focus and process information",
                "Suggest the client leaves the room until they can sit still",
                "Ignore it and hope no one notices the behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming advocacy involves educating others that stimming is often a functional tool for nervous system regulation, not a 'behavior' that needs to be suppressed."
