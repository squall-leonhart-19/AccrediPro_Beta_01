            "question": "In the BRIDGE Framework™, what does the 'B' stand for, and what is its primary purpose in the neuro-affirming process?",
            "options": [
                "Behavioral Modification; to eliminate non-functional repetitive movements.",
                "Baseline Profile; to map a person's unique neuro-signature including sensory, communication, and cognitive styles.",
                "Boundary Setting; to establish strict rules for client-practitioner interaction.",
                "Biomedical Assessment; to identify underlying nutritional deficiencies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'B' stands for Baseline Profile. In a neuro-affirming shift, we move away from behavioral modification and toward decoding the individual's unique 'neuro-signature' to understand how they process the world."

            "question": "According to the 'Double Empathy Problem' (Milton, 2012) discussed in Lesson 4, communication breakdowns between neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals are primarily caused by:",
            "options": [
                "A social communication deficit inherent to the autistic brain.",
                "A lack of theory of mind in neurodivergent individuals.",
                "A mutual mismatch in communication styles and lived experiences between two different neurotypes.",
                "The neurotypical individual's inability to use visual supports."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication is a two-way street; difficulties arise because both parties have different ways of experiencing and expressing empathy and social cues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the foundation of physiological safety, allowing for social engagement, connection, and the 'resonance' required for neuro-affirming support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Visual (flicker), olfactory (smells), and proprioceptive (body position) inputs are all significant sensory demands that can accumulate and lead to sensory overload or 'meltdown' if not managed."

            "id": "q8_5",

                "By focusing on reducing the frequency of 'stimming' behaviors.",
                "By prioritizing goals that increase the client's ability to mask their traits in public.",
                "By focusing on Autonomy and Quality of Life (QoL) as defined by the neurodivergent individual.",
                "By following standardized developmental milestones regardless of the individual's neuro-signature."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming goals prioritize the individual's autonomy and their own definition of a 'good life' rather than forcing compliance with neurotypical social norms."

                "Implement a reward system where Leo earns tokens for quiet transitions.",
                "Consult the Baseline Profile to see if the distress is caused by sensory shifts or a need for cognitive predictability.",
                "Require Leo to stay in the transition until he can 'calm his body' independently.",
                "Ignore the distress to avoid reinforcing the behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The BRIDGE Framework starts with the Baseline Profile. We must first decode the 'why' (sensory, cognitive, or safety-based) before intervening, rather than just treating the outward behavior."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic inclusion shifts the burden of change from the individual to the environment, focusing on removing barriers and creating accessible spaces for all neurotypes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ethical neuro-affirming practice emphasizes 'Assent'—the ongoing willingness of the individual to participate—recognizing their agency and autonomy regardless of their legal status."

                "Increased risk of vulnerability to abuse due to learned passivity.",
                "Higher rates of burnout and mental health challenges from chronic masking.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Compliance-based approaches often teach individuals to ignore their own needs and boundaries to please others, which can lead to significant long-term psychological harm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resonance is about emotional and physiological attunement. It involves validating the client's experience and meeting them where they are, which is essential for a neuro-affirming therapeutic alliance."
