            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The growth-oriented paradigm moves away from 'fixing' the person and instead focuses on leveraging strengths and enhancing the individual's subjective Quality of Life (QoL)."

                "It is only relevant for high-functioning individuals who do not require support.",
                "It involves the opportunity to make choices, exercise personal control, and pursue personal goals.",
                "It is measured primarily by how well an individual follows a pre-set clinical protocol.",
                "It is a secondary domain that should only be addressed after social skills are mastered."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-determination is a core pillar of Quality of Life, emphasizing that all individuals, regardless of support needs, should have agency over their choices and life direction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SDT focuses on Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness. Compliance is often the antithesis of autonomy and is not considered a basic psychological need for growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Monotropism suggests that autistic individuals often have a powerful, narrow focus. Neuro-affirming goals leverage this focus (flow states) rather than fighting against it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In neuro-affirming practice, the individual's internal experience (subjective well-being) is a more valid measure of success than external behavioral compliance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding is a developmental tool that provides enough support to allow the individual to succeed in their 'zone of proximal development' until they can perform the task independently."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This goal leverages Leo's monotropic interest (meteorology) to facilitate 'Relatedness' in a way that feels safe and authentic, rather than forcing neurotypical social scripts."
