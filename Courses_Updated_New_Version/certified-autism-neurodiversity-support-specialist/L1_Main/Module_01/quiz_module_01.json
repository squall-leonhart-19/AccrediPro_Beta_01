            "question": "What is the primary philosophical shift in creating a 'Baseline Profile' compared to traditional deficit-based assessments?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses on identifying a permanent clinical diagnosis.",
                "It views the individual's current functioning as a dynamic starting point rather than a fixed set of limitations.",
                "It prioritizes comparing the individual to neurotypical developmental milestones.",
                "It is designed to determine if a person qualifies for medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Baseline Profile is neurodiversity-affirming because it treats the individual's current state as a dynamic 'roadmap' for support, focusing on their unique profile rather than measuring them against a 'normal' standard or fixed deficits."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client frequently trips over their own feet, uses excessive force when closing doors, and seeks out 'heavy work' like carrying weighted backpacks. Which sensory system is likely under-responsive (hypo-sensitive)?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular",
                "Interoceptive",
                "Proprioceptive",
                "Olfactory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioception is the sense of self-movement and body position. Individuals who are under-responsive to proprioceptive input often seek 'heavy work' or deep pressure to better feel where their body is in space."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to the theory of Monotropism, why might an autistic individual struggle with sudden transitions between tasks?",
            "options": [
                "Because their attention is concentrated in 'interest tunnels' that require significant cognitive energy to shift.",
                "Because they lack the intellectual capacity to understand the new task.",
                "Because they are intentionally being defiant or non-compliant.",
                "Because they have a generalized deficit in all forms of long-term memory."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Monotropism suggests that autistic attention tends to be pulled into a few highly aroused 'interest tunnels.' Shifting out of these tunnels is cognitively taxing and can cause significant distress if forced abruptly."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Dr. Damian Milton's 'Double Empathy Problem' suggests that communication breakdowns between neurodivergent and neurotypical people are caused by:",
            "options": [
                "A biological inability of autistic people to feel empathy.",
                "The neurotypical person's superior social skills being too complex.",
                "A lack of effort on the part of the neurodivergent individual.",
                "A mutual mismatch in communication styles, social cues, and experiences between two different neurotypes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties are a two-way street; neurotypical people often have just as much trouble understanding neurodivergent perspectives as vice versa."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In the context of strengths and interests, a 'Flow State' is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Increased anxiety and a need for external validation.",
                "Deep immersion in an activity where the sense of time and self-consciousness diminishes.",
                "The ability to multitask effectively across four or more unrelated topics.",
                "A state of high distractibility and low motivation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flow states, often reached through Special Interests (SpIns), are periods of deep focus and enjoyment where the individual is fully absorbed in the task, which can be highly regulating for the nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes an emotional 'shutdown'?",
            "options": [
                "An externalizing, explosive release of energy due to sensory overload.",
                "A manipulative tactic used to avoid doing chores or schoolwork.",
                "An internalizing response where the individual may become non-speaking, withdraw, or appear 'spaced out' as a survival mechanism.",
                "A cognitive refusal to learn new executive functioning skills."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A shutdown is an involuntary 'freeze' or 'faint' response to overwhelming stress or sensory input, where the nervous system conserves energy by withdrawing inward."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "When collecting data for a Baseline Profile, why is 'Ecological Validity' important?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures that observations reflect how the person actually functions in their real-world environments (home, school, work).",
                "It ensures the data is strictly collected in a controlled laboratory setting.",
                "It prioritizes the use of standardized IQ tests over personal narratives.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the environmental impact on climate change."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ecological validity means the assessment findings are relevant to the person's real life. Functioning can vary wildly between a quiet clinic and a loud, busy classroom."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In the Baseline Roadmap, why is it essential to prioritize 'Sensory Safety' before attempting to teach new social or academic skills?",
            "options": [
                "Because sensory safety is the easiest goal to achieve.",
                "Because a nervous system in a state of 'threat' or dysregulation cannot access the prefrontal cortex for higher-level learning.",
                "Because social skills are not considered important in neurodiversity-affirming care.",
                "Because academic skills should only be taught after the age of 10."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological safety is the foundation of the 'learning brain.' If a client is in sensory distress, their body is in 'survival mode,' making it neurologically impossible to effectively process new information or skills."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client struggles with 'Working Memory.' How might this manifest during a coaching session?",
            "options": [
                "The client is unable to feel physical pain.",
                "The client has an excellent memory for facts about their special interest.",
                "The client is able to plan complex projects months in advance.",
                "The client loses track of a multi-step instruction given only moments before."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Working memory is the ability to hold and manipulate information in the mind over short periods. Struggles here often lead to difficulty following multi-step verbal directions."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which term describes the internal sensory system that allows us to feel hunger, thirst, and heart rate, often impacting emotional regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular sense",
                "Tactile perception",
                "Interoception",
                "Auditory processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the 'eighth sense' that provides information about the internal state of the body. Poor interoceptive awareness can make it difficult for a person to realize they are stressed or hungry until they are in a state of meltdown."
