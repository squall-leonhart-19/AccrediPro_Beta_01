            "options": [
                "Evaluation; it focuses on standardized testing scores.",
                "Environment; it focuses on modifying the physical and sensory surroundings to reduce cognitive load.",
                "Enforcement; it ensures compliance with classroom rules.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the BRIDGE framework, 'Environment' involves modifying settings to align with the child's sensory and processing needs, which is essential for successful transitions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that communication breakdowns occur because both parties (neurodivergent and neurotypical) struggle to understand each other's experiences."
