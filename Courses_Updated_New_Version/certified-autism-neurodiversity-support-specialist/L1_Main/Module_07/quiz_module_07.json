            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming advocacy rejects the medical model's focus on 'fixing' the individual and instead focuses on the social model, which emphasizes autonomy, self-determination, and modifying environments to fit the person."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
