            "question": "The shift from the 'Pathology Paradigm' to the 'Neurodiversity Paradigm' in research is best characterized by which of the following changes?",
            "options": [
                "A shift from searching for a 'cure' to focusing on support, inclusion, and quality of life.",
                "An increase in the use of high-dose behavioral interventions to normalize social cues.",
                "A focus on identifying the specific genetic markers that cause autism in order to prevent it.",
                "The exclusive use of quantitative data over qualitative lived-experience reports."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Neurodiversity Paradigm views autism as a natural variation of the human genome and shifts the research focus from 'fixing' the individual to improving support systems and societal inclusion."

            "question": "In the 'Three Pillars' of Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) for neuro-affirming coaching, which pillar is specifically emphasized to prevent the 'Double Empathy Problem'?",
            "options": [
                "The coach's clinical expertise and past certifications.",
                "The use of standardized behavioral assessments only.",
                "The client’s lived experience, preferences, and self-reported goals.",
                "Peer-reviewed meta-analyses that focus on compliance-based outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming EBP prioritizes the client's lived experience and autonomy to ensure interventions are relevant and respectful of their neurotype, directly addressing the communication gap known as the Double Empathy Problem."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Research into the neuro-biological foundations of sensory regulation indicates that many neurodivergent individuals experience 'Sensory Over-Responsivity' due to:",
            "options": [
                "A lack of discipline and poor self-regulation training.",
                "Increased amygdala activation and decreased habituation to repetitive stimuli.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurological studies show that sensory over-responsivity is linked to heightened amygdala responses and a biological inability to 'filter out' or habituate to repetitive sensory input."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "According to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) discussed in Lesson 6, why do 'open-plan' environments often lead to cognitive exhaustion for Autistic individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Because they provide too much space for movement.",
                "Because they lack sufficient social interaction opportunities.",
                "Because the 'extraneous load' of processing background noise and visual movement depletes working memory resources.",
                "Because neurodivergent individuals lack the 'intrinsic load' required to complete complex tasks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open-plan environments increase extraneous cognitive load—sensory information that does not contribute to the task—which consumes the limited working memory capacity of the individual."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that interventions focused strictly on behavioral compliance can lead to 'masking,' which is strongly correlated with burnout, anxiety, and depression in neurodivergent adults."

            "id": "q19_6",

            "options": [
                "High levels of creativity and 'out of the box' thinking.",
                "A lack of professionalism or 'defiance,' rather than a biological difficulty in suppressing impulses.",
                "Superior attention to detail and data analysis skills.",
                "An innate preference for chaotic work environments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The research emphasizes that what looks like defiance is often a breakdown in inhibitory control, a core component of executive functioning that makes it difficult to stop an immediate response."

                "To increase the number of participants in a clinical drug trial.",
                "To study neurodivergent people from a distance to maintain 'scientific objectivity.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Participatory research follows the 'Nothing About Us Without Us' principle, ensuring the community being studied has a voice in the questions asked and the methods used."

                "The client’s self-reported increase in 'Agency' and 'Internal Locus of Control.'",
                "The reduction of all repetitive behaviors to zero."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming outcomes focus on the individual’s quality of life, autonomy, and agency, rather than their ability to mimic neurotypical behaviors."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the 'Insular Cortex' (Insula). What role does research suggest this brain region plays in neurodivergent experiences?",
            "options": [
                "It is solely responsible for motor coordination and balance.",
                "It is involved in 'interoception,' the internal sense of the body's condition, which is often atypical in autism.",
                "It controls the ability to perform complex mathematical calculations.",
                "It has no known function in sensory processing or emotional regulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The insula is critical for interoception (sensing internal states like hunger or heart rate). Research shows that atypical interoception is a common feature of neurodivergence, impacting emotional regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By removing a sensory stressor (the buzzing light), the coach reduces the extraneous cognitive load the client must process, allowing them to allocate more energy to their actual work."
