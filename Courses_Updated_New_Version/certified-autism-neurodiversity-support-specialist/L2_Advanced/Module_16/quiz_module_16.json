            "question": "When profiling a client with the AuDHD (Autism + ADHD) phenotype and a PDA (Pervasive Drive for Autonomy) profile, which communication style is most effective for reducing demand avoidance?",
            "options": [
                "Direct, instructional language with clear deadlines",
                "Declarative language that offers choice and collaboration",
                "Token economy systems with immediate rewards",
                "Strict behavioral charting and routine adherence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For PDA profiles, direct demands trigger the nervous system's threat response. Declarative language (e.g., 'I wonder if...') reduces the perceived threat to autonomy while ADHD-friendly novelty maintains engagement."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the 'Regulate & Resonate' crisis intervention model, what is the primary goal of the 'Regulate' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To discuss the triggers that led to the crisis",
                "To establish consequences for the behavior shown",
                "To utilize co-regulation to stabilize the client's nervous system",
                "To teach new coping strategies while the client is high-arousal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Regulate' phase focuses exclusively on safety and nervous system stabilization through co-regulation. Cognitive processing or 'teaching moments' cannot occur until the client has moved out of a fight-flight-freeze state."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "When supporting non-speaking adults using AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication), which principle represents the 'Least Dangerous Assumption'?",
            "options": [
                "Assuming the client has a cognitive impairment until proven otherwise",
                "Assuming the client understands everything said to them (Presuming Competence)",
                "Limiting AAC options to basic needs (food/bathroom) to avoid overwhelm",
                "Focusing solely on verbal approximations before introducing high-tech AAC"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Presuming competence is the 'least dangerous assumption' because the consequences of underestimating a non-speaking individual's intelligence are far more damaging than the consequences of overestimating it."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "During a corporate workplace audit, which environmental factor is frequently identified as a 'hidden' sensory trigger for neurodivergent employees?",
            "options": [
                "The color of the office carpeting",
                "The height of the office chairs",
                "High-frequency 'coil whine' from electronics and HVAC systems",
                "The presence of plants in common areas"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Auditory processing sensitivities often mean neurodivergent individuals can hear high-frequency sounds from electronics or HVAC systems that are 'tuned out' by neurotypical peers, leading to significant sensory fatigue."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In the transition to Higher Education (Lesson 5), what is the most significant legal shift for an autistic student moving from high school to university?",
            "options": [
                "The student no longer has access to any accommodations",
                "The burden of disclosure shifts from the school to the student",
                "Parents retain the right to manage the student's academic records",
                "The university is required to provide the same IEP services as the high school"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) in higher education, the student must self-identify and request accommodations, whereas in K-12 (under IDEA), the school is responsible for identification and evaluation."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "The BRIDGE framework for healthcare advocacy emphasizes 'Empowered Advocacy.' Which action best demonstrates this principle in a medical setting?",
            "options": [
                "Allowing the doctor to make all decisions without interruption",
                "Using a 'Healthcare Passport' to communicate sensory needs and pain scales",
                "Avoiding medical appointments until a crisis occurs",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Healthcare Passport is a tool for empowered advocacy that proactively communicates an individual's specific neurodivergent needs, communication style, and sensory sensitivities to medical staff."

            "id": "q16_7",

            "options": [
                "Burnout involves a loss of skills and reduced sensory tolerance, whereas depression is primarily mood-based",
                "Burnout is cured by a short vacation, while depression is permanent",
                "There is no clinical difference; they are the same condition",
                "Burnout only affects children, while depression only affects adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Autistic burnout is characterized by chronic exhaustion, loss of functional skills (regression), and increased sensory sensitivity, which are distinct from the primary symptoms of clinical depression."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When applying the BRIDGE model to intersectionality (Lesson 8), why must a specialist consider 'Cultural Responsiveness'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the specialist's own culture is prioritized",
                "Because neurodivergence is expressed and perceived differently across different cultural and ethnic backgrounds",
                "To discourage the use of native languages in therapy",
                "Because ADHD does not exist in non-Western cultures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural responsiveness acknowledges that the intersection of neurodivergence with race, ethnicity, and culture influences how symptoms are masked, how families seek support, and how the individual experiences the world."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "In a workplace audit, 'Acoustic Flicker' refers to which phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "The blinking of fluorescent lights",
                "The rapid change in volume of background office chatter",
                "The visual sensation of sound waves",
                "The rhythmic humming of machinery that causes sensory 'stuttering'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acoustic flicker refers to the inconsistent, unpredictable noise levels (like sudden laughter or a ringing phone) in open-plan offices that prevent a neurodivergent brain from filtering out background noise."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A client in burnout recovery is ready for 'Phase 2: Re-integration.' What is the recommended approach for returning to work or school?",
            "options": [
                "A full-time return to ensure the client 'gets back into the swing of things'",
                "A gradual, low-demand re-entry with significant sensory modifications",
                "Changing careers entirely to avoid any previous triggers",
                "Waiting until the client is 100% symptom-free before any re-integration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burnout recovery requires a paced approach. Pushing for a full-time return too quickly often triggers a relapse. Gradual re-entry allows the nervous system to adapt while maintaining the 'Safety First' protocol."
