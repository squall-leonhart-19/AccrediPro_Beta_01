            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the process of weaving together the Biological, Relational, Individual, Developmental, Global, and Environmental data into a unified support plan that addresses the whole person."

                "The correlation between Body mass index and Recovery rates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The B-R Interdependency looks at how a client's biological reality (like sensory processing) influences their relationships, and how those relationships in turn impact their biological regulation."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "When synthesizing support for 'AuDHD' (Autism + ADHD) neurotypes, which 'paradox' is a specialist most likely to address?",

                "The preference for visual learning vs. the preference for auditory learning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AuDHD individuals often experience a conflict between the ADHD need for novelty/dopamine-seeking and the Autistic need for sameness and structure, requiring a synthesized approach to scheduling."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental design for transitions emphasizes creating 'sensory-neutral zones' where the individual can regulate their nervous system, allowing for better executive functioning during complex life changes."

                "The client will follow a neurotypical social script during job interviews."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming goals focus on agency and self-regulation (using a toolkit) rather than suppressing natural movements (stimming) or mimicking neurotypical social behaviors (eye contact)."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "According to the Ethics and Professionalism lesson, what is 'Epistemic Humility' in the context of neuro-affirming synthesis?",

                "Strictly following clinical manuals regardless of client feedback"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epistemic humility involves recognizing that the specialist cannot 'know' the client's internal state better than the client themselves, prioritizing the client's self-report."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internalized metrics focus on the individual's internal state, such as their sense of safety, autonomy, and self-acceptance, rather than just observable outward behaviors."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "The 'Integrated Neuro-Affirming Support Plan' (The Capstone) includes a 'Dynamic Adjustment Protocol.' What is its purpose?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a rigid schedule that never changes",

                "To automate the reporting process for insurance companies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dynamic Adjustment Protocols recognize that neurodivergent needs fluctuate (e.g., 'spoon theory' or sensory load), and the support plan must be flexible enough to accommodate these changes."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "When synthesizing support for co-occurring Autism and Anxiety, the 'Relational' (R) component should prioritize:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For neurodivergent individuals, safety is the foundation of regulation. Prioritizing co-regulation and psychological safety helps manage the anxiety often inherent in a neurotypical world."

            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Marcus' (Lesson 2), which synthesized intervention led to the greatest reduction in 'behavioral outbursts' at school?",
