            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Neuro-Profiling,' how does a neuro-affirming profile differ from a traditional medical model diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses exclusively on the DSM-5 criteria for deficit identification.",
                "It prioritizes the internal experience and support needs over observable behavioral deficits.",
                "It relies solely on standardized IQ testing to determine support eligibility.",
                "It aims to eliminate neurodivergent traits through targeted behavioral interventions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-profiling moves beyond diagnostic labels to map an individual's unique cognitive, sensory, and emotional landscape, focusing on how they experience the world rather than just how their behavior affects others."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "When using standardized tools like the RAADS-R or CAT-Q, what is a critical consideration for the practitioner regarding 'Masking'?",
            "options": [
                "Masking makes standardized scores more accurate by reflecting social competence.",
                "High masking scores often correlate with lower internal distress.",
                "Standardized tools may under-identify neurodivergence in individuals with high compensation scores.",
                "Masking is only relevant in pediatric assessments and does not affect adult scoring."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) highlights that individuals who 'mask' or compensate for their traits may not meet traditional thresholds on other standardized tools despite significant internal struggle."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'alexithymia' and struggles to recognize hunger or the need to use the restroom. Which assessment area should be prioritized?",
            "options": [
                "Auditory Processing Mapping",
                "Interoceptive Awareness Inventory",

                "Proprioceptive Feedback Loop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the 'eighth sense' that allows us to feel internal bodily states. Deficits in interoceptive awareness are common in neurodivergence and directly link to challenges in emotional regulation and self-care."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Double Empathy Problem' (Milton, 2012), how should social communication assessments be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "As a measure of the neurodivergent person's inherent social deficit.",
                "As a measure of the neurodivergent person's lack of Theory of Mind.",
                "As a reflection of a bidirectional breakdown in understanding between different neurotypes.",
                "As a tool to identify which social skills the client needs to mimic to appear neurotypical."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication breakdowns occur because of differing communication styles between neurotypes, not because one type is 'broken' or 'deficient.'"

            "options": [
                "The total amount of information the working memory can hold at one time.",
                "The physical weight of the brain during intense problem-solving.",
                "The speed at which an individual can complete a standardized IQ test.",
                "The ability to suppress 'stimming' behaviors in a classroom setting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cognitive load relates to the demands placed on working memory. Neurodivergent individuals often face higher 'background' cognitive load due to sensory processing and masking, leaving less room for task execution."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During an assessment of the 'Window of Tolerance,' a client who becomes 'shut down,' numb, or disconnected is likely experiencing:",

                "Hyper-arousal (Fight/Flight)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal occurs when the nervous system becomes overwhelmed and 'shuts down' as a survival mechanism, leading to dissociation, numbness, or lethargy."

            "id": "q20_7",

            "options": [
                "To ensure the individual is working hard enough to justify their salary.",
                "To identify 'friction points' where the environment clashes with the individual's neurobiology.",
                "To determine if the individual should be moved to a segregated environment.",
                "To document every time the individual exhibits a non-compliant behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An environmental audit looks at sensory, social, and cognitive demands of a space to remove barriers (friction points) that trigger dysregulation or exhaustion."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "When measuring 'Quality of Life' (QoL) for neurodivergent clients, which metric is considered the most neuro-affirming?",
            "options": [
                "The number of hours the client spends in 'typical' social settings.",
                "The reduction of self-stimulatory behaviors (stimming).",
                "The client's self-reported sense of autonomy and agency in their own life.",
                "The client's ability to maintain eye contact during the assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming outcomes prioritize autonomy and the client's own definition of a good life, rather than how closely they can approximate neurotypical behavior."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent individuals often have 'spiky profiles,' meaning they may perform at a genius level in some areas (e.g., pattern recognition) while requiring significant support in others (e.g., executive function or social processing)."
