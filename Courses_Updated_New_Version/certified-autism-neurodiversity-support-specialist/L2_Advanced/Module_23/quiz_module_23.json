            "options": [
                "The ability to perceive external sensory stimuli like light and sound.",
                "The process of detecting internal bodily signals such as heart rate, hunger, and emotional arousal.",
                "The cognitive ability to plan and execute multi-step tasks.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception involves the brain's process of sensing and interpreting internal physiological signals, which is foundational for emotional regulation and self-awareness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Body doubling is a productivity strategy where the presence of another person helps a neurodivergent individual maintain focus and initiate tasks without direct instruction."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Neuro-affirming cognitive reframing shifts the focus from 'fixing' deficits to 'accommodating' needs. How would a practitioner refit the concept of 'Non-Compliance'?",
            "options": [
                "As a lack of discipline or poor parenting.",
                "As a deliberate attempt to manipulate the environment.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A neuro-affirming lens views behavior as communication, reframing 'non-compliance' as an indication that the environment or task exceeds the individual's current regulatory capacity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' branch of the autonomic nervous system, which is necessary for connection, communication, and cognitive flexibility."

                "Assume the client will never learn to speak verbally.",
                "Assume the client has a profound intellectual disability until proven otherwise.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Least Dangerous Assumption (presuming competence) suggests that it is less harmful to assume a student can learn and fail to teach them, than to assume they cannot learn and never provide the opportunity."

                "When the sensory environment is too dark for an accurate assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when clinicians incorrectly attribute new symptoms (like abdominal pain or depression) to a person's neurodivergence rather than investigating other medical or psychiatric causes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a Dorsal Vagal shutdown, the nervous system perceives a life threat. The priority is to establish physiological safety through gentle, non-threatening cues before attempting any cognitive tasks."
