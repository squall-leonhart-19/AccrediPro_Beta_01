            "question": "In neuro-affirming ethics, what is the primary distinction between the Social Model and the Medical Model regarding intervention goals?",
            "options": [
                "The Medical Model focuses on societal barriers, while the Social Model focuses on curing symptoms.",
                "The Social Model views the environment as the primary site for change, while the Medical Model views the individual as needing 'fixing'.",
                "The Social Model prioritizes compliance, while the Medical Model prioritizes autonomy.",
                "There is no ethical distinction between the two models in modern practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Social Model of Disability posits that disability is a result of the interaction between people and an unaccommodating environment, rather than an inherent 'deficit' in the individual."

            "question": "A coach is working with a non-vocal 10-year-old. The parents have signed the legal consent forms, but the child consistently pushes the coach's hand away and turns their back during sessions. Ethically, what is occurring?",
            "options": [
                "The child is demonstrating 'challenging behavior' that must be ignored to maintain the session.",
                "Consent is legally established, so the coach should proceed with the intervention.",
                "The child is withdrawing assent, and the coach must ethically pause and reassess the approach.",
                "The coach should use a 'first-then' board to ensure the child complies with the consented plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assent is the active, ongoing agreement of the individual. Even if legal consent is provided by a guardian, a neuro-affirming practitioner must respect the withdrawal of assent, which can be signaled through non-vocal cues like avoidance or pushing away."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "Which of the following goals best exemplifies 'Autonomy' rather than 'Paternalism' in a support plan?",
            "options": [
                "The client will maintain eye contact for 5 seconds during 80% of opportunities to improve social perception.",
                "The client will reduce hand-flapping (stimming) in public spaces to avoid social stigma.",
                "The client will identify and use two sensory regulation tools of their choice when feeling overwhelmed.",
                "The client will follow a pre-determined schedule created by the coach to increase productivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autonomy-focused goals empower the individual to make their own choices and manage their own needs, whereas paternalistic goals focus on making the individual appear more 'normal' for the benefit of others."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "During a session, a client’s parent asks the specialist to attend a private family birthday party to 'keep an eye on things' as a friend. Why does this pose an ethical boundary risk?",
            "options": [
                "It creates a dual relationship that could impair professional judgment and blur boundaries.",
                "It is only an issue if the specialist is not paid for their time at the party.",
                "It is acceptable as long as the specialist does not discuss the client's progress with other guests.",
                "Dual relationships are encouraged in neuro-affirming care to build deeper trust."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Professional boundaries prevent 'dual relationships'—situations where a practitioner is in both a professional and a personal/social role with a client—which can lead to conflicts of interest and loss of objectivity."

            "options": [
                "A lack of empathy inherent in the autistic brain.",
                "A mutual breakdown in understanding due to different lived experiences and communication styles.",
                "The neurodivergent individual's inability to read social cues.",
                "The neurotypical individual's superior social processing skills."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication difficulties are a two-way street; both parties lack insight into the other's internal world due to different neurological dispositions."

                "Ensuring the client (if age-appropriate) understands what is being recorded and who has access to it.",
                "Focusing only on the client's deficits to justify the need for high-level support services."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical data management requires transparency and informed participation. Clients should have agency over their own 'narrative' and understand how their sensitive sensory and behavioral data is stored and shared."

            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "A practitioner notices they are feeling a strong need to 'save' a client from their 'unsupportive' family, often overstepping their role to provide extra unpaid hours. This is a red flag for:",

                "Clinical excellence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Savior Complex occurs when a practitioner centers themselves as the 'hero' in the client's life, which undermines the client's (and family's) agency and creates unhealthy dependency."

                "Why neurodiversity is the only factor that matters in behavioral outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality recognizes that a client's experience is shaped by multiple overlapping factors; for example, a Black autistic individual may face different systemic risks (such as police bias) than a white autistic individual."

            "id": "q22_9",

                "They are ethical if they help the child fit in at school.",
                "They are necessary for safety in 100% of cases.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that forced masking and the suppression of self-regulatory behaviors (stimming) are correlated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and 'autistic burnout'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical advocacy requires that the individual being supported remains the primary director of their own life path, ensuring their 'voice' (whether vocal or non-vocal) is the priority."
