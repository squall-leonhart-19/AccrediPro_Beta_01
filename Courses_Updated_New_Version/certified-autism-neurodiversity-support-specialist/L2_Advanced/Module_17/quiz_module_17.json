            "question": "When supporting a client with a Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) profile, which communication style is considered most effective and neuro-affirming?",
            "options": [
                "Direct, firm commands to establish authority",
                "Declarative and collaborative language that preserves the individual's sense of autonomy",
                "Reward-based behavior charts (token economies) to incentivize compliance",
                "Planned ignoring of avoidant behaviors to extinguish the response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PDA is driven by an anxiety-based need for autonomy. Declarative language (e.g., 'I wonder if...') reduces the perception of a demand, whereas direct commands or reward systems often trigger the nervous system's threat response."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic exhaustion, loss of previously mastered skills, and increased sensory sensitivity following a period of intense social 'masking' at work. What is the most likely clinical profile?",
            "options": [
                "Major Depressive Disorder",
                "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
                "Autistic Burnout",
                "Borderline Personality Disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autistic Burnout is characterized by a triad of chronic exhaustion, loss of function (skill regression), and reduced tolerance to sensory stimuli, typically resulting from the cumulative load of masking and navigating inaccessible environments."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In the context of intersectionality, what does the term 'Diagnostic Overshadowing' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "When a person has so many diagnoses that none of them are treated effectively",
                "The tendency for clinicians to attribute all symptoms to a known disability, missing co-occurring conditions",
                "When a primary diagnosis of Autism is 'hidden' by successful masking",
                "The process of a parent receiving a diagnosis after their child is diagnosed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when healthcare providers attribute new or worsening symptoms (like OCD or medical pain) to a client's existing neurodivergence, leading to under-diagnosis or delayed treatment of other conditions."

            "question": "When working with non-speaking or minimally verbal clients, the principle of 'Presuming Competence' requires the practitioner to:",
            "options": [
                "Assume the client understands everything being said and has the capacity to learn, regardless of their current output",
                "Wait until the client masters basic picture exchange (PECS) before introducing complex AAC",
                "Focus exclusively on oral motor exercises to encourage speech production",
                "Assume the client has an intellectual disability until testing proves otherwise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Presuming competence is the 'least dangerous assumption.' It posits that we should assume an individual has the capacity to think and learn, providing them with robust communication tools (AAC) and age-appropriate information."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) in Autistic populations is most frequently driven by which of the following factors?",
            "options": [
                "Distorted body image and a desire for weight loss",
                "Sensory processing differences and fear of aversive consequences (like choking or vomiting)",
                "Intentional defiance and power struggles with caregivers",
                "A lack of interest in social eating rituals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike anorexia or bulimia, ARFID in neurodivergent individuals is typically rooted in sensory sensitivities (texture, smell) or traumatic associations with food, rather than body image concerns."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Which challenge is specifically highlighted for Autistic parents navigating 'Intergenerational Neurodivergence'?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of empathy for their neurodivergent children",
                "Sensory overload caused by the unpredictable noise and touch of child-rearing",
                "An inability to create routines for their children",
                "Resistance to using evidence-based supports"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic parents often face significant sensory challenges, as the constant noise, tactile demands, and unpredictable nature of children can lead to sensory overwhelm and contribute to burnout."

                "Autistic people do not experience age-related health declines",
                "Communication barriers and provider lack of knowledge regarding neuro-specific sensory and routine needs",
                "A biological resistance to pain medication",
                "A preference for clinical environments over home-based care"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic seniors often face systemic barriers, including a lack of medical professionals trained in neuro-affirming care, leading to poor pain management and distress during transitions in care."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "The 'Low Arousal Approach' in neuro-affirming crisis intervention focuses on:",
            "options": [
                "Using loud, assertive commands to regain control of the situation",
                "Reducing the practitioner's own physiological arousal and minimizing demands to de-escalate the client",
                "Immediate use of physical restraints to ensure safety",
                "Demanding the client maintain eye contact to prove they are listening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Low Arousal Approach emphasizes that a practitioner's calm demeanor and the removal of demands can reduce the client's stress levels, preventing further escalation during a crisis."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "In cases of co-occurring OCD and Autism, how do 'compulsions' usually differ from Autistic 'stimming'?",
            "options": [
                "Stimming is always harmful, while compulsions are not",
                "Compulsions are typically driven by distressing intrusive thoughts/anxiety, while stimming is often regulatory or pleasurable",
                "There is no difference; they are the same neurological process",
                "Compulsions only occur in non-speaking individuals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Distinguishing between the two is vital: stimming is usually a self-regulatory or sensory-seeking behavior, whereas OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors performed to neutralize the distress of an obsession."

            "id": "q17_10",

            "options": [
                "Gradual Exposure Therapy to increase social stamina",
                "Increasing the intensity of physical exercise",
                "Significant reduction of 'load,' including sensory withdrawal and removal of non-essential demands",
                "Switching to a more high-pressure environment to 'snap out of it'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary recovery protocol for Autistic Burnout is 'rest and reduction.' This involves minimizing the sensory and cognitive load to allow the nervous system to recover from prolonged over-exertion."
