            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when healthcare professionals attribute new or co-occurring symptoms solely to a pre-existing diagnosis like autism, often missing treatable conditions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universal Design aims to engineer environments that accommodate the widest range of neurodivergent needs by default, reducing the constant need for individual 'special' accommodations."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication is a two-way street; both parties struggle to empathize with the other's different neurological experience."

                "Compliance-based goals are easier to write but harder to track",
                "Autonomy leads to better long-term mental health outcomes and reduces the risk of 'masking' burnout",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compliance-based training often teaches masking, which is linked to high rates of depression and burnout. Autonomy fosters self-advocacy and internal regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
