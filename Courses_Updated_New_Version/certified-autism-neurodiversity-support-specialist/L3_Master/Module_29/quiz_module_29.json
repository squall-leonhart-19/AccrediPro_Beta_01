            "question": "In the context of L1: Transdisciplinary Leadership, what is the primary differentiator of a 'Transdisciplinary' framework compared to an 'Interdisciplinary' one?",
            "options": [
                "Team members work in silos and share reports annually.",
                "Professionals from different fields work together but maintain strict disciplinary boundaries.",
                "Team members transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries to develop a shared conceptual framework and language.",
                "A single lead doctor makes all decisions while other therapists follow instructions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transdisciplinary leadership involves 'blurring' the lines between disciplines to create a unified, holistic approach where the team shares roles and develops a common language for the client's benefit."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "When developing an 'Advanced Baseline Synthesis' (L2), why is it critical to include interoceptive data alongside external behavioral observations?",
            "options": [
                "Because external behaviors are often 'masking' or a secondary reaction to internal physiological states.",
                "Because interoceptive data is easier to measure with standard standardized testing.",
                "Because behavioral observations are no longer considered valid in modern neurodiversity support.",
                "Because insurance companies require interoceptive data for all billing codes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners recognize that behavior is the 'tip of the iceberg.' Understanding the internal physiological state (interoception) is essential to identifying the root cause of the external presentation."

                "A cognitive behavioral technique where the client visualizes an anchor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The practitioner's own nervous system is their most powerful tool. By remaining regulated (ventral vagal), they provide a 'safe' signal that the client's nervous system can mirror through co-regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Low Arousal Approach focuses on de-escalation by reducing triggers, which includes lowering the practitioner's own 'threat' profile through reduced eye contact and verbal demands."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The three pillars of UDL are Representation, Engagement, and Action/Expression. Standardized testing is often a barrier that UDL seeks to address through more flexible assessment methods."

                "Empathy is a learned skill that can only be mastered through intensive compliance-based training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that communication difficulties are a two-way street; neurotypical people often struggle to empathize with neurodivergent perspectives just as much as the reverse."
