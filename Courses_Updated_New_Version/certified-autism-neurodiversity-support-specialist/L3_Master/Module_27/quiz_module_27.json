            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vulnerability Gap refers to the phenomenon where a neurodivergent person may appear articulate (high verbal fluency) but actually fails to comprehend the legal implications of their statements or the rights they are waiving."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Which term describes the clinical error where a healthcare provider attributes a neurodivergent patient's physical symptoms to their developmental disability rather than investigating a new medical cause?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic Overshadowing occurs when clinicians incorrectly attribute physical health symptoms (like abdominal pain) to a person's neurodivergence or 'behavior,' leading to missed diagnoses and medical trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Masking Tax is the significant energy expenditure required to suppress neurodivergent traits to meet social expectations, which often results in severe burnout even in highly successful individuals."

                "No measurable impact on neurodivergent symptom presentation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that the hormonal fluctuations of menopause can intensify executive function challenges and sensory sensitivities, often making previously 'manageable' traits more difficult to navigate."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A neurodivergent athlete who struggles with 'body-in-space' awareness despite high muscular strength is likely experiencing challenges in which sensory system?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adultification bias leads to minority youth being perceived as more mature and less innocent than their peers, resulting in their neurodivergent 'meltdowns' or 'shutdowns' being treated as criminal defiance rather than a need for regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Low Arousal Approach emphasizes reducing environmental triggers, lowering the professional's energy level, and avoiding confrontational body language (like direct eye contact) to allow the nervous system to de-escalate."

                "Because neurodivergent people are unable to work with others",
                "It allows for total control over the sensory environment and the ability to work in alignment with fluctuating energy levels",
                "It is the only way for neurodivergent people to access government grants",
                "It eliminates the need for any executive functioning skills"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrepreneurship, specifically solopreneurship, allows neurodivergent individuals to bypass the 'hidden curriculum' of office politics and design a workspace and schedule that accommodates their specific sensory and cognitive needs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-inclusive healthcare recognizes the 'Double Empathy Problem'—the idea that communication breakdowns occur because of a two-way mismatch in communication styles, requiring providers to adapt their approach."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The compliance reflex (or 'pleasing' response) is a survival strategy where a neurodivergent person may provide the 'correct' or 'expected' answer to an authority figure during high-stress encounters to escape the overwhelming sensory/social pressure."
