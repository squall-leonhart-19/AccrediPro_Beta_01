            "options": [
                "Refinement; it focuses on correcting behavioral deficits.",
                "Regulation; it ensures the nervous system is stable before learning or work begins.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding in a neuro-affirming context means providing supports (like visual schedules or sensory breaks) that respect and utilize the individual's natural processing style."
