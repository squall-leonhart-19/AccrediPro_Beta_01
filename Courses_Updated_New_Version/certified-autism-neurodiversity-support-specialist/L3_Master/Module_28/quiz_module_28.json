            "question": "Which of the following is a primary physiological indicator that an autistic individual is experiencing a 'shutdown' rather than a psychiatric emergency?",
            "options": [
                "Intense vocalizations and physical thrashing",
                "Dissociative-like withdrawal and reduced responsiveness to external stimuli",
                "Acute hallucinations and paranoid ideation",
                "Rapid onset of high fever and seizures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shutdowns are internalizing responses to sensory or emotional overload characterized by withdrawal and reduced interaction, whereas psychiatric emergencies often involve active psychosis or acute medical distress."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "According to research on suicidality in the autistic population, which factor is significantly correlated with increased suicidal ideation but often overlooked in standard risk assessments?",
            "options": [
                "High IQ scores",
                "Social camouflaging (masking)",
                "Excessive use of AAC devices",
                "Adherence to strict routines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social camouflaging or masking is a significant predictor of suicidality in autistic individuals due to the chronic exhaustion, loss of identity, and psychological strain it imposes."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "When an autistic individual with a high pain threshold exhibits a sudden increase in Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB), what is the first clinical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate implementation of a behavioral punishment protocol",
                "Rule out underlying medical issues or physical pain",
                "Increase sensory stimulation through weighted blankets",
                "Refer for an immediate involuntary psychiatric hold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SIB is frequently a form of communication for physical pain (such as dental abscesses or GI distress) that the individual cannot otherwise express; medical causes must be ruled out first."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A 'Neuro-Inclusive Collaborative Safety Plan' differs from a traditional safety plan primarily because it:",
            "options": [

                "Requires the removal of all sensory items from the home environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-inclusive safety planning focuses on the individual's specific sensory needs, communication preferences, and unique triggers rather than just general risk mitigation."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "During a 'catastrophic reaction' involving physical aggression, what is the most effective trauma-informed response?",

                "Attempting to engage the individual in a complex logical debate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-arousal approaches reduce the threat perception in the nervous system, which is critical for de-escalating an autistic crisis without causing further trauma."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "What does the term 'Recovery Baseline' refer to in post-crisis management?",

                "The individual's behavior immediately after the peak of a meltdown",
                "The point where the individual returns to their pre-crisis level of physiological and emotional regulation",
                "The minimum amount of medication required to prevent a future crisis",
                "The legal standard for discharging a patient from an inpatient unit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The recovery baseline is the return to the individual's 'normal' state of functioning, which may take hours or even days depending on the neurological impact of the crisis."

                "Confiscating the individual's AAC device to prevent it from being used as a weapon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory modifications, such as dimming lights and providing a quiet space, are essential for preventing sensory overload, which is a major trigger for meltdowns in medical settings."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Meltdown vs. Psychiatric Emergency,' which sign would most likely indicate a psychiatric emergency requiring immediate medical intervention?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While meltdowns involve emotional/sensory dysregulation, command hallucinations and catatonia are clinical signs of a psychiatric or medical emergency that requires specialized care."

            "id": "q28_10",

            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Exactly 10% across all demographics",

                "Over 95% of the general autistic population"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that for 30-50% of autistic individuals exhibiting SIB, the behavior is linked to communication barriers regarding internal physical or emotional states."
