            "id": "q25_1",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1, what is the primary shift required when moving from traditional clinical supervision to a Neuro-Affirming Supervision model?",
            "options": [
                "Shifting from a top-down compliance-based hierarchy to a collaborative, psychologically safe partnership",
                "Increasing the frequency of performance reviews to ensure clinical accuracy",
                "Focusing exclusively on the supervisee's ability to reduce autistic traits in clients",
                "Standardizing all supervision sessions to ensure every practitioner receives identical instruction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming supervision prioritizes psychological safety and collaboration, moving away from traditional power hierarchies to support the practitioner's unique neuro-type and professional growth."

        {
            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "When mentoring a supervisee on the Baseline Profile (B), which 'red flag' indicates the supervisee may be overlooking 'masking' in their assessment?",
            "options": [
                "The supervisee notes that the client's sensory needs change based on the environment",
                "The supervisee reports a 'perfect' baseline in structured settings but high levels of exhaustion post-session",
                "The supervisee identifies specific strengths in the client's cognitive profile",
                "The supervisee uses a 'Spiky Profile' graph to illustrate skill variance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'perfect' baseline in structured settings followed by extreme exhaustion is a classic indicator of masking; mentors must teach supervisees to look beyond surface-level compliance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Advanced Feedback Loops, what is the 'Feed-Forward' approach in reflective practice?",
            "options": [
                "A method of providing criticism before a task is even attempted",
                "Focusing on future solutions and growth opportunities rather than dwelling on past mistakes",
                "The process of the supervisor giving all the feedback without supervisee input",
                "A system of rewarding practitioners only after they meet specific KPIs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Feed-forward focuses on future performance and growth, which reduces the 'threat response' in neurodivergent practitioners and encourages proactive skill development."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A supervisee is struggling to support a client's autonomy (G). Using the 'Support-Challenge Matrix' from Lesson 4, what should a supervisor do if the supervisee is in the 'High Challenge / Low Support' quadrant?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the difficulty of the supervisee's caseload to build resilience",
                "Decrease the challenge and increase support to prevent burnout and 'quiet quitting'",
                "Maintain the challenge but ignore the support needs to foster independence",
                "Move them immediately to a different department"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High challenge with low support leads to stress and burnout. A supervisor must increase support (scaffolding, resources, emotional safety) to move the supervisee into the 'Growth' quadrant."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Double Empathy Problem' is applied to supervision. How does this manifest in a conflict between a neurotypical supervisor and a neurodivergent supervisee?",
            "options": [
                "The supervisee lacks the empathy to understand the supervisor's instructions",
                "A mutual breakdown in communication where both parties fail to understand the other's internal logic and communication style",
                "The supervisor is too empathetic, leading to a lack of professional boundaries",
                "The conflict is caused solely by the supervisee's neurological deficits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication breakdowns occur due to a mismatch in social expectations and processing styles between different neuro-types, not a deficit in one individual."

            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "When designing an Inclusive Supervised Environment (D) as discussed in Lesson 6, which element is considered a 'Sensory Audit' requirement for the supervision space?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the room has bright, fluorescent lighting to keep the supervisee alert",
                "Removing all visual aids to prevent distraction",
                "Evaluating lighting, acoustics, and seating options to minimize sensory load for the supervisee",
                "Requiring all supervision to take place in a busy, high-traffic common area"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inclusive leadership involves modifying the environment to reduce sensory overwhelm, which allows the supervisee to focus on the content of the supervision."

        {
            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "What is a primary advantage of the 'Reflecting Team' model in Group Supervision (Lesson 7)?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the supervisor to take a break while the group talks",
                "It provides multiple neuro-affirming perspectives on a single case, reducing individual supervisor bias",
                "It is the fastest way to complete supervision for a large number of staff",
                "It ensures that the most senior member's opinion is the only one heard"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Reflecting Team model leverages group diversity to offer varied perspectives, which is essential for complex neuro-affirming casework."

            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the difference between 'Burnout' and 'Compassion Fatigue' for L3 Leaders?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is related to workload and environment; Compassion Fatigue is the emotional residue of working with those suffering from trauma",
                "Burnout only happens to neurodivergent leaders; Compassion Fatigue only happens to neurotypical leaders",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms",
                "Burnout is a physical illness, while Compassion Fatigue is a lack of professional interest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Burnout is systemic and workload-related, whereas Compassion Fatigue (or Vicarious Trauma) is specifically related to the emotional impact of the therapeutic or supportive relationship."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A mentor notices a supervisee consistently writes goals that focus on 'reducing hand-flapping.' Which supervisory intervention aligns with Lesson 2 (Mentoring the Baseline)?",
            "options": [
                "Congratulate the supervisee on identifying a clear behavioral target",
                "Explain how to use more effective punishment procedures to stop the behavior",
                "Guide the supervisee to investigate the sensory or regulatory function of the behavior and rewrite the goal to support regulation",
                "Tell the supervisee to ignore the behavior and focus on academic goals instead"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming mentoring involves moving away from suppressing stimming and toward understanding its functional role in self-regulation."

            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study on practitioner retention found that neurodivergent staff were 60% more likely to remain in their roles when they experienced which type of supervision?",
            "options": [
                "High-frequency, directive supervision",
                "Supervision that utilized 'Identity-First' language and validated their lived experience",
                "Supervision that focused solely on clinical billing and documentation",
                "Supervision that was conducted by a supervisor of the exact same age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lived-experience validation and the use of identity-first language are core components of neuro-affirming leadership that directly impact staff retention and job satisfaction."
