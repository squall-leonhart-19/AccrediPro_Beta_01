            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "According to the Two-Process Model of Sleep Regulation, what substance accumulates in the brain throughout the day to create 'Process S' (Homeostatic Sleep Pressure)?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin",
                "Cortisol",
                "Adenosine",
                "Dopamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adenosine is a byproduct of energy consumption in the brain; its accumulation creates the 'sleep drive' or homeostatic pressure that increases the longer we stay awake."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In contrast to adults who spend about 20-25% of their sleep in REM, newborns spend approximately what percentage of their total sleep time in REM (active) sleep?",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "30%",
                "50%",
                "80%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Newborns spend roughly 50% of their sleep in REM, which is vital for the intense brain development and neural mapping occurring during the first months of life."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "The '4-month sleep regression' is biologically significant because it marks which permanent change in a child's development?",
            "options": [
                "The first major growth spurt of the skeletal system",
                "The maturation of sleep architecture from two stages to four distinct NREM stages",
                "The complete cessation of the Moro reflex",
                "The transition from a 2-nap to a 1-nap schedule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 4-month regression is actually a progression where infant sleep cycles mature to look more like adult cycles, including the introduction of lighter NREM stages that make them more prone to waking."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "If a child is 'overtired,' the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis triggers the release of which hormone that acts as a stimulant, making it harder for the child to settle?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Cortisol",
                "Leptin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a stress hormone that promotes alertness. When a child misses their optimal sleep window, cortisol levels rise, leading to a 'second wind' that interferes with sleep onset."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "A child who requires deep pressure, heavy blankets (if age-appropriate), or firm swaddling to calm down is likely seeking input for which sensory system?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular",
                "Proprioceptive",
                "Olfactory",
                "Tactile-Defensive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The proprioceptive system processes input from muscles and joints. Deep pressure provides organizing and calming input to the nervous system, helping a child regulate for sleep."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Based on Mary Ainsworth’s 'Secure Base' phenomenon in Attachment Theory, how does a secure attachment typically influence sleep training outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Securely attached children never cry during sleep transitions",
                "Securely attached children are unable to sleep independently",
                "A secure attachment provides the emotional foundation for a child to feel safe enough to explore independent sleep",
                "Attachment has no measurable impact on sleep behaviors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secure attachment creates an 'internal working model' of safety. When a child knows their caregiver is a reliable 'secure base,' they are more capable of managing the 'exploration' of independent sleep."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Which nutritional component is a necessary precursor for the synthesis of Serotonin and eventually Melatonin?",

                "Iron",
                "Vitamin D",
                "Tryptophan",
                "Glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that the body uses to produce serotonin, which is then converted into melatonin in the pineal gland in response to darkness."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Which of the following symptoms is a 'Red Flag' for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and requires a medical referral rather than behavioral intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Waking up at 5:00 AM daily",
                "Crying for 5 minutes when placed in the crib",
                "Frequent audible snoring, mouth breathing, or gasping during sleep",
                "Refusing to nap in a stroller"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Snoring and mouth breathing are signs of airway obstruction. Sleep coaches should never treat sleep issues that have an underlying medical/respiratory cause."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "How do infant sleep cycles differ in length from adult sleep cycles?",
            "options": [
                "Infant cycles are longer, lasting 120 minutes",
                "Infant cycles are shorter, lasting approximately 45-50 minutes",
                "Infant cycles are the same length as adults (90 minutes)",
                "Infants do not have sleep cycles until age 2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Infant sleep cycles are significantly shorter (45-50 minutes) than adult cycles (90-120 minutes), which is why many infants wake frequently or struggle to connect cycles."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A 3-year-old wakes up screaming 90 minutes after bedtime. He appears awake but is unresponsive to comfort and has no memory of the event the next morning. This most likely describes:",

                "A Nightmare",
                "Separation Anxiety",

                "Behavioral Insomnia of Childhood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Night terrors occur during deep NREM sleep, typically in the first third of the night. The child is not fully awake, cannot be easily comforted, and will have no recollection of the event."
