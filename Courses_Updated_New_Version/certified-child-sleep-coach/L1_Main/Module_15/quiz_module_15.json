            "question": "In the S.L.U.M.B.E.R. Method™ framework, what does the 'B' represent, and why is it considered the 'glue' of the process?",
            "options": [
                "Biological Rhythms; it ensures the child is physiologically ready for sleep.",
                "Behavioral Consistency; it prevents intermittent reinforcement which can strengthen unwanted sleep associations.",
                "Bedtime Routine; it creates the psychological bridge between wakefulness and sleep.",
                "Boundary Setting; it establishes the coach's authority over the parental unit."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Behavioral Consistency (the 'B') is critical because inconsistency leads to intermittent reinforcement, which makes a behavior much harder to extinguish according to operant conditioning principles."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "During a Situational Assessment (L2), a coach notes a family has a high 'Chaos Index.' According to the module, how should this impact the initial plan?",
            "options": [
                "The coach should implement the most aggressive method to see fast results.",
                "The coach should focus on environment first before any behavioral changes are made.",
                "The coach should delay the start until the family moves to a larger home.",
                "The coach should use a highly structured, low-nuance method to reduce parental decision fatigue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-chaos environments, optimizing the 'Layout' (Environment) provides an immediate, low-stress win that builds parental self-efficacy before moving into more challenging behavioral work."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to Layout Optimization (L3) standards, what is the 'Goldilocks Zone' for nursery temperature to support the natural drop in core body temperature?",
            "options": [
                "60-64°F (15.5-17.7°C)",
                "68-72°F (20-22.2°C)",
                "74-78°F (23.3-25.5°C)",
                "Temperature does not impact sleep as long as the child is swaddled."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A room temperature between 68-72°F is recommended to facilitate the body's natural thermoregulation process, which is necessary for deep, restorative sleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "A 7-month-old client is seen pulling their ears and turning their head away from toys. Based on Lesson 4 (Understanding Cues), how should a coach interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "Early Cues; the parent should begin the wind-down routine immediately.",
                "Late Cues; the child is already overtired and may experience a cortisol spike.",
                "Physical Discomfort; the child likely has an ear infection and needs medical referral.",
                "Boredom Cues; the child needs more sensory stimulation before sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ear pulling and disengagement (turning away) are classic 'Early Cues' indicating the sleep window is opening. Acting now prevents the child from becoming overtired."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "When selecting a methodology (L5) for a child with a 'Slow-to-Warm-Up' temperament, which approach is typically most successful?",
            "options": [
                "Extinction (Cry It Out), as it provides the clearest boundary.",
                "Chair Method (Fading), as it allows the child to process the presence of the parent while learning the new skill.",
                "Timed Checks (Ferber), as the intermittent entry provides the necessary comfort.",
                "No-Cry methods, as these children cannot handle any level of frustration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow-to-warm-up children often struggle with sudden changes. A fading method like the Chair Method allows them to adapt gradually to the parent's decreasing involvement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In Behavioral Consistency (L6), the '80/20 Rule' for habit reinforcement suggests that:",
            "options": [
                "80% of children will respond to any method within 20 days.",
                "Parents must be 100% consistent for the first 14 days, then can drop to 80% consistency.",
                "A plan must be followed exactly 80% of the time to be effective.",
                "20% of the child's behavior drives 80% of the parental stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes total consistency during the initial 'learning phase' (usually 14 days) to establish the new habit before introducing the flexibility of the maintenance phase."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "During the Evaluation & Refinement phase (L7), a coach sees that a child's 'Time to Fall Asleep' (TTFA) has decreased, but night wakings have increased. What is the most likely 'Pivot' required?",
            "options": [
                "The child is being put down too early (Under-tired).",
                "The child has developed a 'Space-Association' where they need the crib moved.",
                "The child is likely experiencing a 'Regression' and the plan should be paused.",
                "The child is likely over-tired by bedtime due to poor day naps, leading to fragmented night sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "If TTFA is low (falling asleep instantly) but night wakings are high, it often indicates the child is crashing from exhaustion (over-tiredness), which causes more frequent arousals later in the night."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Restorative Maintenance (L8) defines 'Sleep Hygiene' for toddlers as including which specific environmental factor to support circadian health?",
            "options": [
                "Using a red-toned nightlight to avoid suppressing melatonin production.",
                "Keeping a television on low volume to provide white noise.",
                "Ensuring the room is at least 50% bright during naps to distinguish day from night.",
                "Using blue-light filters on tablets 30 minutes before bed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Red light has the least impact on melatonin production, whereas blue or white light can suppress it and interfere with the circadian rhythm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A case study in Module 15 describes a child who 'protests' for 20 minutes every night at the same time. If the parent enters the room at the 15-minute mark on some nights but not others, what is being created?",
            "options": [
                "A secure attachment bond.",
                "An 'Intermittent Reinforcement Schedule' that encourages longer protests.",
                "A 'Testing Phase' that is a normal part of the toddler developmental leap.",
                "Negative Practice, where the child learns to hate the crib."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful schedule for maintaining a behavior. By occasionally giving in, the parent teaches the child that if they cry long enough, the parent will eventually appear."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Restorative Maintenance' phase (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "To sell the client a second coaching package for the next age milestone.",
                "To transition the child from a crib to a toddler bed as soon as possible.",
                "To empower parents with the 'Adaptive Toolkit' to handle future disruptions like illness or travel.",
                "To ensure the child never cries again during a sleep transition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ultimate goal of a professional coach is to make themselves obsolete by giving parents the tools and knowledge to manage future sleep challenges independently."
