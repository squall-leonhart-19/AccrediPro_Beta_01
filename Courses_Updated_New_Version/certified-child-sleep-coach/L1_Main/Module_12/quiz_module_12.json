            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "According to the Foundations of Pediatric Sleep Science (L1), which neurochemical is primarily responsible for 'sleep pressure' and is cleared from the brain during restorative sleep?",
            "options": ["Melatonin", "Cortisol", "Adenosine", "Dopamine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adenosine builds up in the basal forebrain throughout the day, creating homeostatic sleep pressure. It is cleared during sleep, which is why a late-day nap can 'reset' the pressure and make bedtime difficult."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "During the 'S' (Situational Assessment) phase, which of the following 'red flag' symptoms discovered in the Intake Blueprint should trigger an immediate referral to a pediatric ENT or sleep specialist?",
            "options": ["Frequent night wakings every 3 hours", "Chronic mouth breathing and audible snoring", "Resistance to the 4-to-3 nap transition", "Preference for a specific lovey or pacifier"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mouth breathing and snoring are clinical indicators of potential Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) or Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which must be medically cleared before behavioral sleep training begins."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "In Layout Optimization (L3), what is the primary reason for recommending a 'Pitch Black' environment (Level 10 on the darkness scale)?",
            "options": ["To prevent the child from seeing toys and getting distracted", "To maximize natural melatonin production and prevent suppression", "To ensure the child stays in the crib for the full duration", "To lower the core body temperature of the infant"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Even low levels of light, particularly in the blue spectrum (460-480nm), can suppress melatonin production by the pineal gland, making it harder for the child to transition between sleep cycles."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When 'Understanding Biological Sleep Cues' (L4), a child who suddenly becomes hyperactive, clumsy, or begins 'second-wind' behavior is likely experiencing:",
            "options": ["An optimal sleep window opening", "A peak in the circadian alerting signal", "A cortisol spike due to being overtired", "The beginning of a REM sleep cycle"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a child misses their optimal sleep window, the body compensates by releasing cortisol and adrenaline (the 'second wind'), which makes falling asleep significantly more difficult."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In 'Methodology Selection' (L5), which temperament type typically requires a 'low-and-slow' approach (like the Chair Method) rather than 'Stay-and-Support' or 'Spaced Soothing'?",
            "options": ["The 'Easy' or Flexible child", "The 'Slow-to-Warm' or Sensitive child", "The 'Spirited' or High-Intensity child", "The 'Distractible' child"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensitive or 'Slow-to-Warm' children often experience high levels of separation anxiety and may become overstimulated by frequent 'check-ins,' making a gradual, present-in-room approach more effective."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "The 'Behavioral Consistency' (L6) phase warns of the 'Extinction Burst.' When does this phenomenon typically occur during the implementation of a new sleep plan?",
            "options": ["On the very first night", "Between nights 3 and 5", "Exactly 14 days after starting", "Only during the morning nap"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Extinction Burst is a temporary increase in the frequency or intensity of the unwanted behavior (crying/protesting) usually occurring between nights 3-5 as the child makes a final effort to return to the old reinforcement pattern."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "During 'Evaluation & Data Analysis' (L7), you notice a client's 7-month-old is consistently experiencing 'False Starts' (waking 45-60 minutes after bedtime). What is the most likely cause?",
            "options": ["The child is overstimulated by the nursery decor", "The child is undertired and needs a longer final wake window", "The child is overtired or has an inconsistent bedtime routine", "The child is experiencing a growth spurt"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "False starts are most frequently caused by overtiredness (cortisol interference) or a lack of independent sleep skills at the initial bedtime onset."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In 'Restorative Maintenance' (L8), the '80/20 Rule' suggests that:",
            "options": ["80% of sleep must be in the crib, 20% can be on-the-go", "80% of children will regress, 20% will not", "80% of the plan must be followed for 20% of the results", "20% of sleep issues are biological, 80% are behavioral"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule provides flexibility for families, suggesting that if sleep is handled consistently 80% of the time, the child's sleep foundation can withstand the 20% of 'life' (travel, illness, special events)."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A case study in L2 involves a 4-month-old experiencing the 'Pro-Regression.' What is the biological driver of this permanent change in sleep architecture?",
            "options": ["The emergence of the first tooth", "The transition from 2-stage newborn sleep to 4-stage adult-like sleep cycles", "An increase in caloric needs for rolling", "The development of object permanence"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At approximately 4 months, infant sleep matures from two stages (Active/Quiet) into four stages, including more time in light NREM sleep, which leads to more frequent 'wake-ups' between cycles."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "According to 'Future-Proofing' (L8), what is the recommended age range to transition a child from a crib to a toddler bed to minimize sleep disruptions?",
            "options": ["18 to 24 months", "As soon as they can pull to a stand", "Ideally as close to 3 years old as possible", "Whenever the parents decide to redecorate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Waiting until age 3 is recommended because children typically lack the cognitive 'impulse control' required to stay in an open bed until that age, leading to 'curtain calls' and bedtime battles."
