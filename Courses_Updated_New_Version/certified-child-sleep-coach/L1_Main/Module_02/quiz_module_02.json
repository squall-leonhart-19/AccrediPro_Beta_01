            "question": "According to the safety standards discussed in Lesson 2, what is the maximum allowable distance between crib slats to prevent infant head entrapment?",
            "options": [
                "3 inches (7.6 cm)",
                "2 3/8 inches (6 cm)",
                "2 1/2 inches (6.4 cm)",
                "2 1/8 inches (5.4 cm)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To meet CPSC and AAP safety standards, crib slats must be no more than 2 3/8 inches (6 cm) apart to prevent a child's head from becoming wedged between the bars."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the context of photobiology (Lesson 3), which specific wavelength range of light is most aggressive at suppressing melatonin production in the human brain?",
            "options": [
                "620–750 nm (Red light)",
                "570–590 nm (Yellow light)",
                "460–480 nm (Blue light)",
                "500–565 nm (Green light)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Short-wavelength 'blue' light, specifically in the 460–480 nm range, has the highest sensitivity for the melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells that regulate the circadian clock."

            "question": "A client's nursery is consistently maintained at 71°F (21.6°C). Based on the TOG (Thermal Overall Grade) guidelines in Lesson 4, which sleep sack rating is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 TOG",
                "1.0 TOG",
                "2.5 TOG",
                "3.5 TOG"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 1.0 TOG sleep sack is designed for standard room temperatures between 69–73°F (21–23°C). A 2.5 TOG would be too heavy (for colder rooms), and a 0.5 TOG is typically for very warm rooms."

            "question": "When performing an Environmental Audit (Lesson 8), where should the decibel meter be placed to ensure white noise is at a safe level for the infant's hearing?",
            "options": [
                "Directly next to the sound machine",
                "At the door of the nursery",
                "At the 'head' position inside the crib",
                "Underneath the mattress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sound levels must be measured from the infant's perspective. To ensure the sound does not exceed the recommended 50 dB for prolonged exposure, the measurement must be taken where the infant's head will actually rest."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "The 'Pink Noise' spectrum differs from 'White Noise' in what specific way, according to the Acoustic Environment science in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "It has higher power at lower frequencies, creating a deeper sound",
                "It is significantly louder than white noise",
                "It only includes high-frequency chirping sounds",
                "It is a digital-only sound that cannot be replicated by fans"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pink noise has more power at lower frequencies and less at higher frequencies, making it sound 'bassier' or deeper than white noise, which many studies suggest is more conducive to stable sleep."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "During a sensory assessment (Lesson 6), a coach notices a child is highly sensitive to tactile input and struggles with polyester pajamas. Which fabric is recommended for its breathability and hypoallergenic properties?",
            "options": [
                "Nylon",
                "Heavy-weight fleece",
                "Bamboo or Organic Cotton",
                "Microfiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Natural fibers like bamboo and organic cotton are highly breathable, help with thermoregulation, and are less likely to irritate children with tactile sensitivities or eczema."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "The AAP recommends room-sharing (but not bed-sharing) for at least how long to reduce the risk of SIDS?",
            "options": [
                "The first 2 weeks",
                "The first 3 months",
                "The first 6 months",
                "Until the child is 2 years old"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AAP recommends room-sharing without bed-sharing for at least the first 6 months, and ideally for the first year, as it has been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS by up to 50%."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which tool is essential during a professional Layout Optimization audit to measure the level of light intrusion in a 'blackout' environment?",
            "options": [
                "Hygrometer",
                "Lux Meter",
                "Anemometer",
                "Barometer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Lux meter measures illuminance. In a sleep audit, it is used to ensure the room reaches as close to 0 lux as possible for optimal melatonin secretion."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "If a child is showing signs of 'heat rash' or has a sweaty chest during sleep, which intervention is most urgent according to Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "Adding a fan to the room immediately",
                "Applying lotion to the rash",
                "Lowering the room temperature or reducing clothing layers",
                "Moving the crib closer to a window"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Overheating is a significant risk factor for SIDS. Immediate action should be taken to cool the child by adjusting the thermostat or removing layers (lowering the TOG value of their sleepwear)."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, what is the 'Visual Barrier' strategy used for in room-sharing dynamics?",
            "options": [
                "To hide the crib from the parents' view",
                "To prevent the infant from seeing the parents if they wake up, reducing signaling",
                "To block the sound of the parents' breathing",
                "To prevent the baby from climbing out of the crib"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A visual barrier (like a slumber pod or room divider) helps prevent the 'social wake' where an infant sees their parents upon a partial arousal and signals for attention rather than transitioning back to sleep."
