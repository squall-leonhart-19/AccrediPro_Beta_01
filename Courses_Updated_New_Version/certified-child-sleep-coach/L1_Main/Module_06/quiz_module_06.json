            "question": "When analyzing a client's sleep log, what is the primary distinction between 'Time in Bed' and 'Total Sleep Time' that a coach must identify to calculate Sleep Efficiency?",
            "options": [
                "The difference between the first nap and the last nap",
                "The duration between lights out and morning wake-up versus actual hours spent asleep",
                "The time spent feeding versus the time spent soothing",
                "The difference between the child's biological clock and the parent's desired schedule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is calculated by dividing Total Sleep Time by Total Time in Bed. Distinguishing these two metrics is essential for identifying whether a sleep issue is behavioral or schedule-based."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "A 9-month-old client is experiencing Early Morning Wakings (EMWs) at 5:15 AM. The sleep log shows the child is happy and babbling for 45 minutes before crying. What is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "Overtiredness from a late bedtime",
                "A hunger-induced wake-up requiring a caloric increase",
                "Undertiredness caused by excessive daytime sleep or wake windows that are too short",
                "Environmental noise from neighborhood traffic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Happy, 'content' wake-ups in the early morning usually indicate 'low sleep pressure,' suggesting the child has had enough sleep and the schedule needs more wake time during the day."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Quantitative Analysis, what Sleep Efficiency percentage is generally considered the 'Gold Standard' for a successfully sleep-trained child?",
            "options": [
                "70-75%",
                "80-85%",
                "85-95%",
                "100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Sleep Efficiency of 85-95% is considered optimal. 100% is unrealistic due to brief natural arousals, and below 80% usually indicates a need for schedule or method refinement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "During the 3-to-2 nap transition, what is the most effective 'Strategic Pivot' if the child cannot make it to a 7:00 PM bedtime without becoming overtired?",
            "options": [
                "Offering a 15-20 minute 'bridge nap' no later than 4:30 PM",
                "Moving bedtime to 5:30 PM permanently",
                "Allowing the child to sleep as long as they want during Nap 2",
                "Increasing milk intake in the late afternoon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A short bridge nap (15-20 mins) can reduce sleep pressure just enough to reach a standard bedtime without interfering with night sleep, acting as a temporary solution during transitions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A client's child has started crawling and is now 'practicing' in the crib at night, leading to increased night wakings. What is the recommended coaching intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately switch to a more restrictive sleep training method",
                "Allow 'floor time' for practice during the day and maintain consistency at night",
                "Physically roll the child back over every time they move",
                "End the sleep training plan until the milestone is fully mastered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motor milestones cause temporary sleep disruptions. Coaches should encourage daytime practice to help the brain 'file' the new skill and advise parents to stay consistent with their response at night."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "What is 'The Forbidden Zone' (Circadian Peak) and how does it impact bedtime refinement?",
            "options": [
                "The period after midnight when growth hormone is at its lowest",
                "The 1-2 hour window before biological bedtime when the body's alerting signal is strongest",
                "The time during a nap when a child is most likely to have a bowel movement",
                "The 3:00 AM dip in body temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Forbidden Zone is a period of high alertness just before the drive for sleep takes over. Trying to force a bedtime during this peak often results in intense crying and resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, which of the following is identified as a primary reason to 'Pivot' the methodology from a gradual approach (like Chair Method) to a more direct approach?",
            "options": [
                "The child is crying for 10 minutes",
                "The parents are feeling bored with the process",
                "Parental presence is overstimulating the child and escalating the crying",
                "The child has a mild cold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a gradual method (like the Chair Method) results in escalating 'protest' because the parent's presence is frustrating the child, a pivot to a method with less intervention is often necessary."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "When a child is ill, what is the '24-Hour Rule' for resuming a sleep training plan?",
            "options": [
                "Wait 24 hours after the first dose of antibiotics",
                "Wait 24 hours after the child has been fever-free without the use of medication",
                "Wait 24 hours after the child stops coughing",
                "Wait 24 hours after the parents feel rested enough to start again"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To ensure the child is physically ready to resume learning, they should be fever-free for a full 24 hours without the assistance of fever-reducing medications."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "If a sleep log shows a 'Sleep Latency' of consistently less than 3 minutes (the child falls asleep almost instantly), what should a coach suspect?",
            "options": [
                "The child is a 'perfect' sleeper",
                "The wake window is too short",
                "The child is chronically overtired and the wake window is too long",
                "The room temperature is too warm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While parents often love an instant sleep-onset, a latency of under 5 minutes frequently indicates significant sleep debt or an excessively long wake window leading to a 'crash'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "When delivering a mid-point evaluation to a discouraged client, which 'Coaching' technique is most effective for maintaining adherence?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing only on what the parents are doing wrong",
                "Highlighting 'Small Wins' in the data (e.g., shorter duration of crying) before addressing refinements",
                "Telling the parents they must work harder or the plan will fail",
                "Ignoring the data and focusing only on the parents' emotions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Highlighting objective 'Small Wins' (found in data analysis) helps build parental self-efficacy and encourages them to remain consistent with the necessary refinements."
