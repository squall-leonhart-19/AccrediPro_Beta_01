            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Future-Proofing Roadmap' provided during case closure?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a rigid schedule that must be followed until the child is five years old",
                "To empower parents with the knowledge to troubleshoot future disruptions independently",
                "To ensure the coach is retained for monthly follow-up sessions indefinitely",
                "To guarantee that the child will never experience another sleep regression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future-proofing is about education and empowerment, giving parents the tools to handle developmental leaps, illness, and travel without needing to restart the entire coaching process."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "The 4-month sleep regression is unique because it represents which of the following biological changes?",
            "options": [
                "A temporary increase in caloric needs during a growth spurt",
                "The development of the startle (Moro) reflex",
                "A permanent maturation of sleep architecture into adult-like stages",
                "The peak of separation anxiety and object permanence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike other regressions that are behavioral or developmental, the 4-month regression marks a permanent shift where sleep cycles become more complex, involving distinct stages of NREM and REM sleep similar to adults."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Based on the development of the prefrontal cortex and impulse control, what is the recommended minimum age for the crib-to-bed transition?",
            "options": [
                "3 years old",
                "18 months old",
                "2 years old",
                "When the child first starts walking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Children typically lack the cognitive impulse control to stay in a bed without physical boundaries (crib rails) until approximately age 3. Transitioning earlier often leads to 'curtain calling' and bedtime stalling."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A family is traveling across four time zones. According to the '80/20 Rule' discussed in the module, how should they handle sleep consistency?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain 100% consistency regardless of the environment to avoid setbacks",
                "Abandon all sleep rules during travel and restart training upon return",
                "Aim for 80% consistency with core habits while allowing for 20% flexibility due to travel constraints",
                "Only follow sleep rules during the 20% of the time the child is in the hotel"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule suggests that if parents maintain core sleep hygiene 80% of the time, the child's sleep foundation can withstand the 20% of 'life' disruptions like travel or special events."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a definitive sign that a toddler is ready to transition from two naps to one?",
            "options": [
                "The child cries for 5 minutes at the start of the morning nap",
                "The child consistently refuses the afternoon nap for 2+ weeks or the morning nap becomes too long, pushing bedtime late",
                "The child has reached their first birthday",
                "The child starts waking up at 6:00 AM instead of 7:00 AM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2-to-1 transition is usually characterized by consistent nap refusal or a morning nap that interferes with the rest of the day's schedule, typically occurring between 13-18 months."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "The 8-10 month sleep regression is primarily driven by which developmental milestone?",
            "options": [
                "The introduction of solid foods",
                "The peak of the 'forbidden zone' of wakefulness",
                "Rapid physical milestones (crawling/pulling up) and the emergence of object permanence",
                "A significant drop in melatonin production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 8-10 month regression is heavily linked to physical milestones like crawling and the cognitive development of object permanence, which increases separation anxiety."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "When a child becomes ill, what is the 'Restorative Maintenance' protocol for a sleep coach to recommend?",
            "options": [
                "Comfort the child as needed, even if it means temporary sleep associations, then return to the original plan once healthy",
                "Strictly maintain all sleep training boundaries to ensure the child gets the rest they need to heal",
                "Move the child into the parents' bed permanently to monitor breathing",
                "Stop all naps to ensure the child is tired enough to sleep through the night while sick"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Illness requires a 'pause' in formal training to prioritize comfort and hydration. Once the child is symptom-free for 24-48 hours, parents should return to their established sleep boundaries."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Springing Forward' for Daylight Savings Time, how should a coach advise a parent to adjust a child who is sensitive to overtiredness?",
            "options": [
                "Do nothing and let the child adjust naturally over a month",
                "Move the entire schedule 15-30 minutes earlier each day for several days leading up to the change",
                "Move the schedule 15-30 minutes later each day after the change",
                "Keep the child awake until 10:00 PM the night before to ensure a late wake-up"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For the 'Spring Forward' shift (losing an hour), moving the schedule slightly earlier in the days leading up to the change helps the child's internal clock synchronize with the new time without a massive jump."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A 2.5-year-old child begins expressing a fear of the dark. What is the most appropriate 'Toddler Dynamics' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the child there is nothing to be afraid of and close the door",
                "Begin sleeping in the child's room until the fear passes",
                "Validate the emotion, introduce a dim (warm-toned) nightlight, and maintain the 'check-in' boundary",
                "Immediately transition the child to a toddler bed so they can come find the parents"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validating the fear while maintaining boundaries is key. A warm-toned nightlight (red/orange) provides comfort without suppressing melatonin, and consistent check-ins provide security without creating new dependencies."

        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Forbidden Zone' in pediatric sleep science?",
            "options": [
                "The period between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM when the body temperature is lowest",
                "A period of high alertness and low sleep pressure occurring about 1-2 hours before the biological bedtime",
                "The 30 minutes immediately following a nap when sleep inertia is highest",
                "Any time a child is allowed to sleep in a car seat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Forbidden Zone' is a circadian phenomenon where the body's wake-promoting signal is at its strongest right before the onset of melatonin production, making it very difficult for a child to fall asleep if bedtime is too early."
