            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Situational Assessment' phase within the AccrediPro Sleep Coaching framework?",
            "options": [
                "To select the most effective crying-based sleep training method immediately.",
                "To gather comprehensive, multi-dimensional data to identify the root causes of sleep fragmentation.",
                "To provide the parents with a rigid schedule that must be followed for 14 days.",
                "To diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnea or chronic reflux."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Situational Assessment is about gathering data across all pillars (environment, biology, behavior) to create a tailored roadmap rather than jumping to a generic method."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During the analysis of a Sleep Intake Form, which 'red flag' symptom necessitates an immediate referral to a pediatric specialist before behavioral coaching begins?",
            "options": [
                "The child requires a pacifier to fall asleep at bedtime.",
                "The child wakes up twice per night for caloric intake at 5 months old.",
                "The child exhibits audible gasping, heavy snoring, or labored breathing during sleep.",
                "The child resists the transition from a crib to a toddler bed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gasping or heavy snoring are indicators of potential Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSA), which is a medical issue that must be cleared by a professional before behavioral intervention."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "At approximately what age does a significant shift in sleep architecture occur, where sleep becomes more adult-like with four distinct stages?",
            "options": [
                "6 weeks",
                "4 months",
                "9 months",
                "18 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '4-month sleep regression' is actually a permanent maturation of sleep architecture where infants move from 2 stages of sleep to the 4-stage cycles seen in adults."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A parent who is highly responsive to their child's emotional needs but struggles to enforce boundaries or maintain a consistent sleep schedule is demonstrating which parenting style?",

                "Authoritative",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Permissive parenting is characterized by high warmth/responsiveness but low demandingness/structure, which often leads to challenges in maintaining sleep consistency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "What is the defining characteristic of a 'problematic' sleep association (prop) versus a 'helpful' sleep association?",
            "options": [
                "The cost of the item used to soothe the child.",
                "Whether the association requires external parental intervention to be replicated during night wakes.",
                "Whether the association involves the use of white noise or a dark room.",
                "Whether the association was introduced before or after the 6-month mark."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A prop is problematic if the child cannot recreate it independently (e.g., being rocked to sleep). If the child can maintain it (e.g., a thumb or a well-placed pacifier for an older infant), it is considered helpful."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "In temperament profiling, a child with a 'Low Sensory Threshold' is most likely to:",
            "options": [
                "Sleep through loud noises and bright lights without waking.",
                "Be easily overstimulated by scratchy clothing, distant sounds, or slight temperature changes.",
                "Adapt very quickly to new environments and changes in the nap routine.",
                "Have a very predictable and rhythmic internal biological clock."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low threshold means it takes very little stimulus to trigger a reaction; these children are highly sensitive to their environment."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "The phenomenon of 'Reverse Cycling' is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "A baby who naps well during the day but refuses to sleep at night.",
                "A baby who consumes the majority of their required daily calories during the night, leading to frequent waking.",
                "A baby who reaches developmental milestones in a non-linear order.",
                "A baby whose REM and Non-REM cycles are flipped in duration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse cycling occurs when a baby compensates for low daytime intake by feeding frequently at night, which reinforces night waking patterns."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "When synthesizing assessment data, why is 'Biological Timing' (Circadian Rhythm) considered a higher priority than the specific sleep training technique?",
            "options": [
                "Because techniques are not scientifically proven to work.",
                "Because if a child is put down outside of their natural 'sleep window,' cortisol spikes will cause significant resistance regardless of the method used.",
                "Because parents find it easier to track time than to change their behavior.",
                "Because biological timing only matters for infants over the age of 12 months."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working with the body's natural sleep pressure and circadian rhythm reduces cortisol and adrenaline, making any behavioral intervention significantly more successful."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Case Study: An 8-month-old is waking every 2 hours. The intake reveals the baby is breastfed to sleep, the room has a bright nightlight, and the parents use an 'Authoritarian' approach with rigid, early bedtimes. What is the most likely primary driver of the frequent wakes?",
            "options": [
                "Hunger due to a growth spurt.",
                "Inappropriate sleep environment and a nursing-to-sleep association.",
                "The authoritarian parenting style causing emotional distress.",
                "A lack of physical activity during the day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While parenting style and nutrition play roles, the combination of a bright environment (suppressing melatonin) and a powerful sleep association (nursing) are the most direct drivers of fragmented sleep."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "According to the module, what is the 'Gold Standard' for verifying the accuracy of a parent's reported sleep challenges during the assessment?",
            "options": [
                "A 24-hour video recording of the nursery.",
                "A 3-to-7 day comprehensive sleep and nutrition log.",
                "A one-time 15-minute observation of the child's temperament.",
                "The parents' verbal description during the initial consultation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A multi-day log (3-7 days) provides objective data on patterns, timing, and associations that parents may misremember or overlook in a verbal interview."
