            "question": "In the S.L.U.M.B.E.R. Method™, what is the primary purpose of the 'Layout Optimization' phase before selecting a behavioral methodology?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the child is old enough for sleep training",
                "To eliminate environmental barriers that could sabotage even the best behavioral plan",
                "To establish a rigid 12-hour feeding schedule",
                "To determine if the child has a high-reactivity temperament"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Layout Optimization ensures the sleep sanctuary (light, sound, temperature) is conducive to sleep, preventing environmental factors from being mistaken for behavioral issues."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "During the 'Deep Dive Intake,' which of the following symptoms serves as a 'Red Flag' requiring a medical referral before sleep coaching begins?",
            "options": [
                "The child wakes twice per night for comfort",
                "The child cries for more than 10 minutes at bedtime",
                "Frequent loud snoring, gasping, or labored breathing during sleep",
                "The child prefers to sleep in a slightly tilted position"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Snoring or gasping are signs of potential Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSA), which is a medical condition that must be addressed by a physician before behavioral coaching."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Sleep Sanctuary' guidelines in Lesson 3, what is the recommended 'Gold Standard' for nursery darkness to prevent premature cortisol production?",
            "options": [
                "Level 5 (Dim enough to read a book)",
                "Level 8 (Visible shadows but no direct light)",
                "Level 10 (Total blackout where you cannot see your hand in front of your face)",
                "Level 2 (Soft nightlight to prevent fear of the dark)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Total blackout (Level 10) is recommended to maximize melatonin production and prevent early morning wakings caused by light sensitivity."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When a child misses their 'Biological Window' and becomes overtired, what physiological response occurs that makes it harder for them to fall asleep?",
            "options": [
                "A surge in melatonin levels",
                "A drop in core body temperature",
                "The 'Second Wind' caused by a surge of cortisol and adrenaline",
                "A rapid increase in Adenosine levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a child is awake past their window, the body compensates for fatigue by releasing cortisol and adrenaline, making them hyper-alert and harder to settle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "For a child identified as having a 'High-Reactivity' temperament, which methodology is typically most successful according to the S.L.U.M.B.E.R. framework?",
            "options": [
                "Full Extinction (Cry It Out)",
                "High-Support/Gradual Methods (e.g., The Chair Method)",
                "Timed Check-ins with 20-minute intervals",
                "No-cry methods that involve constant rocking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-reactivity children often find intermittent check-ins (like Ferber) overstimulating; gradual methods that provide consistent parental presence often work better for their sensory needs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Extinction Burst' phenomenon typically encountered during the 'Behavioral Consistency' phase (Lesson 6)?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden improvement in sleep on the first night",
                "A temporary, intense increase in the unwanted behavior (crying/protesting) just before it begins to disappear",
                "The point where a child completely stops crying forever",
                "A medical reaction to changes in the sleep environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An extinction burst is a normal part of behavioral change where the child 'tests' the new boundary with increased intensity before accepting the new routine."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In 'Data-Driven Troubleshooting' (Lesson 7), if a sleep log shows a child is consistently waking at 5:00 AM after a 7:00 PM bedtime, what is the most likely 'Evaluation'?",
            "options": [
                "The child is hungry and needs a dream feed",
                "The child has reached their total sleep pressure capacity for the 24-hour cycle",
                "The child is manipulative and wants attention",
                "The child is having a night terror"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early morning wakings often occur because the child has had enough sleep (e.g., 10 hours) and the remaining sleep pressure is too low to overcome the natural dawn cortisol rise."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "When 'Future-Proofing' results (Lesson 8), how should parents handle sleep during a period of acute illness?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain strict sleep training rules regardless of the illness",
                "Suspend formal training to offer necessary comfort and hydration, then return to the method once the child is 100% healthy",
                "Switch to a permanent co-sleeping arrangement",
                "Wake the child every hour to check their temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Illness requires 'Restorative Maintenance' where comfort is prioritized, but parents should return to their established boundaries as soon as the child is medically cleared."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module regarding 'Parental Consistency' found that the single greatest predictor of sleep coaching success was:",
            "options": [
                "The specific method chosen (e.g., Ferber vs. Chair)",
                "The age of the child at the start of training",
                "Parental adherence to the plan for at least 7-10 consecutive days",
                "The use of a specific brand of white noise machine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistency (Behavioral) is the 'B' in S.L.U.M.B.E.R. and is statistically shown to be more important than which specific 'Method' is used."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which 'Tired Sign' is considered a 'Late Stage' cue, indicating the biological window has likely already closed?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Stare' (zoning out)",
                "Reddening of the eyebrows",
                "Hyperactivity, physical clumsiness, or ear-pulling",
                "Decreased activity and vocalization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyperactivity and physical clumsiness are signs that the body has already entered a 'second wind' cortisol state, meaning the ideal window has passed."
