            "question": "What is the primary reason sleep experts recommend waiting until as close to age 3 as possible to transition a child from a crib to a toddler bed?",
            "options": [
                "Children under 3 lack the impulse control and cognitive maturity to understand 'invisible boundaries'.",
                "Cribs are safer for physical development and spinal alignment until age 3.",
                "Toddler beds are significantly more expensive to maintain.",
                "Most children do not reach the height requirement for a toddler bed until age 3."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cognitive readiness is the most critical factor; younger toddlers typically lack the impulse control to stay in a bed without physical rails."

                "If one twin wakes up, wake the other twin within 15-30 minutes to keep their schedules synchronized.",
                "Feed twins exactly 15 minutes apart to ensure digestion is tracked.",
                "Twin naps should never exceed 30 minutes in the afternoon."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synchronizing schedules is vital for parental sanity and consistency; waking the second twin shortly after the first helps maintain a unified rhythm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physical health and safety always take precedence; sleep training should be paused during acute illness to provide necessary support."

                "Night Terrors only happen to children over the age of 6."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Night terrors are partial arousals from deep Non-REM sleep where the child appears awake but is actually unresponsive and will have no memory of the event."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 18-month regression is heavily influenced by developmental milestones, specifically the 'reproachment' phase of separation anxiety and the 'No' stage."

            "options": [
                "To tire the child out so they eventually fall asleep on the floor.",
                "To avoid reinforcing the behavior by providing 'social reward' (attention, eye contact, or conversation).",
                "To show the child that the parent is angry.",
                "To ensure the child gets at least 12 hours of sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Any interaction—even negative—can be reinforcing for a toddler. The Silent Return makes the act of leaving the bed 'boring' and unproductive."

            "question": "In the context of the S.L.U.M.B.E.R. Method™, what does 'Maintaining Consistency' look like during a 2-year-old's 'boundary testing' phase?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistency is the antidote to boundary testing. Toddlers feel more secure when they know exactly where the limits are."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "According to research on circadian rhythms and travel, approximately how long does it take the body to adjust for every one hour of time zone difference?",
