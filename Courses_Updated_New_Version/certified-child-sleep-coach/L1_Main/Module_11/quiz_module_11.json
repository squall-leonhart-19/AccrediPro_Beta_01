            "question": "When coaching parents of twins or triplets, what is the 'Golden Rule' for maintaining a sustainable daily rhythm?",
            "options": [
                "Synchronizing schedules so that if one baby wakes, the other(s) are woken to feed or start their day",
                "Allowing each baby to follow their own unique biological rhythm to ensure individual needs are met",
                "Staggering sleep times by 45 minutes to give parents one-on-one time with each child",
                "Prioritizing the 'easier' sleeper's schedule and letting the 'challenging' sleeper catch up later"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Synchronization is vital for the parents' mental health and logistical management. If one multiple wakes, the other should be gently woken to keep their internal clocks and feeding cycles aligned."

            "question": "Research indicates that up to 80% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience sleep disturbances. What is a primary physiological factor identified in these cases?",
            "options": [
                "An overproduction of cortisol in the evening",
                "Irregularities in melatonin secretion and circadian rhythm signaling",
                "A complete lack of REM sleep cycles",
                "Heightened sensitivity to dietary glucose at bedtime"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children with ASD often demonstrate lower levels of melatonin metabolites and altered circadian rhythms, making sleep onset and maintenance significantly more difficult than in neurotypical peers."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client's 10-month-old develops a fever and ear infection in the middle of a sleep training plan. What is the most professional recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the plan exactly as written to maintain consistency",
                "Switch to 'extinction' (CIO) so the child can get the rest they need without interruption",
                "Pause active coaching, provide necessary comfort and medical support, and resume the plan 3–5 days after symptoms clear",
                "Stop coaching entirely and wait at least one month before trying again"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Illness requires a temporary 'pause' in behavioral expectations. Once the child is medically cleared and symptoms have subsided, the parents can return to the original plan, usually seeing a quick recovery of sleep skills."

            "question": "When traveling across multiple time zones in an eastward direction, which strategy best helps reset the child's internal clock?",
            "options": [
                "Seeking bright morning light and avoiding bright light in the late afternoon",
                "Keeping the child in a dark room until 10:00 AM local time",
                "Immediately putting the child to bed at their 'home' bedtime regardless of local time",
                "Using high doses of melatonin for the duration of the trip"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "To advance the circadian clock (eastward travel), morning light exposure is the most powerful zeitgeber (time-giver) to help the body adjust to the earlier local schedule."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "What is the primary developmental reason for delaying the crib-to-bed transition until age 3, if possible?",
            "options": [
                "Children do not have the physical strength to climb out of bed before age 3",
                "Children under 3 lack the cognitive impulse control to understand 'invisible boundaries'",
                "The risk of SIDS remains high until the third birthday",
                "Toddlers require the high sides of a crib to feel emotionally secure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before age 3, the prefrontal cortex is not sufficiently developed for most children to resist the impulse to leave an open bed. The physical boundary of the crib acts as a 'safety net' for their lack of self-regulation."

            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark clinical characteristic of a Night Terror (Sleep Terror)?",
            "options": [
                "The event usually occurs in the early morning hours during REM sleep",
                "The child is easily comforted and can describe a frightening dream",
                "The event occurs in the first third of the night during deep NREM sleep, and the child has no memory of it",
                "The child is fully awake but paralyzed and unable to speak"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Night terrors occur during the transition from deep NREM sleep to lighter sleep, typically in the first few hours of the night. Unlike nightmares, the child is not 'awake' and will not remember the event."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "For a 4-year-old who frequently leaves their room for 'one more drink' or 'one more hug' (curtain calls), which evidence-based behavioral tool is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "The Bedtime Pass",
                "Immediate Return to Bed with no eye contact",

                "Removing all toys from the room as a penalty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Bedtime Pass gives the child a sense of control and limits exits. Research shows it significantly reduces bedtime resistance by providing one 'exchange' for a request, after which no further exits are allowed."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Children with ADHD often suffer from 'Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome.' How does this typically manifest?",
            "options": [
                "Waking up at 4:00 AM every day ready to play",
                "Falling asleep instantly but waking up every 60 minutes",
                "An inability to fall asleep until much later than the desired bedtime, followed by difficulty waking in the morning",
                "Frequent sleepwalking and talking during the night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome is a circadian rhythm disorder common in ADHD where the 'sleep window' is shifted significantly later, making traditional bedtimes feel physiologically impossible for the child."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "When preparing for the 'Spring Forward' Daylight Savings transition, what is the recommended 'proactive' approach?",
            "options": [
                "Wake the child 1 hour earlier on Saturday morning",
                "Shift the entire schedule 15 minutes earlier each day for the 4 days leading up to the change",
                "Do nothing and let the child adjust cold-turkey on Sunday",
                "Keep the child awake 2 hours later on Saturday night so they sleep in"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A gradual 15-minute shift earlier over four days allows the child's internal clock to adjust incrementally, minimizing the 'jet lag' effect of the lost hour."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Future-Proofing' sleep, what does the '80/20 Rule' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "80% of sleep should be in the crib, 20% can be on-the-go",
                "80% of the time parents follow the schedule strictly, while 20% allows for life's flexibility (parties, travel, illness)",
                "80% of children will respond to training, while 20% will require medical intervention",
                "80% of the bedtime routine should be hygiene-based, 20% should be connection-based"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule emphasizes that once sleep is established, parents can be flexible 20% of the time without 'breaking' the child's sleep habits, provided they return to the 80% consistency afterward."
