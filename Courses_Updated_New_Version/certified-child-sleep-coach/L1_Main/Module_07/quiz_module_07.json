                "It has no impact on the child's sleep, only the parent's",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyper-vigilance often causes parents to intervene before a child has a chance to self-settle, which can degrade the child's independent sleep skills over time."

                "To provide the parent with a 'Sleep Toolkit' and the confidence to manage future disruptions independently",
                "To guarantee the child will never experience another sleep regression",
                "To transition the child into a different sleep training method"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of graduation is empowering parent autonomy, ensuring they have the tools and confidence to handle life's transitions without needing the coach."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During transitions like moving, consistency is key. Re-establishing the routine provides the security the child needs while maintaining sleep boundaries."

                "It significantly reduces symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety with a high effect size",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule emphasizes that perfection isn't required; a solid 80% consistency allows for the flexibility needed to handle travel, illness, and special occasions (the 20%)."
