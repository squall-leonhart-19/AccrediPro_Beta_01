            "question": "According to the Science of Habit, why is 'Intermittent Reinforcement' considered the greatest enemy of sleep training?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the child to become overly tired from lack of sleep.",
                "It creates a 'gambler's mentality' where the child persists in a behavior because the reward is unpredictable.",
                "It speeds up the extinction process too quickly, leading to caregiver burnout.",
                "It prevents the child from reaching Deep Sleep (Stage 3) cycles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful schedule of reinforcement; if a child is occasionally rewarded for crying (e.g., being picked up after 20 minutes), they learn to cry longer and harder in hopes of the next reward."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Caregiver Compact' in a multi-parent household?",
            "options": [
                "To determine which parent is 'to blame' for previous sleep failures.",
                "To legally bind the parents to the Sleep Coach's contract.",
                "To ensure both caregivers provide identical responses, preventing the child from seeking a 'weak link' in the plan.",
                "To allow one parent to sleep in a separate room for the entire duration of the training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistency across all caregivers is vital. The Caregiver Compact aligns the support team so the child receives a unified message, which accelerates the learning of new sleep associations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client notes that on Night 4, their child's crying increased significantly in intensity and duration after two nights of improvement. What is the most likely clinical explanation?",
            "options": [
                "The sleep training method has failed and must be changed.",
                "The child has developed a secondary ear infection.",
                "An 'Extinction Burst,' which is a temporary escalation of the behavior before it subsides.",
                "The child has reached a state of chronic over-tiredness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An extinction burst typically occurs between nights 3 and 5. It is a sign that the old behavior is no longer working, and the child is making one last, intense effort to elicit the old response."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "During the 'First 72 Hours' of the Implementation Schedule, what is the coach's primary role regarding the caregivers?",
            "options": [
                "To rewrite the plan every 12 hours based on feedback.",
                "To provide high-frequency emotional support and monitor for 'implementation drift.'",
                "To physically attend the sleep training at the client's home.",
                "To decrease communication to allow the parents to find their own rhythm."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first 72 hours are the most volatile. Coaches must provide high-touch support to ensure the caregivers don't deviate from the plan during the initial resistance phase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Which of the following best defines 'Standardizing Response Management'?",
            "options": [
                "Using the exact same words, tone, and physical touch for every check-in.",
                "Responding to the child immediately every time they make a sound.",
                "Alternating between different methods to see which one the child prefers.",
                "Allowing the child to cry for exactly 60 minutes before intervening."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Standardization involves removing variables. By keeping the response (words, tone, duration) identical, the caregiver becomes 'boring' and predictable, which helps the child focus on self-soothing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When using the 'Consistency Scorecard,' what is the target adherence percentage required to maintain behavioral momentum?",
            "options": [
                "50% (The 'Halfway' Mark)",
                "70% (The 'Passing' Grade)",
                "85% or higher (The 'Gold Standard')",
                "100% (The 'Perfection' Requirement)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 100% is ideal, research in behavioral coaching suggests that 85%+ adherence is the threshold required to prevent intermittent reinforcement from stalling progress."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "The '3:00 AM Fatigue Barrier' is primarily driven by which physiological factor in caregivers?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-reflexive hearing.",
                "Decision fatigue and a decline in prefrontal cortex function due to sleep deprivation.",
                "An increase in cortisol levels in the caregiver.",
                "A natural spike in adrenaline during the early morning hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep-deprived caregivers suffer from impaired executive function. At 3:00 AM, the 'logical' brain is less active, making them prone to 'giving in' to stop the crying for short-term relief."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "In the 'Pivot vs. Push' framework, which scenario justifies a 'Pivot' (pausing the plan)?",
            "options": [
                "The child is crying louder than the parent expected.",
                "The child has a confirmed fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C).",
                "The parent feels guilty and wants to stop.",
                "The child rolled onto their stomach for the first time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physical illness (fever, vomiting, respiratory distress) is a mandatory reason to pivot. Behavioral training cannot and should not be enforced when a child's physiological safety or comfort is compromised."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A family traveling across three time zones should be advised to do what regarding their sleep consistency?",
            "options": [
                "Push through the plan regardless of the time zone change.",
                "Use 'The 80/20 Rule'—maintain consistency for 80% of sleep events, but allow flexibility for 20% to manage travel stress.",
                "Stop the plan entirely and start over from Day 1 when they return.",
                "Only sleep train during the naps, but not at night while traveling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule allows for 'Managed Deviations.' It acknowledges that travel or special events happen, but as long as the core 80% remains consistent, the habit is unlikely to be fully broken."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Consistency Drift' often observed in the second week of sleep training?",
            "options": [
                "The child starts sleeping through the night perfectly.",
                "The coach stops checking in with the parents.",
                "A gradual relaxation of the rules (e.g., longer check-ins) because the parents think the 'hard part' is over.",
                "The child's circadian rhythm shifting to an earlier wake time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistency Drift occurs when initial success leads to complacency. Caregivers may start 'sneaking in' old habits, which can lead to a relapse in the child's sleep behavior."
