            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which neurochemical is primarily responsible for 'homeostatic sleep pressure,' building up in the brain the longer a child remains awake?",
            "options": ["Melatonin", "Adenosine", "Cortisol", "Serotonin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adenosine is the byproduct of energy consumption in the brain; its accumulation creates the 'drive' to sleep, whereas melatonin regulates the timing of sleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Spectrum of Tiredness' discussed in Lesson 2, which of the following is categorized as an 'Early/Subtle' cue?",
            "options": ["Tugging at ears", "Rubbing eyes and nose", "The 'Long Stare' or glazed eyes", "Arching the back"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Long Stare' or losing interest in toys are subtle early cues. Rubbing eyes and tugging ears are typically 'Late' cues, indicating the window is closing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In the 'Hunger-Fatigue Paradox,' why might an overtired 4-month-old exhibit rooting behaviors even if they were recently fed?",
            "options": ["They are experiencing a growth spurt", "Rooting acts as a primitive self-soothing reflex when the nervous system is overstimulated", "The baby has a high metabolic rate requiring hourly feeds", "It is a sign of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Overtired infants often resort to primitive reflexes like rooting or sucking on hands as a way to self-regulate and soothe a taxed nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "What physiological process occurs when a child misses their 'Optimal Sleep Window,' leading to the phenomenon known as the 'Second Wind'?",
            "options": ["The Glymphatic system shuts down", "The body releases a surge of Melatonin to compensate", "The HPA axis triggers the release of Cortisol and Adrenaline", "The brain enters a state of 'Hyper-REM'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When the sleep window is missed, the body perceives staying awake as a stressor, triggering the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis to release stimulating hormones like cortisol."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A 9-month-old who is learning to pull to stand appears hyperactive and energetic 3 hours into their wake window, despite usually napping at 2.5 hours. This is an example of:",
            "options": ["A permanent drop in sleep needs", "Cue Masking due to developmental milestones", "The 'Forbidden Zone' of circadian rhythm", "An 'Easy' temperament profile"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Major motor milestones create a 'drive to practice' that can mask traditional tired cues with physical exertion and dopamine-driven excitement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which temperament type is most likely to move from 'perfectly fine' to 'hysterical' with almost no visible transition cues?",
            "options": ["The 'Slow-to-Warm' child", "The 'Easy/Flexible' child", "The 'Spirited/Hypersensitive' child", "The 'Sensory Seeker'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spirited or hypersensitive children often have a very narrow 'optimal window' and can transition from calm to overstimulated rapidly, making their cues difficult to catch."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "When coaching parents on 'Wake Windows,' what is the most scientifically accurate way to describe their function?",
            "options": ["Fixed biological laws that must be followed to the minute", "Predictive averages based on typical adenosine accumulation rates", "Marketing terms used to sell sleep schedules", "Calculations based solely on the child's weight"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wake windows are predictive tools that estimate how long a child's brain can manage adenosine levels before the nervous system becomes overtaxed."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A client's 6-month-old is arching their back, turning away from the bottle, and letting out high-pitched screams. Based on Lesson 2 and 3, what is the most likely state of this child?",
            "options": ["Early Tiredness", "Active Hunger", "Overtired/Cortisol Spike", "Boredom"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arching the back, turning away from food, and frantic vocalizations are classic signs of the 'Overtired Zone' where the child is struggling to self-regulate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "How should a coach advise a parent who is strictly following a clock-based schedule but finding the baby takes 30 minutes to fall asleep and cries throughout?",
            "options": ["Tell them to wait longer so the baby is 'more tired'", "Suggest shifting from 'Clock-Watching' to 'Cue-Connection' to find a more accurate window", "Advise them to use 'Cry It Out' to enforce the schedule", "Recommend increasing the room temperature"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a baby struggles significantly to fall asleep on a fixed schedule, the schedule likely doesn't align with their biological needs; observing cues helps find the 'sweet spot'."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "In sensory processing, a 'Sensory Avoider' may show tired cues that look like:",
            "options": ["Banging their head against the crib", "Increased vocalization and shouting", "Turning their head away from lights and sounds (Gaze Aversion)", "Aggressively seeking physical touch"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory avoiders often use 'Gaze Aversion' or turning away as a primary tired cue to reduce environmental input when their brain is ready for sleep."
