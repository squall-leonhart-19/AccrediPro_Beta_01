            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 1 indicates that 40-80% of neurodivergent children (specifically those with ASD) experience sleep disturbances. What is a primary biological driver for this?",
            "options": [
                "Hypersensitivity to white noise frequencies",
                "Delayed or insufficient nocturnal melatonin secretion",
                "Excessive production of adenosine in the morning",
                "Strict adherence to rigid daytime routines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show that children with ASD often have altered circadian rhythms and lower levels of melatonin metabolites, making sleep onset and maintenance biologically more difficult."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "For a child with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) who is categorized as a 'Sensory Seeker,' which environmental modification is most effective for layout optimization?",
            "options": [
                "Removing all wall decor to minimize visual stimuli",
                "Using a high-pitched white noise machine",
                "Providing proprioceptive input through snug-fitting pajamas or weighted sleep sacks (if age-appropriate)",
                "Installing a bright nightlight to prevent fear of the dark"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory seekers often require proprioceptive input (deep pressure) to calm their nervous systems and prepare for sleep, whereas sensory avoiders would require the removal of stimuli."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the 'Forbidden Zone' is described as a critical chronobiological concept. What does this term refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The 2-hour window after midnight where deep sleep is most intense",
                "The period of high alertness driven by the circadian system just before biological sleep onset",
                "The time between 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM when the body temperature is lowest",
                "The transition period between Nap 1 and Nap 2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Forbidden Zone' is a period of maximum circadian wake-drive that occurs shortly before the body begins secreting melatonin, often causing a 'second wind' if bedtime is timed incorrectly."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "When applying the S.L.U.M.B.E.R. Method™ to a child with a 'Spirited' temperament, why is the 'Chair Method' (Gradual Withdrawal) often preferred over 'Check and Console'?",
            "options": [
                "Spirited children have lower IQs and need more help",
                "Spirited children often have higher sensory arousal, and frequent entries/exits can cause overstimulation and frustration",
                "The Chair Method is faster for spirited children",
                "Spirited children do not experience separation anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spirited children often react intensely to the intermittent reinforcement of 'Check and Console.' Staying in the room (Gradual Withdrawal) provides the coregulation they need without the 'start-stop' frustration of intermittent checks."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "In complex family structures (Lesson 5), such as co-parenting households, what is the 'Non-Negotiable' for behavioral consistency?",
            "options": [
                "The child must sleep in the exact same brand of crib in both homes",
                "Both households must use the exact same white noise track",
                "A 'Unified Sleep Plan' that aligns response techniques and schedule anchors across both environments",
                "The child should only sleep train at the primary residence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While environment details can vary slightly, the response technique (how a parent reacts to a wake-up) and schedule anchors must be consistent to prevent 'splitting' and confusion for the child."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "A 15-month-old client is experiencing 'Split Nights' (awake for 2 hours in the middle of the night, but happy). Based on Lesson 6, what is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "Night terrors requiring medical intervention",
                "Overtiredness causing a cortisol spike",
                "Insufficient sleep pressure due to a total sleep duration that exceeds the child's biological needs",
                "A sudden surge in separation anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Split nights are typically a 'sleep pressure' issue. If a child spends too much time in bed or has naps that are too long, the body 'borrows' sleep from the middle of the night because the drive to sleep is gone."

        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "What is the recommended 'Sleep Pressure' adjustment for a child who is a chronic early riser (5:00 AM) but is otherwise well-rested?",
            "options": [
                "Moving bedtime 30 minutes earlier to catch the 'sleep wave'",
                "Increasing daytime nap length to 3 hours",
                "Gradually shifting the entire schedule (including meals and light exposure) later by 15-minute increments",
                "Eliminating all naps immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic early rising that is not due to overtiredness usually requires shifting the circadian anchors (light, food, activity) later to reset the internal clock."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is the '3-Day Rule' regarding illness and sleep training?",
            "options": [
                "You must wait 3 days after a fever breaks before returning to the sleep plan",
                "It takes 3 days for a child to forget their sleep training during an illness",
                "You should only offer comfort for the first 3 days of a cold",
                "A child will recover from any regression in exactly 3 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The '3-Day Rule' suggests waiting approximately 72 hours after the resolution of acute symptoms (like fever or vomiting) before re-implementing formal boundaries to ensure the child is physically ready."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Red Flag' requiring an immediate referral to a medical professional rather than a sleep coaching intervention?",
            "options": [
                "A child crying for 20 minutes during sleep training",
                "A child who consistently wakes up at 6:00 AM",
                "Audible snoring, mouth breathing, or labored breathing during sleep",
                "A child who refuses to eat broccoli"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Snoring and mouth breathing are symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which is a medical condition that can make sleep training dangerous or ineffective until treated."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses the link between Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) in children and nutritional markers. Which lab value is most relevant to RLS and 'growing pains'?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C levels",
                "Serum Ferritin (Iron stores)",

                "Calcium-to-Magnesium ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low serum ferritin levels (below 50 ng/mL) are strongly associated with Restless Leg Syndrome and periodic limb movements in children, which can cause frequent, 'unexplained' night wakings."
