            "question": "On the Methodology Spectrum, which approach is categorized as having the highest level of parental support and the lowest level of 'directness'?",
            "options": [
                "Modified Extinction",
                "Spaced Soothing",
                "Gradual Withdrawal (The Chair Method)",
                "Full Extinction (CIO)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gradual Withdrawal sits at the high-support end of the spectrum because the parent remains physically present in the room, slowly reducing their proximity over several nights."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to temperament-based selection, why might a 'Feisty' or highly persistent child struggle with frequent interval check-ins?",
            "options": [
                "They lack object permanence.",
                "The intermittent presence of the parent acts as 'intermittent reinforcement' and can increase frustration.",
                "They require more physical touch than other temperaments.",
                "They have lower sleep pressure than easy-going children."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For highly persistent children, brief check-ins often serve to 'reset' their protest or provide just enough stimulation to keep them awake, leading to increased frustration rather than soothing."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "When assessing Parental Capacity, what is the primary risk of recommending a high-engagement method like Pick-Up-Put-Down (PUPD) to a parent with 'Critically Low' capacity?",
            "options": [
                "The method works too quickly for the parent to adjust.",
                "The parent may lack the physical and emotional stamina to remain consistent through multiple hours of intervention.",
                "The child will develop an insecure attachment.",
                "High-engagement methods require no parental consistency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PUPD is physically demanding and can take hours in the initial nights. Parents with critically low capacity (due to exhaustion or mental health) are at high risk of 'giving in' mid-process, which confuses the child."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In the Pick-Up-Put-Down (PUPD) method, what is the 'Golden Rule' for when to return the child to the crib?",
            "options": [
                "Once the child has fallen completely asleep in your arms.",
                "After exactly 5 minutes of holding.",
                "The moment the child stops crying/struggling, but is still awake.",
                "Only after the child has started to yawn."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal of PUPD is to soothe the 'peak' of the cry but ensure the child is placed back in the crib awake so they can complete the final step of falling asleep independently."

            "id": "q4_5",

            "options": [
                "Stays for at least 15 minutes to ensure the child is calm.",
                "Keeps the check-in brief (1-2 minutes) and avoids picking the child up.",
                "Feeds the child a small 'top-up' snack.",
                "Closes the door and does not return until morning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interval check-ins are designed to reassure the child of the parent's presence without taking over the job of falling asleep; long check-ins or picking up can interfere with the learning process."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "What is an 'Extinction Burst' as described in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden improvement in sleep on the first night.",
                "A temporary, intense increase in the frequency or intensity of crying just before the behavior disappears.",
                "The point where a child learns to climb out of the crib.",
                "A physiological reaction to over-tiredness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An extinction burst typically occurs around night 3-5 of a direct method, where the child 'protests' one last time with high intensity before the new sleep habit is consolidated."

                "Using a 'Silent Return' or 'Gate/Door' strategy to manage room exits.",
                "Reducing the wake window to 2 hours.",
                "Eliminating the nap immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Toddlers have the mobility to leave the room, so the methodology must include a plan for physical boundaries, such as a toddler gate or the 'Silent Return' to the bed."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "The 'Selection Protocol' Decision Matrix suggests that if a parent's philosophy is 'Direct/Efficiency-Oriented' and the child has a 'Resilient' temperament, the best fit is likely:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When both parental philosophy and child temperament align toward efficiency and resilience, direct methods like extinction are often the fastest and most successful path."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Chair Method allows the child to see the parent (reassurance) without the overstimulation of physical touch that this specific child finds distressing."

            "id": "q4_10",

            "options": [
                "10-14 days slower than gentle methods.",
                "3-5 days faster than gentle methods.",
                "Only if the child is over 18 months old.",
                "With higher rates of parental cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses show that direct methods tend to resolve sleep onset associations 3-5 days faster because they provide a clearer, more consistent boundary for the child from the start."
