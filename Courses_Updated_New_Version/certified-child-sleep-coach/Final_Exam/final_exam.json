            "options": [
                "To determine the specific sleep training technique to be used immediately.",
                "A comprehensive evaluation of current sleep patterns, family dynamics, and developmental milestones.",
                "To reorganize the nursery furniture for better airflow.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Situational Assessment is the foundational step where the coach gathers data on the child's history, the family's lifestyle, and any developmental factors that might influence sleep before any changes are made."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that a cooler room, specifically between 68-72°F, is optimal for infant sleep as it prevents overheating and aligns with the body's natural drop in core temperature during sleep."

        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During the 'U' (Understanding Cues) phase, a coach identifies that a 5-month-old is exhibiting 'late cues.' Which of the following is considered a late cue indicating the child is already overtired?",

                "Glazed eyes and staring into space",
                "Turning away from stimulation",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arching the back, stiffening the body, and inconsolable crying are signs of a cortisol surge, indicating the child has moved past their optimal sleep window and is now overtired."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Chair Method (Gradual Withdrawal) allows for parental presence and support, which is often preferred by families seeking a more gradual approach or for children with high-sensitivity temperaments."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "In Module 5 (Behavioral Consistency), the term 'Extinction Burst' refers to:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An extinction burst is a common psychological phenomenon where the undesired behavior (crying for help) spikes as the child tests the new boundaries before finally accepting the new routine."

        {
            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "During 'E' (Evaluation & Refinement), a coach notices a 'split night' in the sleep logs (where the child is awake and happy for 1-2 hours in the middle of the night). What is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "The child is hungry and needs a night feed.",
                "The child has too much 'sleep pressure' from being overtired.",

                "The room is too dark, causing sensory deprivation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Split nights usually occur when the 'Sleep Pressure' (Process S) is too low, often caused by excessive daytime sleep or a bedtime that is not aligned with the child's circadian rhythm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule is a maintenance strategy that allows for flexibility (20% of the time) while ensuring the core sleep habits remain consistent (80% of the time) to prevent regressions."

        {
            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "According to the AAP 2022 Safe Sleep Guidelines, which of the following is a requirement for a safe sleep surface?",
            "options": [
                "A firm, flat, non-inclined surface covered by a fitted sheet.",
                "A soft mattress with a slight incline for reflux.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 2022 AAP update emphasizes that surfaces must be flat (not inclined) and firm to prevent suffocation and positional asphyxia."

                "Whenever the child asks for a 'big kid bed'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Waiting until age 3 is recommended because toddlers under 3 often lack the cognitive impulse control to stay in a bed without the physical boundaries of a crib."

            "id": "final_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Process C is the Circadian Rhythm, which is the internal clock influenced by light and dark. Process S is the Homeostatic Sleep Drive (pressure)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must stay within their scope of practice. Snoring and gasping are medical red flags that require a referral to a medical professional."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extensive research, including longitudinal studies, shows that behavioral sleep interventions (BSIs) are effective and do not harm the parent-child bond or the child's emotional health."

            "id": "final_15",

                "The coach checks in with the family every two days."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement is the strongest way to cement a behavior. If a parent occasionally reverts to old habits, the child learns that if they cry long enough, they might eventually get the reward, making the habit harder to break."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep-onset associations (props) are the 'bridge' to sleep. If a child cannot fall asleep independently, they will be unable to transition between sleep cycles at night without the same help."
