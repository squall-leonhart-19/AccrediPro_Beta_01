            "question": "During the 'Deep-Dive Intake' (L1), why is it critical to assess 'Parental Self-Efficacy' alongside infant sleep data?",
            "options": [
                "To determine if the parents can afford premium coaching packages",
                "Because high self-efficacy is correlated with higher consistency and better long-term sleep outcomes",
                "To decide which parent should be the primary point of contact",
                "To document parental failures for the final report"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parental self-efficacy—the belief in one's ability to implement change—is a primary predictor of intervention fidelity. Coaches must assess this to tailor the complexity of the roadmap."

        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In 'Sensory-Inclusive Layout Optimization' (L2), how does 'Proprioceptive Input' assist in the sleep transition for sensory-seeking children?",
            "options": [
                "It increases cortisol levels to keep the child alert during the routine",
                "It provides 'heavy work' for the joints and muscles, triggering the release of serotonin and calming the nervous system",
                "It eliminates the need for a white noise machine by improving internal focus",
                "It speeds up the vestibular system to induce dizziness and sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input (like firm pressure or 'heavy work') helps organize the nervous system, making it easier for sensory-seeking or high-needs children to transition into a parasympathetic state for sleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to 'Biological Synchronization' (L3), what is the 'Forbidden Zone' (Wake Maintenance Zone)?",
            "options": [
                "The period between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM when growth hormone peaks",
                "A 1–2 hour window before biological sleep onset where the body's alerting signal is at its strongest",
                "The time immediately following a nap when sleep inertia is highest",
                "The transition period between the third and fourth sleep cycles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Forbidden Zone' is a period of high alertness just before the biological sleep window opens. Attempting to put a child to sleep during this time often results in significant resistance and 'second winds'."

        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "When applying 'Methodology Selection' (L4), which temperament trait is most likely to experience 'over-stimulation' from parental presence (e.g., The Chair Method)?",
            "options": [
                "Low Intensity / High Adaptability",
                "High Intensity / Low Adaptability (The 'Feisty' child)",
                "High Regularity / High Approach",
                "Low Sensitivity / High Distractibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-intensity, low-adaptability children often find parental presence without intervention (staying in the room but not helping) more frustrating and stimulating than a more hands-off approach."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "In 'Behavioral Architecture' (L5), what is the primary function of 'Sleep Scaffolding'?",
            "options": [
                "Building a physical structure around the crib to block light",
                "Providing temporary support that is gradually removed as the child develops independent self-regulation skills",
                "Using multiple sleep associations simultaneously to ensure sleep occurs",
                "Strictly adhering to a clock-based schedule regardless of cues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding is a developmental concept where the coach provides the 'framework' for success (support) and slowly withdraws it as the child's 'internal architecture' (skills) takes over."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "Under 'Data-Driven Evaluation' (L6), what is the recommended 'wait time' for a consistent behavioral intervention before making a strategic pivot?",
            "options": [
                "12–24 hours",
                "24–48 hours",
                "72–96 hours",
                "14 consecutive days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that 72–96 hours (3–4 nights) is typically required to see an initial shift in behavioral patterns. Pivoting too early prevents the child from learning the new boundary."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "In 'Restorative Maintenance' (L7), the '2-Week Rule' for developmental leaps suggests that:",
            "options": [
                "Parents should stop all sleep training for 2 weeks during a leap",
                "Sleep disturbances lasting longer than 2 weeks are likely due to a new habit rather than the leap itself",
                "Children take exactly 2 weeks to master a new gross motor skill",
                "The coach should check in every 2 weeks for the first year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2-Week Rule helps parents distinguish between a temporary 'regression' caused by a developmental leap and a permanent shift in sleep hygiene or habits that needs adjustment."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "A 'Professional Deliverable' (L8) must include 'Contingency Protocols.' What does this specifically address?",
            "options": [
                "The coach's refund policy",
                "Step-by-step instructions for 'what to do when things go wrong' (illness, travel, or teething)",
                "A list of recommended sleep products with affiliate links",
                "The legal disclaimer for the coaching practice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Contingency protocols future-proof the plan by giving parents the tools to handle common disruptions without losing the progress they've made."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A case study in L2 describes a child who is highly sensitive to 'Auditory Clutter.' Which environmental adjustment is most scientifically sound?",
            "options": [
                "Total silence in the nursery",
                "A continuous, low-frequency 'pink noise' at 50-60 decibels to mask environmental spikes",
                "Playing classical music throughout the night",
                "Using a baby monitor with high-volume feedback"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pink noise (which has more power at lower frequencies) is often superior to white noise for masking disruptive environmental sounds while remaining soothing to the infant's auditory system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "When evaluating 'Biological Synchronization' (L3), which of the following is considered a 'Late-Stage' sleep cue indicating the child is likely overtired?",
            "options": [
                "Staring into space / 'Glazed' eyes",
                "Decreased physical activity",
                "Physical hyperactivity, frantic movements, or inconsolable crying",
                "A single yawn"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyperactivity and 'second winds' are late-stage cues caused by a cortisol surge, indicating the optimal biological window has been missed and the child is now overtired."
