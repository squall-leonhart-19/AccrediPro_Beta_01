            "question": "Which of the following symptoms is considered a 'Hard Red Flag' that requires an immediate referral to a medical specialist before proceeding with behavioral sleep coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Bedtime resistance lasting more than 45 minutes",
                "Audible gasping, choking, or long pauses in breathing during sleep",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Audible gasping, choking, or pauses in breathing are clinical indicators of Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSA) and require medical evaluation by a pulmonologist or ENT."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high, narrow arched palate often correlates with narrow nasal passages and restricted airways, which can lead to sleep-disordered breathing."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that individuals with ASD often have lower levels of melatonin or irregular secretion patterns, contributing to significant difficulties falling asleep."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic sleep fragmentation lasting 4-6 weeks is often the tipping point where parental burnout transitions from 'tiredness' into a cognitive and emotional crisis."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "When working with adopted or foster children (L5), why is the 'Modified Chair Method' generally preferred over 'Extinction' (Cry It Out)?",
            "options": [
                "It is faster than extinction for trauma-affected children",
                "It requires less effort from the parents",
                "It maintains the 'felt safety' and proximity required to prevent triggering attachment-based trauma",
                "Adopted children do not respond to extinction due to genetics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed coaching prioritizes 'felt safety.' Methods that involve total withdrawal of the caregiver can re-traumatize children with history of abandonment or neglect."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A 'Failed' Sleep Plan (L6) is often the result of a 'Biological Mismatch.' What does this term specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The child is too young for the chosen method",
                "Attempting to force a sleep schedule that conflicts with the child's natural circadian rhythm or 'sleep pressure' needs",

                "Using a sound machine that is too quiet for the room size"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological mismatch occurs when a coach sets a bedtime or nap schedule that does not align with the child's internal clock, leading to chronic resistance and 'failed' interventions."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In cases of multiples (twins/triplets) where one infant is 'medically fragile,' what is the recommended approach for synchronized scheduling?",
            "options": [
                "Always wake the healthy twin when the fragile twin wakes",
                "Prioritize the medical needs and feeding requirements of the fragile infant as the 'anchor' for the household schedule",
                "Keep the infants in separate houses to ensure one sleeps well",
                "Ignore the fragile infant's cues to keep the healthy twin on schedule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases involving medical fragility, the medical requirements (medications, specialized feedings) must serve as the anchor for the family's logistical planning."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which sensory profile (L3) would most likely benefit from 'heavy work' or proprioceptive input (like a firm swaddle or weighted blanket) before sleep?",
            "options": [
                "Sensory Avoidant (Hypersensitive)",
                "Sensory Seeking (Hyposensitive)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory seekers often need extra proprioceptive input (deep pressure) to calm their nervous systems and prepare for sleep."

            "question": "What is the 'Rule of Three' when troubleshooting a plan that has stalled for more than 72 hours?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Troubleshooting high-risk cases requires looking at the three pillars: timing (circadian), environment (sensory/medical), and the behavioral response (consistency)."

            "options": [
                "To ensure the child never cries again",
                "To achieve a 13-hour night every night",
                "To establish a 'Relapse Prevention Plan' that identifies early warning signs of sleep regression",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintenance for complex cases focuses on preventing a return to crisis by helping parents identify early triggers (illness, travel, developmental leaps) and responding proactively."
