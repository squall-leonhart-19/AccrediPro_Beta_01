            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Coaching (L1), what does the 'Window of Tolerance' represent for a child during sleep training?",
            "options": [
                "The specific 15-minute window when melatonin is at its highest peak.",
                "The physiological state where the child can process emotions and learn new sleep associations without being overwhelmed.",
                "The time frame between the first yawn and the onset of the cortisol spike.",
                "The duration a parent is allowed to leave the room before returning to provide comfort."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is a trauma-informed concept describing the optimal zone of 'arousal' where a child can integrate experience and learn. Outside this window (hyper- or hypo-arousal), the brain's ability to learn new habits is compromised."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "Research cited in L2 indicates that what percentage of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience significant sleep disturbances?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-25%",
                "Approximately 30-45%",
                "Approximately 50-80%",
                "Nearly 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that 50% to 80% of children with ASD struggle with sleep, often due to circadian rhythm irregularities, sensory sensitivities, or lower endogenous melatonin production."

        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Clinical Red Flag' (L3) that requires an immediate referral to a medical professional rather than behavioral coaching?",
            "options": [
                "A child who cries for more than 20 minutes during the initial 'put down'.",
                "A child who exhibits 'paradoxical sweating' and frequent gasping or snoring during sleep.",
                "A child who refuses to sleep in a crib and prefers a floor mattress.",
                "A child who has a consistent early morning wake time of 5:30 AM."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gasping, snoring, and excessive sweating (paradoxical sweating) are hallmark symptoms of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) or Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which are medical conditions beyond the scope of a sleep coach."

        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "When working with 'Spirited' or high-intensity children (L4), why is a 'Hybrid Methodology' often more effective than standard 'Cry It Out' (CIO)?",
            "options": [
                "Spirited children have lower cortisol levels and need more stimulation to sleep.",
                "Standard extinction can lead to 'escalation loops' in high-intensity temperaments, whereas hybrid methods manage the child's sensory threshold.",
                "Hybrid methods are always faster than extinction for every child.",
                "Spirited children do not have a homeostatic sleep drive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spirited children often possess a 'persistent' temperament. Traditional extinction can lead to extreme physiological escalation; hybrid methods allow for 'titrated' independence that keeps the child within a manageable arousal state."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In Quantitative Sleep Analysis (L5), how is Sleep Efficiency (SE) calculated?",
            "options": [
                "Total Sleep Time divided by Total Time in Bed, multiplied by 100.",
                "Total Time in Bed minus Total Wake Time.",
                "Number of Night Wakings divided by Age in Months.",
                "Total Sleep Time divided by 24 hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency (SE) is the ratio of total sleep time to the total time spent in bed. A Master Practitioner uses this to determine if a child's sleep schedule is too 'inflated' (spending too much time in bed awake)."

        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "According to L6, 'Intermittent Reinforcement' is a primary cause of sleep training failure. Which scenario best describes this?",
            "options": [
                "The parent consistently responds to every cry within 5 minutes.",
                "The parent uses a white noise machine only during the first half of the night.",
                "The parent holds the boundary for three nights but gives in and brings the child to bed on the fourth night.",
                "The parent switches from a 2-nap to a 1-nap schedule."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement occurs when a behavior is rewarded only sometimes. This makes the behavior (crying for parental presence) much harder to extinguish because the child learns that if they persist long enough, they might eventually get the reward."

        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "Under Master Practitioner Ethics (L7), what is the 'Scope of Practice' boundary regarding supplements like Melatonin or Magnesium?",
            "options": [
                "Coaches can recommend specific dosages based on the child's weight.",
                "Coaches can recommend brands but not dosages.",
                "Coaches must never recommend supplements and should direct all medical/supplement questions to the child's pediatrician.",
                "Coaches can recommend supplements only if the parent signs a waiver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prescribing or even 'strongly suggesting' specific supplements and dosages is a clinical act. A sleep coach's role is to provide behavioral education and refer all supplement-related inquiries to a qualified medical professional."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "When managing the 2-year-old sleep regression (L8), what is a key 'Restorative Maintenance' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately reverting to a two-nap schedule to combat overtiredness.",
                "Introducing a 'Toddler Clock' and reinforcing cognitive boundaries through 'The Bedtime Pass'.",
                "Removing the midday nap entirely to increase sleep pressure.",
                "Moving the child to a 'Big Kid Bed' immediately to stop crib-climbing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2-year regression is often driven by a surge in independence and cognitive development. Using tools like toddler clocks and 'Bedtime Passes' provides the clear, visual boundaries that toddlers need to feel secure and remain consistent."

        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "For a 'Sensory Seeking' child (L2), which environmental adjustment provides the 'Heavy Work' or proprioceptive input they may need to settle?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the volume of the white noise to 85 decibels.",
                "Using a high-contrast mobile above the crib.",
                "Safe use of snug-fitting sleep sacks or 'heavy' cotton bedding (age-appropriate) to provide pressure.",
                "Leaving a bright nightlight on throughout the night."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory seekers often struggle to 'find' their body in space. Proprioceptive input, such as the pressure from a snug (but safe) sleep sack, helps calm their nervous system and signals the body to rest."

        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "In the 'Psychology of Consistency' (L6), what is 'Decision Fatigue' and how does it affect the coaching outcome?",
            "options": [
                "The child becomes too tired to decide which stuffed animal to sleep with.",
                "The coach becomes tired of analyzing sleep logs.",
                "The parent's willpower is depleted by making constant choices, leading them to take the 'path of least resistance' at 2:00 AM.",
                "The exhaustion felt by a child when they have too many nap options."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Decision fatigue is a psychological phenomenon where the quality of decisions declines after a long period of decision-making. For sleep-deprived parents, this often leads to 'giving in' during the middle of the night, which reinforces the very habits they are trying to change."
