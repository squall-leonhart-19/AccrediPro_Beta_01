            "question": "In the Holistic SLUMBER Framework™, what does the 'S' component specifically require the coach to evaluate?",
            "options": [
                "Sleep hygiene and room temperature",
                "Sensory processing and environmental reactivity",
                "Scheduling and wake window precision",
                "Social-emotional development milestones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' in the SLUMBER Framework stands for Sensory, requiring coaches to evaluate a child's sensory profile (hypo- or hyper-reactivity) to ensure the sleep environment and routine meet their neurological needs."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "When managing 'Sibling Synchronicity' in a shared bedroom, what is the recommended time buffer for staggered bedtimes to prevent 'wake-chaining'?",
            "options": [

                "20-30 minutes",
                "At least 60 minutes",
                "Bedtimes should never be staggered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 20-30 minute stagger allows the first child to reach a deeper stage of sleep (N3) before the second child enters the room, minimizing the risk of the 'wake-chaining' effect."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that between 50% and 80% of children with ASD suffer from sleep issues, often related to melatonin production irregularities and sensory processing challenges."

                "Overtiredness caused by a single missed nap"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A False Plateau occurs when progress stalls because parents, often exhausted, begin intermittently reinforcing old sleep associations, which strengthens the unwanted behavior."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "According to the Medical Liaison protocols, what is the 'Clinical Gold Standard' ferritin level for children experiencing restless sleep or RLS symptoms?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges go lower, pediatric sleep specialists generally recommend ferritin levels be above 50 ng/mL to support optimal sleep and reduce Restless Leg Syndrome symptoms."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "Which psychological phenomenon explains why a parent might stop following a sleep plan even when it is working?",

                "Extinction Burst"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parental Burnout and Decision Fatigue can lead to 'ego depletion,' where the parent no longer has the mental energy to maintain consistency, even if they see the plan is effective."

                "The parent reaching 10,000 steps per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A sustained drop in HRV and an increase in RHR are physiological indicators of high stress and poor recovery, signaling that the parent may lack the resilience to implement complex behavioral changes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The roadmap is designed to move the family from 'supported success' to 'independent mastery,' giving them the tools to handle illness, travel, and developmental leaps without a coach."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gasping, snoring, and paradoxical breathing are clinical indicators of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which is a medical condition outside the scope of behavioral coaching."
