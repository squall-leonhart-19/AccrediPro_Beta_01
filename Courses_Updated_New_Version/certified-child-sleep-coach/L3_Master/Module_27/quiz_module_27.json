            "question": "Research indicates that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often face unique biological sleep challenges. Which of the following is a primary physiological factor identified in these children?",
            "options": [
                "Lower nocturnal melatonin secretion and irregular circadian rhythms",
                "Excessive production of cortisol during the evening hours",
                "Hyperactive REM sleep cycles leading to frequent nightmares",
                "An inability to process Vitamin D, affecting sleep-wake cycles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that many children with ASD have lower levels of melatonin metabolites in their urine and a flattened circadian rhythm, making exogenous melatonin and strict environmental cues highly effective."

            "question": "When coaching parents of multiples (twins or triplets), what is the 'Golden Rule' for maintaining a manageable household schedule?",
            "options": [
                "Always follow the 'natural' rhythm of each individual baby independently",
                "If one baby wakes to eat or start the day, wake the other(s) within 15–30 minutes",
                "Keep multiples in separate rooms from birth to prevent sleep associations",
                "Stagger nap times by at least one hour to give the parent one-on-one time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synchronizing the schedule is vital for the parents' mental health and consistency. Waking the 'sleeping' twin shortly after the first wakes ensures their biological clocks stay aligned."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "A 4-year-old client exhibits frequent snoring, heavy mouth breathing, and occasional gasping sounds during sleep. As a sleep coach, what is your first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest a weighted blanket to reduce restlessness",
                "Implement a strict 'no-screen' policy two hours before bed",
                "Immediate referral to a Pediatric ENT or Sleep Specialist to rule out Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)",
                "Recommend an elimination diet to check for hidden food allergies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Snoring and gasping are red flags for Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB). Behavioral sleep coaching should not proceed until a medical professional clears the child of OSA, as coaching cannot fix a physical airway obstruction."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In trauma-informed coaching for adoptive or foster families, why is 'Cry-It-Out' (unmodified extinction) generally contraindicated?",
            "options": [
                "It is too physically demanding for the foster parents",
                "Adopted children have a higher threshold for cortisol and won't respond to it",
                "It can trigger 'Internal Working Model' threats and exacerbate attachment insecurity or trauma",
                "Foster children are legally required to be co-slept with for the first six months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children with a history of trauma or foster care placement need to establish felt safety. Methods that involve prolonged separation without parental presence can be re-traumatizing and damage the developing attachment bond."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "When traveling across multiple time zones, which direction is typically more difficult for a child's circadian rhythm to adjust to, and why?",
            "options": [
                "Traveling West, because it 'shortens' the day",
                "Traveling East, because it requires 'advancing' the internal clock (shortening the day)",
                "Traveling West, because the body cannot handle 'losing' hours",
                "Traveling North to South, because of the change in altitude"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traveling East is harder because it is easier for the human body to stay up later (delay) than it is to go to sleep earlier (advance). The body's natural rhythm is slightly longer than 24 hours."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "For a child with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) who is 'sensory seeking,' which environmental modification is most likely to improve sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "A bright nightlight with rotating colors to provide visual stimulation",
                "Proprioceptive input, such as a weighted blanket or compression sheets (with safety age-compliance)",
                "Total silence with no background noise whatsoever",
                "Synthetic polyester pajamas to provide high-texture skin contact"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input (deep pressure) helps calm the nervous system of sensory seekers by increasing serotonin and facilitating the transition into a parasympathetic state."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "In a shift-working household where a parent returns home at 3:00 AM, what is the best strategy to prevent the child's sleep from being disrupted?",
            "options": [
                "The shift-working parent should immediately wake the child for a brief 'reconnection' time",
                "The child should be moved to the living room for the second half of the night",
                "The use of high-quality white noise and 'blackout' curtains to mask the sounds of the parent returning",
                "The child should be kept on a nocturnal schedule to match the parent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environmental management (white noise and blackout) is essential in shift-working homes to protect the child's consolidated sleep from the 'secondhand' noise and light of the parent's schedule."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "Which of the following characteristics distinguishes a Night Terror (Sleep Terror) from a Nightmare?",
            "options": [
                "Night terrors occur during REM sleep; nightmares occur during N3",
                "The child can usually recall the details of a nightmare, but has no memory of a night terror",
                "Night terrors happen in the morning; nightmares happen in the first 3 hours of sleep",
                "You should always wake a child during a night terror to comfort them"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Night terrors are a parasomnia occurring in N3 (deep) sleep. The child is not fully awake, and because the brain is in a deep sleep state, there is no memory of the event the next morning."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A client's infant has been diagnosed with Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER). What is the standard pediatric recommendation for sleep positioning to reduce the risk of SIDS while managing reflux?",
            "options": [
                "Always flat on the back (supine) on a firm, flat surface",
                "Propped up at a 45-degree angle using a wedge",
                "Sleeping in a car seat or swing to maintain an upright position",
                "Sleeping on the left side (lateral) to aid digestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Despite the reflux, the AAP and other health bodies emphasize that 'Back is Best.' Wedges and inclines are not recommended due to the risk of the infant sliding down and compromising their airway."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "For children with ADHD, 'Bedtime Resistance' is often linked to 'Temporal Myopia.' What does this mean for your coaching strategy?",
            "options": [
                "The child cannot see objects clearly at night",
                "The child has difficulty perceiving the passage of time and needs visual timers and 'now/next' cues",
                "The child is biologically incapable of sleeping before midnight",
                "The child requires high-intensity exercise immediately before getting into bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Temporal Myopia refers to 'time blindness.' Children with ADHD struggle to understand how much time they have left before bed, making transitions difficult. Visual schedules and countdowns are essential interventions."
