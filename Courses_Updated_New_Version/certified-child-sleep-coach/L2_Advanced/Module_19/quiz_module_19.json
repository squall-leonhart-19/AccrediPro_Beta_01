            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "According to the landmark 2006 American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) review by Mindell et al., what percentage of the 52 reviewed studies reported that Behavioral Sleep Interventions (BSIs) were effective in reducing bedtime resistance and night wakings?",
            "options": ["72%", "85%", "94%", "100%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Mindell et al. (2006) review found that 94% of studies demonstrated significant clinical improvements in pediatric sleep following behavioral interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Triple Risk Model' for SIDS, which of the following represents the 'Critical Developmental Period'?",
            "options": ["The first 24 hours after birth", "The window between 2 and 4 months of age", "The transition from liquid to solid foods", "The onset of independent crawling"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Critical Developmental Period refers to the first 6 months of life, with a peak vulnerability window between 2 and 4 months when homeostatic controls are undergoing rapid maturation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "The Price et al. (2012) five-year follow-up study, which evaluated the long-term effects of behavioral sleep techniques, found what result regarding the parent-child bond?",
            "options": ["A significant increase in avoidant attachment styles", "No significant differences in emotional development or attachment between intervention and control groups", "Improved maternal mental health but decreased infant security", "Significant delays in executive function among the intervention group"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study concluded that behavioral sleep interventions in infancy have no long-term adverse effects on child neurodevelopment, mental health, or the parent-child relationship at age 6."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Which neurobiological transition occurs around 3 to 4 months of age that fundamentally changes infant sleep architecture?",
            "options": ["The total disappearance of REM sleep", "The emergence of distinct NREM stages (1-4) and sleep spindles", "The shift from nasal breathing to mouth breathing", "The permanent cessation of the Moro reflex"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Around 12-16 weeks, infant sleep transitions from simple active/quiet sleep to a more complex architecture featuring distinct NREM stages, including the appearance of sleep spindles and K-complexes."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A client reports that after three nights of successful 'Graduated Extinction,' their child suddenly cried harder and longer on the fourth night than they did on the first. This is most likely an example of:",
            "options": ["An extinction burst", "Negative attachment reinforcement", "A circadian phase delay", "Sleep apnea onset"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An extinction burst is a temporary increase in the frequency or intensity of an unwanted behavior when a reinforcement (like parental presence) is first removed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Which physiological mechanism is responsible for the 'Forbidden Zone' (Wake Maintenance Zone) that occurs roughly 1-2 hours before the biological bedtime?",
            "options": ["The peak of Homeostatic Sleep Pressure (Process S)", "The lowest point of core body temperature", "The circadian alerting signal peaking to oppose sleep drive", "The initial surge of melatonin secretion"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Wake Maintenance Zone occurs when the circadian alerting signal is at its strongest, making it difficult for the child to fall asleep even if sleep pressure is high."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Research by Seehagen et al. (2015) regarding infant memory consolidation demonstrated that infants who napped for at least 30 minutes within 4 hours of learning a new task:",
            "options": ["Forgot the task faster due to 'memory pruning'", "Showed significantly better retention 24 hours later compared to non-napping infants", "Only remembered the task if the nap occurred in a dark room", "Exhibited higher cortisol levels during the learning phase"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that sleep is essential for memory consolidation in infants; those who napped shortly after learning showed superior retention of new behaviors."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Why is 'intermittent reinforcement' considered the most significant barrier to successful sleep training according to behavioral psychology?",
            "options": ["It causes the child to forget the routine", "It makes the behavior (crying for help) highly resistant to extinction", "It leads to immediate over-tiredness", "It prevents the secretion of adenosine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement—responding to a behavior only some of the time—teaches the child that persistence eventually pays off, making the habit much harder to break."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "In the Middlemiss et al. (2012) study, what specific finding regarding cortisol synchrony was observed on the third day of a sleep intervention?",
            "options": ["Both mother and infant cortisol levels returned to baseline", "Infant cortisol levels remained high even though they had stopped crying", "Maternal cortisol levels increased while infant levels decreased", "Infants produced no cortisol after the first night"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study noted a 'dissociation' where infants stopped crying (behavioral transition) but their physiological stress markers (cortisol) remained elevated, while maternal cortisol dropped in response to the lack of crying."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "When using data-driven evaluation, a 'standard deviation' in a child's night-to-night total sleep time that exceeds 60 minutes usually indicates:",
            "options": ["A very healthy, flexible sleep temperament", "High sleep consistency", "An unstable sleep-wake schedule or inconsistent environmental cues", "The need for an immediate medical referral for narcolepsy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Significant variability in total sleep time (high standard deviation) suggests that the child's circadian rhythm is not being reinforced by consistent 'zeitgebers' or routines."
