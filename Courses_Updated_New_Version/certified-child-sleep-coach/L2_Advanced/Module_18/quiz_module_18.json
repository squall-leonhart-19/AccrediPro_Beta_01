            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'U' in the S.L.U.M.B.E.R. Method™ stands for Underlying Biological and Medical Factors, ensuring that physical red flags are ruled out before behavioral interventions begin."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Snoring and anatomical markers like a high-arched palate are red flags for OSA, which requires a medical referral rather than a behavioral sleep intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "White noise should be maintained between 50-60 decibels (roughly the sound of a soft shower) to be effective yet safe for long-term infant hearing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adenosine is the byproduct of cellular energy consumption that builds up in the brain during wakefulness, creating the 'sleep pressure' required for sleep onset."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parental Pivot Fatigue occurs when parents are overwhelmed by choices and inconsistent data, leading to a breakdown in their ability to maintain the sleep plan."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistently high sleep latency (taking a long time to fall asleep) usually indicates a lack of sleep pressure, suggesting the sleep window is too early."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 Rule suggests that as long as 80% of sleep occurs in the ideal environment (the crib/bed), the remaining 20% can be flexible for travel or social events without ruining progress."
