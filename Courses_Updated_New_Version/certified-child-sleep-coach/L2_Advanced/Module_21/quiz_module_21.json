            "question": "During the Advanced Situational Assessment (S), which of the following 'red flag' symptoms requires a mandatory medical referral before any behavioral sleep intervention is implemented?",
            "options": [
                "A child waking three times per night for comfort feeds",
                "Frequent loud snoring, gasping, or labored breathing during sleep",
                "Difficulty falling asleep within 20 minutes of being placed in the crib",
                "A preference for being held during daytime naps"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Loud snoring and gasping are clinical indicators of Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSA). Behavioral sleep training is contraindicated until medical issues are ruled out or treated by a specialist."

            "question": "A coach is analyzing a sleep log for a 10-month-old. The child is in the crib for 11 hours but is only asleep for 8.5 hours. What is the Sleep Efficiency (SE) and how should the coach interpret it?",
            "options": [
                "92% SE; this is optimal and requires no schedule changes.",
                "85% SE; this is the threshold for 'good' sleep quality.",
                "77% SE; this suggests significant 'wake-and-wait' time and likely requires adjusting wake windows.",
                "65% SE; this indicates a high risk for chronic sleep deprivation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is calculated as (Total Sleep Time / Total Time in Bed) x 100. 8.5 / 11 = 77.2%. An SE below 85% in an infant usually indicates that the 'sleep pressure' is not high enough or the schedule is mismatched with the child's biological needs."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "In the 'Sensory Engineering' (L) phase, what is the specific lux level recommended to ensure zero suppression of endogenous melatonin during the night?",
            "options": [
                "Under 5.0 lux",
                "Under 2.5 lux",
                "Under 0.3 lux",
                "Exactly 10.0 lux"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that even low levels of light can suppress melatonin. A truly 'blacked out' room (under 0.3 lux) is the gold standard for optimizing the biological sleep environment."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "According to the 'U' (Biological Timing) principle, what is the primary role of adenosine in the sleep-wake homeostatic process?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a stimulant to keep the child awake during the morning.",
                "It builds up in the brain during wakefulness to increase 'sleep drive' or pressure.",
                "It is the hormone responsible for lowering core body temperature.",
                "It triggers the 'Second Wind' effect when a wake window is missed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adenosine is a byproduct of energy consumption in the brain. It accumulates during wakefulness, creating homeostatic sleep pressure. Sleep 'clears' adenosine from the system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A child is identified as 'High Intensity' and 'Low Adaptability' on the Temperament Matrix. Which Strategic Methodology Selection (M) is most likely to be successful?",
            "options": [
                "Standard Extinction (Cry It Out) because it is the fastest.",
                "A gradual 'Chair Method' with frequent physical touch to soothe the high intensity.",
                "A 'Timed Check-In' method with very short intervals to prevent escalation.",
                "A highly consistent, low-stimulation approach that minimizes 'parental hovering' which may overstimulate the child."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "High-intensity children often become more escalated by 'intermittent' parental presence (hovering). A consistent approach that minimizes sensory overstimulation while providing a clear boundary is often more effective than frequent checks."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "When drafting the Professional Sleep Plan Document (L6), why is it recommended to include a 'Contingency Protocol' for short naps?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the parent knows exactly how to adjust the next wake window to prevent overtiredness.",
                "To encourage the parent to give up on naps for the day.",
                "To provide a list of alternative sleep consultants if the plan fails.",
                "To justify charging an extra fee for 'emergency' nap support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Short naps (under 45 minutes) often lead to a 'crash' in sleep pressure later in the day. A professional plan must provide specific instructions on how to shorten the subsequent wake window to maintain biological timing."

        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In Behavioral Consistency coaching (B), 'Intermittent Reinforcement' is defined as:",
            "options": [
                "Consistently responding to a child's cry every single time.",
                "Never responding to a child's cry under any circumstances.",
                "Occasionally rewarding a behavior (like crying) by giving in, which makes the behavior more resistant to change.",
                "The process of switching between different white noise sounds."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement is the strongest form of operant conditioning. If a parent 'gives in' and provides a sleep prop after 40 minutes of crying, the child learns that persistence eventually works, making the behavior harder to extinguish."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "During the Evaluation (E) phase, a client reports that the child was doing great for 3 days but is now crying harder than ever on Night 4. What is this phenomenon called?",
            "options": [
                "Developmental Regression",

                "Biological Misalignment",
                "Schedule Failure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An 'Extinction Burst' is a temporary increase in the frequency or intensity of an unwanted behavior just before it begins to diminish. It is a sign that the intervention is working and the child is 'testing' the new boundary."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A 6-month-old is currently taking 4 short naps a day and has a bedtime of 9:00 PM. The goal is to move to a 3-nap schedule with a 7:00 PM bedtime. How should this be implemented?",
            "options": [
                "Move the bedtime by 2 hours immediately on Day 1.",
                "Gradually shift the entire schedule earlier by 15-30 minutes every 2-3 days while monitoring wake windows.",
                "Keep the 9:00 PM bedtime but wake the child up earlier in the morning.",
                "Eliminate the 4th nap immediately and hope the child compensates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Refinement' (R) process requires gradual shifts to allow the circadian rhythm to catch up. Sudden 2-hour shifts often lead to extreme overtiredness and a breakdown in the sleep training process."

        {
            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Maintenance' portion of the final sleep plan?",
            "options": [
                "To sell the client a monthly subscription for ongoing support.",
                "To provide a 'What to do when...' guide for illness, travel, and teething to prevent a total relapse.",
                "To instruct the parents to never leave the house during nap time again.",
                "To explain how to transition the child to a toddler bed immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintenance is about empowering parents to handle inevitable 'life' disruptions (illness, travel) without losing the progress they have made in behavioral consistency."
