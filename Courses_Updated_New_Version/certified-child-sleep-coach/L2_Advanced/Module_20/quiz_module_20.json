            "question": "During the Advanced Sleep Intake Process (L1), why is it critical to investigate the 'Multi-Generational Sleep Narrative'?",
            "options": [
                "To determine if the child's sleep issues are purely behavioral and unrelated to genetics",
                "To identify inherited sleep phenotypes and parental beliefs that may influence adherence to the coaching plan",
                "To prove to the parents that their own sleep habits are the sole cause of the child's issues",
                "To fill out the intake form for insurance billing purposes only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced coaching looks at sleep phenotypes (genetic predispositions) and parental 'sleep scripts'—beliefs passed down through generations—which significantly impact how a family responds to sleep interventions."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A 10-month-old's sleep log shows 11 hours 'Time in Bed' (TIB) but only 8.5 hours 'Total Sleep Time' (TST). What is the Sleep Efficiency (SE) percentage, and what does it indicate?",
            "options": [
                "92%; this indicates excellent sleep consolidation",
                "85%; this is the average for this age group",
                "77%; this suggests significant wakefulness and poor sleep consolidation",
                "65%; this indicates a severe medical sleep disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is calculated as (TST / TIB) x 100. In this case, (8.5 / 11) = 77.2%. For pediatric populations, an SE below 85% typically indicates significant fragmented sleep or an inappropriate schedule."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In Environmental Auditing (L3), what is the maximum recommended light level (in lux) for a child's sleep environment to avoid suppressing melatonin production?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5 lux",
                "Between 20 and 30 lux",
                "Exactly 50 lux",
                "Lux levels do not matter as long as the light is red-toned"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that even low levels of light can suppress melatonin. A professional environmental audit aims for 'cave-like' darkness, ideally measuring less than 5 lux using a light meter."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Biometric Technology, what is the primary limitation of using consumer-grade wearables for infant sleep tracking?",
            "options": [
                "They are too expensive for the average family to afford",
                "The 'Validation Gap'—they often overestimate sleep by mistaking quiet wakefulness for sleep",
                "They provide too much data on Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which is confusing",
                "They are 100% accurate and should be used instead of manual sleep logs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consumer wearables primarily use accelerometry (movement). Because infants can be very still while awake, these devices frequently overestimate Total Sleep Time (TST) and underestimate Sleep Onset Latency (SOL)."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "When screening for milestones (L5), why is the '4-month regression' considered a permanent physiological shift rather than a temporary disruption?",
            "options": [
                "The infant's brain begins to produce cortisol for the first time",
                "The infant's sleep architecture transitions from a 2-stage newborn pattern to a 4-stage adult-like pattern",
                "The infant loses the Moro reflex, which causes them to wake up more frequently",
                "It is the age when most infants begin consuming solid foods, affecting digestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At approximately 4 months, sleep architecture matures. The introduction of NREM Stage 1 and 2 means the child transitions through lighter stages of sleep, making them more prone to waking if they lack independent sleep skills."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A client's child is described as 'slow-to-warm-up' with high sensory sensitivity. Based on Temperament Profiling (L6), which coaching approach is most likely to be successful?",
            "options": [
                "Extinction (Cry It Out) to ensure the fastest results",
                "A 'Cold Turkey' transition from co-sleeping to a crib",
                "A gradual fading method with high parental presence to support sensory regulation",
                "Ignoring the temperament and following a standard 7-to-7 schedule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children with high sensory sensitivity and 'slow-to-warm-up' temperaments often experience heightened cortisol spikes during abrupt changes. A gradual approach helps maintain the 'Optimal Stimulation Zone' for learning."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Which of the following 'Red Flags' identified in Lesson 7 (Clinical Screening) requires an immediate referral to a pediatric sleep physician or ENT?",
            "options": [
                "The child cries for 10 minutes before falling asleep",
                "The child wakes up once a night for a feeding at 6 months old",
                "The child exhibits habitual snoring, mouth breathing, or paradoxical chest movement",
                "The child prefers to sleep with a specific stuffed animal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Snoring, mouth breathing, and paradoxical breathing are clinical indicators of Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) or Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which are medical issues that cannot be solved with behavioral coaching."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the S.L.U.M.B.E.R. Assessment Matrix (L8), what does the 'M' represent, and why is it assessed?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin; to check if the child needs supplements",
                "Mindset; to assess the parents' emotional readiness and self-efficacy",
                "Movement; to track motor milestones like crawling",
                "Midnight; to analyze the specific timing of middle-of-the-night wakes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindset refers to the parents' psychological state. If a parent has low self-efficacy or high anxiety, they are less likely to remain consistent with the sleep plan, necessitating a more supportive coaching style."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A 9-month-old client has suddenly started waking 4-5 times a night after previously sleeping through. The parents note he is 'practicing pulling up in the crib.' How should this be assessed using the Module 20 tools?",
            "options": [
                "As a behavioral regression requiring a stricter discipline plan",
                "As a developmental milestone disruption (L5), where sleep usually normalizes within 2-3 weeks of skill mastery",
                "As a sign that the child is ready to drop to one nap early",
                "As a nutritional deficiency requiring more calories during the day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motor milestones like pulling to stand create 'milestone-related wakefulness.' The brain prioritizes motor learning over sleep consolidation. Assessment tools help identify this as a temporary developmental phase."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "When auditing the 'Location' (L) in the S.L.U.M.B.E.R. Matrix, which factor is most likely to cause 'Social Signaling' wakes?",
            "options": [
                "A room temperature of 68°F (20°C)",
                "The use of a 1.0 TOG sleep sack",
                "Sharing a room with parents where the child can see/smell the parents during light sleep cycles",
                "The presence of a white noise machine set to 50 decibels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Social signaling occurs when a child detects a parent's presence (sight/smell) during a normal arousal between sleep cycles, which often triggers a full wake-up as the child seeks social interaction or comfort."
