            "question": "When a child presents with chronic snoring, mouth breathing, and 'sweaty' sleep, which medical overlay should a coach prioritize for a medical referral?",
            "options": [
                "Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)",
                "Silent Gastroesophageal Reflux",
                "Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA)",
                "Night Terrors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "These are classic red flags for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Coaches must refer to a pediatrician or ENT, as sleep training is contraindicated until the airway is cleared."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the 'Synchronized Schedule' strategy for twins, what is the recommended maximum time gap to allow between the first twin waking and waking the second twin for a nap?",
            "options": [
                "5 minutes",
                "15–30 minutes",
                "45 minutes",
                "60 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain a manageable schedule for the parents, it is recommended to wake the second twin within 15–30 minutes of the first to keep their biological clocks synchronized."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "Research indicates that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often face sleep challenges due to which physiological factor?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive daytime cortisol production",
                "Hyper-metabolism of dietary fats",
                "Irregular or lower endogenous melatonin secretion",
                "Accelerated circadian rhythms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that children with ASD often have lower levels of melatonin or a delayed release of melatonin, making sleep onset particularly difficult."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "For a 'Spirited' child with high sensory sensitivity, which modification to the standard sleep plan is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "Shortening the wind-down routine to avoid overstimulation",
                "Implementing a 'Cold Turkey' extinction method immediately",
                "Extending the wind-down routine to 45–60 minutes in a low-stimulus environment",
                "Increasing daytime activity in the hour immediately preceding bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spirited or high-needs children often have a harder time down-regulating. A significantly longer, low-sensory wind-down helps their nervous system transition to sleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When traveling across multiple time zones, which direction of travel is generally considered more difficult for a child's circadian adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "Traveling North",
                "Traveling South",
                "Traveling West (Phase Delay)",
                "Traveling East (Phase Advance)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Traveling East is harder because it requires 'phase advance' (going to bed earlier), which goes against the body's natural tendency to drift toward a slightly longer day."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A coach notices a client is exhibiting signs of Postnatal Depression (PND), including hopelessness and an inability to bond. What is the appropriate professional boundary?",
            "options": [
                "Provide basic counseling and adjust the sleep plan to be more aggressive",
                "Refer the parent to a licensed mental health professional immediately",
                "Suggest specific herbal supplements for the parent's mood",
                "Ignore the symptoms and focus strictly on the child's sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep coaches are not qualified to diagnose or treat mental health disorders. If PND is suspected, a referral to a professional is mandatory for the safety of the parent and child."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary characteristic of a Night Terror (Sleep Terror) compared to a Nightmare?",
            "options": [
                "The child remembers the event clearly the next morning",
                "It occurs during REM sleep in the early morning hours",
                "The child is inconsolable but remains in a state of deep NREM sleep",
                "The child seeks comfort from the parent and wakes up fully"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Night terrors occur during deep NREM sleep, usually in the first third of the night. The child appears awake but is not, and will have no memory of it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "What is the most common cause of 'Chronic Relapse' in a sleep-trained toddler who previously slept well?",
            "options": [
                "Intermittent reinforcement of old sleep associations",
                "A permanent change in the child's personality",
                "The child outgrowing the need for a 12-hour night",
                "The 'extinction burst' occurring 6 months late"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Relapse is almost always caused by 'Intermittent Reinforcement'—where a parent occasionally returns to old habits (like co-sleeping or feeding to sleep) during illness or travel."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "In a shared room dynamic between a 4-month-old and a 3-year-old, what is the best strategy to prevent the toddler from waking the baby?",
            "options": [
                "Putting both children to bed at the exact same time",
                "Staggered bedtimes, with the younger child going down first",
                "Using a single white noise machine placed between the two beds",
                "Moving the toddler to the parent's room for two weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Staggering bedtimes allows the younger child (who usually has an earlier bedtime) to be deeply asleep before the older child enters the room."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "According to the AAP, how should a baby with diagnosed Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) be positioned for sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS?",
            "options": [
                "At a 30-degree incline using a wedge",
                "On their side to prevent choking on spit-up",
                "On their stomach (prone) once they have head control",
                "Flat on their back on a firm, flat sleep surface"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The AAP is clear: despite reflux, babies should always sleep flat on their back. Elevating the head is not proven to reduce reflux and increases the risk of the baby sliding into a position that compromises the airway."
