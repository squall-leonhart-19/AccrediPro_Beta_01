            "question": "A child presents with heavy mouth breathing, excessive sweating during sleep, and frequent night terrors. According to Lesson 1, what is the most critical professional action for a sleep coach?",
            "options": [
                "Implement a gradual extinction method to reduce night terrors.",
                "Recommend a high-calorie snack before bed to stabilize blood sugar.",
                "Pause sleep coaching and refer the family to a pediatric ENT for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) screening.",
                "Adjust the room temperature to 65°F and use a weighted blanket."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Symptoms like mouth breathing, sweating, and frequent parasomnias are 'red flags' for OSA. A sleep coach must refer to a medical professional before proceeding with behavioral interventions."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 2 indicates that what percentage of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience significant sleep disturbances?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "40-50%",
                "Up to 80%",
                "Exactly 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that up to 80% of children with ASD struggle with sleep, often due to biological differences in melatonin production and sensory processing challenges."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "When coaching twins who share a room, what is the 'Staggered Bedtime' strategy used for?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the parents get a break between children.",
                "To allow one child to fall asleep independently before the second child is brought into the room.",
                "To prevent the 'Twin Synchronicity' effect.",
                "To ensure the children never see each other during the bedtime routine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Staggering bedtimes by 15-30 minutes allows a coach to work on independent sleep with one child without the distraction or noise of the sibling, eventually leading to a synchronized schedule."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 regarding Trauma-Informed Coaching, why is 'Cry It Out' (CIO) generally discouraged for children in foster care or recently adopted?",
            "options": [
                "Because these children have a higher threshold for pain.",
                "Because it can re-trigger attachment-related trauma and feelings of abandonment.",
                "Because foster children are usually older and CIO only works for infants.",
                "Because it is illegal in most foster care agency guidelines."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children with a history of trauma or attachment disruption require high-responsivity methods. Extinction-based methods can exacerbate existing trauma and damage the developing bond with the new caregiver."

                "Push for the fastest results possible to ensure the mother gets sleep immediately.",
                "Require the mother to do all the nighttime responses to build her confidence.",
                "Implement a 'low-friction' plan with small, incremental changes and involve a support person (partner/grandparent) for night duties.",
                "Refuse to work with the family until the mother is fully recovered."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-stress coaching can worsen PMPDs. A low-friction, supportive approach that utilizes the family's support system helps achieve results without overwhelming the struggling parent."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "After a week-long hospitalization for a chronic illness, a toddler has lost all previous sleep skills. What is the recommended 'Re-entry' timeline discussed in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate return to strict boundaries on the first night home.",
                "A 3-5 day 'Grace Period' for reconnection followed by a gradual return to the original routine.",
                "Wait at least one month before re-introducing any sleep rules.",
                "Switch to co-sleeping permanently to monitor the child's health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Grace Period' allows the child to feel safe and re-regulated after the trauma of hospitalization before the family re-implements boundaries and independent sleep expectations."

            "options": [
                "Tell the parents to ignore the grandmother's input entirely.",
                "Include the grandmother in the 'Why' session to explain the science of sleep and the benefits for the child's development.",
                "Change the plan to match the grandmother's preferences to keep the peace.",
                "Charge the family a 'difficulty fee' for the extra communication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gaining 'buy-in' from all caregivers in the home is essential for consistency. Educating extended family members on the 'why' helps reduce friction and increases the success rate."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "Traveling in which direction typically causes the most significant 'jet lag' disruption for a child's circadian rhythm?",
            "options": [
                "Traveling West (Phase Delay)",
                "Traveling South (No time change)",
                "Traveling East (Phase Advance)",
                "Traveling North (No time change)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Traveling East is generally harder because it requires the body to 'advance' its clock (go to bed earlier), which is more difficult than 'delaying' the clock when traveling West."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client's 4-month-old has severe Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD). The parents want to use a 30-degree incline wedge in the crib. Based on Lesson 1 and AAP guidelines, how should you respond?",
            "options": [
                "Agree, as the incline helps keep stomach acid down.",
                "Advise that while it helps reflux, it increases the risk of SIDS/suffocation and the baby must sleep flat on their back.",
                "Suggest they use a car seat for sleep instead.",
                "Tell them to double the dose of reflux medication so they don't need the wedge."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AAP is clear: all infants should sleep on a flat, firm surface. Inclined sleepers and wedges are unsafe, regardless of reflux status. Sleep coaches must prioritize safe sleep guidelines."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A child with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) is 'sensory seeking' and cannot settle at night. Which environmental adjustment is recommended in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "Using a bright nightlight to provide visual stimulation.",
                "Increasing the volume of the white noise to 85 decibels.",
                "Incorporating 'heavy work' or proprioceptive input (like a firm massage or 'burrito roll' in a blanket) into the bedtime routine.",
                "Eliminating the bedtime routine entirely to avoid overstimulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input (heavy work) provides calming 'deep pressure' that helps sensory-seeking children regulate their nervous systems and prepare for sleep."
